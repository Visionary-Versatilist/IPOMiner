      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        The information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed. We may not sell these securities until the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and is not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.

          SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JANUARY 5, 2018

        
          PRELIMINARY PROSPECTUS 
        
        $300,000,000 
        One Madison Corporation 
        30,000,000 Units 

          One Madison Corporation is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our “initial business combination.” We are founded and controlled by Omar Asali, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We have not identified any potential business combination target, and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. 

        This is an initial public offering of our securities. Each unit has an offering price of  $10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of  $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, as described herein. Only whole warrants are exercisable. We have granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. 
        We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem 100% of the public shares for cash upon the expiration of such 24-month period, subject to applicable law and certain conditions as described herein. See “Summary — The Offering — Redemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no initial business combination.” 

          Certain investors (including Mr. Asali and each of our other executive officers), whom we refer to collectively as “anchor investors,” together with the BSOF Entities (as defined below), have agreed to purchase 8,000,000 warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of this offering. One Madison Group LLC (our “sponsor”), entities affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. (collectively, the “BSOF Entities”), and the anchor investors own 12,375,000 Class B ordinary shares as of the date of this prospectus, which will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, at the time of our initial business combination as described herein and in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Class C ordinary shares are convertible into Class A ordinary shares as described under “Summary — The Offering — Forward Purchase Agreements.” 

        The anchor investors have entered into forward purchase agreements with us which provide for the purchase by the anchor investors of an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, plus an aggregate of 5,000,000 redeemable warrants to purchase one Class A ordinary share or one Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of  $150,000,000, or $10.00 per Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. The obligations under the forward purchase agreements do not depend on whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders. In connection with these agreements, we issued the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 Class B ordinary shares, which represent 33.33% of the Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option).

          In addition, we and our sponsor have entered into a strategic partnership agreement with the BSOF Entities pursuant to which such entities have agreed to act as a strategic partner and may provide debt or equity financing in connection with our initial business combination. See “Summary — Strategic Partnership Agreement with the BSOF Entities.”


          Currently, there is no public market for our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants. We have applied to have our units listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “OMAD.U” on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing. We expect the Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units to begin separate trading on the NYSE under the symbols “OMAD” and “OMAD.W,” respectively, on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless the representatives of the underwriters permit earlier separate trading and we have satisfied certain conditions. 

        
          ​
        
        We are an “emerging growth company” under applicable federal securities laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32 for a discussion of information that should be considered in connection with an investment in our securities. Investors will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings.

          General 

            We are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our “initial business combination.” We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. 

          Our founder, Omar Asali, is Chairman and CEO of One Madison Group LLC, our sponsor, a privately owned investment company. Our sponsor seeks to build an industry leading sustainable operating business with high returns on invested capital and robust free cash flow generation. We intend to take a patient and disciplined approach to investing with an emphasis on compounding capital over the long-term. We intend to partner with excellent management teams and foster an ownership culture with strong alignment of incentives. Our management team has deep expertise across multiple industries and regions as well as an extensive network of industry and functional experts that can be valuable resources to our investments. We will be further supported by our operating and advisory committee comprised of four former senior executives from leading global consumer and industrial companies with experience in a wide range of sub-sectors and functional areas, who will provide us with access to their expertise and extensive industry networks from which we intend to source and evaluate targets as well as devise plans to optimize any business that we acquire. 
          While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or location, we intend to focus on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses based predominantly in North America with global reach. We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire in the following categories: (i) consumer products or services, (ii) food and beverage and (iii) adjacent manufacturing or industrial

          services businesses linked to a consumer end-user. We intend to target businesses that have stable cash flows, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects over the long term. Our management and our operating and advisory committee have extensive experience not only identifying and executing the acquisition of private and public companies, but also the running and operating of businesses post-transaction. 
          Successful companies in the consumer products sector traditionally have had several characteristics that make them unique and highly sought after, including their ability to generate strong free cash flow and operate throughout various economic cycles. Such companies typically had strong margin profiles, returns on invested capital greater than their cost of capital, strong demand for their products, proven product development capability, a diverse distribution network with deep retailer relationships as well as an efficient and robust supply chain that can meet evolving customer needs. These businesses also have been able to support strong cash flow generation and growth, both through increasing top line revenue from improved distribution and product development as well as a sharp focus on achieving greater operating efficiencies and process improvements. Effective management teams with a clear set of long-term goals and proper incentives are integral to building leading sustainable businesses in the space. 
          Recent developments in e-commerce, social media, digital marketing, and direct-to-consumer distribution are rapidly altering the competitive landscape, primarily by reducing the barriers to entry and changing the way consumers learn about and interact with companies and their products. These changes have attracted a large number of entrepreneurs and venture investors in categories long-dominated by large established companies. Many traditional consumer companies are facing a range of unique market and industry dynamics that we believe will create attractive opportunities for our company to pursue. In particular, traditional consumer products companies are confronted with new and disruptive business models primarily driven by advancements in technology along with the growth of e-commerce and niche product lines, resulting in significant changes to consumer spending behavior and purchasing habits as well as retail and distribution networks. As a result, larger, global consumer products companies, under pressure by the marketplace, activist investors and competition from smaller and more nimble companies, have announced plans to divest certain brands and non-core businesses as a means to cut costs and re-focus on key products. In addition, other privately-owned businesses are seeking new long-term owners and capital providers in order to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving consumer landscape. Through Mr. Asali and our operating and advisory committee members, we believe we have assembled a team whose broad-based industry experience, deep network and extensive functional expertise in areas such as operations, manufacturing, supply chain optimization, financial management, capital markets, sales and marketing and e-commerce can significantly improve the outlook for the business we acquire. Our operating and advisory committee has in-depth knowledge and global experience in a variety of industries touching the consumer including: food and beverage, pet products, household products and appliances, tools and building products as well as garden and outdoor products. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this disruption and capitalize on potential opportunities. We believe our collective experience and skillset will allow us to understand the impact of current disruption, identify attractive opportunities and develop an effective value creation strategy post-acquisition, including reshaping operating strategy and infrastructure to better address the challenges discussed above. 
          We believe our sponsor and anchor investors, who share our long-term approach to capital allocation and strategic decision making, will assist us in implementing our objectives and are a key differentiator for our company. Our sponsor and anchor investors are focused on compounding equity value over the long-term. Our sponsor believes that it takes discipline, long-term perspective, strategic thinking, and proper resources to build a business with industry-leading operating efficiencies and that can serve as an attractive growth platform for future accretive acquisitions. We believe sellers of family-owned businesses would seek to transition ownership of a business they have built over many years and in some cases, generations, to a company focused on building and achieving a positive and sustainable outcome for all stakeholders. Our sponsor is focused on implementing a conservative capital structure that provides the business with the flexibility it needs to weather cycles and evolve in a dynamic competitive landscape. Our sponsor is focused on the preservation of capital and intends to implement a capital structure that reflects this mindset.

            Mr. Asali has an extensive background of relevant industry and public company experience. Most recently, he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of HRG Group, a publicly traded diversified holding company (“HRG”), from March 2015 until April 2017, as its President since October 2011 and a director from May 2011 to April 2017. In addition to HRG, Mr. Asali served as Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. (“Spectrum Brands”), HRG’s majority owned and NYSE listed consumer products company with an $8.3 billion market capitalization at the time of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG, and as a member of the board of directors of Fidelity & Guaranty Life (formerly the US Life and Annuity business of Old Mutual PLC, “FGL”), HRG’s majority owned NYSE-listed insurance company, which had a $1.6 billion market capitalization at the time of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG. As Chief Executive Officer and President of HRG, Mr. Asali was responsible for overseeing its day-to-day activities, including M&A activity and overall business strategy for HRG and its subsidiaries as well as identifying performance metrics to better align management teams with meeting business objectives. During his time at HRG, Mr. Asali was directly involved in all of HRG’s acquisitions across all sectors and was actively involved in HRG’s management and investment activities. Under Mr. Asali’s leadership, HRG achieved substantial shareholder value both organically and through strategic transactions. During this time: 

          •
          HRG grew from a public shell company with a market capitalization of  $119 million in 2010 into a diversified holding company with a market capitalization of  $3.9 billion as of April 14, 2017, the date of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG. HRG completed numerous successful financings over this time period and lowered its blended cost of debt from 10.625% to 7.8%. 
          ​
          •
          HRG shareholders achieved returns of 286% (or a compound annual growth rate of greater than 27%) from the time Mr. Asali became President in October 2011 until his departure in April of 2017 and HRG’s key subsidiaries also achieved strong returns. Spectrum Brand’s share price appreciated 497% in that timeframe while HRG’s investment in FGL achieved a total rate of return of 399%. 
          ​
          •
          HRG acquired FGL in 2011 for $300 million (net of a $50 million purchase price adjustment). In December 2013, FGL completed a successful partial initial public offering of 11.2 million shares at $17.00, valuing HRG’s remaining stake of approximately 80% at approximately $799 million and paying HRG a special dividend of  $43 million from the offering proceeds. FGL recently undertook a strategic sale process that ultimately resulted in the announced sale to CF Corp. for $31.10 per share, valuing HRG’s stake at $1.46 billion and resulting, assuming completion, in a total return of greater than 450% for HRG shareholders since inception. 
          ​

            •
            HRG acquired Spectrum Brands from Harbinger Capital Partners, LLC (“Harbinger Capital”) in January of 2011. Spectrum Brands acquired Stanley Black & Decker’s Hardware & Home Improvement Group as well as Armored AutoGroup for $1.4 billion each and completed numerous tuck-in acquisitions as well as debt and equity financings. Shares in Spectrum Brands increased by 497% from October 2011 to April 14, 2017. In that time period Spectrum Brand’s market capitalization increased from $1.2 billion to approximately $8.3 billion. 
            ​


            Additionally, during the time Mr. Asali served as President, HRG held investments in various financing, asset management, re-insurance and oil and gas firms, including CorAmerica Capital, LLC, Salus Capital Partners, LLC, and Compass Production Partners, LP. See “Proposed Business — Our Management Team.” Prior to becoming President of HRG, Mr. Asali was a Managing Director and Head of Global Strategy of Harbinger Capital where he was responsible for global portfolio strategy and business development. Before joining Harbinger Capital in 2009, Mr. Asali was the co-head of Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund Strategies (“Goldman Sachs HFS”) where he helped manage approximately $25 billion of capital allocated to external managers. Mr. Asali also served as co-chair of the Investment Committee at Goldman Sachs HFS. Before joining Goldman Sachs HFS in 2003, Mr. Asali worked in Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division, providing M&A and strategic advisory services to clients in the High Technology Group. Mr. Asali previously worked at Capital Guidance, a boutique private equity firm. Mr. Asali began his career working for a public accounting firm. Mr. Asali received an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.S. in Accounting from Virginia Tech.

          With respect to the foregoing experiences of Mr. Asali, past performance is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance. None of our officers has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies. 

            We believe our ability to complete an initial business combination will be enhanced by our having entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants, for a purchase price of  $10.00 per Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. We believe this committed capital will provide us with greater certainty to complete a business combination with potential sellers. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase shares may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. These purchases will be made regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination.


            On December 15, 2017, we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with our sponsor and the BSOF Entities pursuant to which our sponsor transferred 525,000 founder shares and the BSOF Entities have agreed to act as our strategic partner and may provide debt or equity financing in connection with our initial business combination, but are not required to do so. The founder shares held by the BSOF Entities are subject to certain transfer restrictions, forfeiture and earnout provisions similar to those imposed upon our sponsor and the anchor investors. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have agreed to vote any founder shares they may own in favor of such initial business combination. The BSOF Entities may designate one observer to our board of directors until the consummation of our initial business combination. The BSOF Entities have also separately agreed to purchase an aggregate of 560,000 private placement warrants, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of this offering. Such private placement warrants will have the same terms and conditions as those to be purchased by our anchor investors. The BSOF Entities will be entitled to registration rights with respect any ordinary shares and warrants held by them. We believe that the combination of capital provided by our anchor investors and a strategic partnership with the BSOF Entities will provide us with a material advantage in effecting an initial business combination.

          Business Strategy 
          Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of Mr. Asali and our operating and advisory committee and can benefit from their collective experiences and expertise to build shareholder value over the long-term. Key aspects of our business strategy will include: 
          •
          Sourcing investment opportunities through the broad and deep industry relationships of Mr. Asali, our operating and advisory committee, and some of our anchor investors. Mr. Asali has developed a broad range of relationships with industry leaders, investments bankers, consultants, legal advisors, financial sponsors, family offices, institutional investors and capital providers. Our operating and advisory committee members will help our sponsor formulate a clear strategy for the acquired business once a business combination is consummated. This committee could also be a potential source of new management and advisors for the acquired company. Finally, our anchor investors are distinguished family offices that we believe can provide us with access to unique pools of capital and investment opportunities from within the family office community. 
          ​
          •
          Targeting consumer products companies with attractive brands, strong management teams and scalable platforms. Sub-sectors on which we plan to focus include, but are not limited to, tools and

          building products, food and beverage, household products, garden and outdoor, lifestyle and experience. We intend to source acquisition opportunities from a number of sources, such as family owners, financial sponsors and corporate carve-outs. 
          •
          Implementing a strategy aimed at operational improvements such as margin improvement, free cash flow conversion, distribution and supply chain efficiencies and SG&A efficiencies. We believe these steps will help us create shareholder value by improving returns on invested capital while lowering the cost of capital of the acquired business. In addition, we will plan to grow through strategic acquisitions in comparable as well as adjacent categories. We will pursue tuck-in acquisitions as well as larger transactions that we believe will improve the overall business profile and be accretive to shareholders. 
          ​
          •
          Generating long-term shareholder value, consistent with our management team’s experience and capabilities and long-term investment horizons of our anchor investors. We believe this strategy will position us well to operate, adapt and grow any business that we acquire through multiple cycles. Furthermore, we believe that this approach differentiates and positions us well with current like-minded, long-term oriented owners of target businesses potentially making them more receptive to transact with us. 
          ​
          •
          Implementing a capital structure that reflects our focus on preservation of capital and maintaining operational flexibility while building a diversified platform. 
          ​
          •
          Implementing centralized capital allocation and decentralized operations with a cost-effective management team and a pay-for-performance culture. 
          ​
          Acquisition Criteria 
          Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe have: 
          •
          Strong Brands and Leading Market Positions: We intend to seek companies with strong brands and leading market positions that we believe are highly sought after by consumers and distributors, can perform through various cycles and withstand disruptive developments to the business. We intend to seek highly attractive brands that offer compelling value to consumers that we can distribute through a variety of channels. 
          ​
          •
          Product Development and Manufacturing Infrastructure: We intend to pursue a target with a proven track record of strong operational execution and that has control over a substantial amount of their manufacturing processes. While we are focused on companies with low capital intensity and limited required maintenance capital expenditures, we believe owning a solid manufacturing footprint would provide greater control over quality of products manufactured, cost management, and achieving operational efficiencies while also providing opportunity for expansion in product lines and geographies. We also intend to pursue a target with a culture of product development and innovation to maintain relevancy for existing products and build brands that resonate in households worldwide. 
          ​
          •
          Scalable Platform: We intend to acquire platforms that provide the infrastructure and capacity necessary to grow through new product launches and acquisitions while maintaining a competitive existing operating cost structure to enable management to pursue consolidation opportunities and realize synergies. We intend to focus on businesses that operate within a fragmented space where we can utilize our skill-sets to consolidate a number of attractive businesses over time. 
          ​
          •
          Experienced Management: While our management and our operating and advisory committee bring industry expertise that will assist in identifying acquisition opportunities and could serve as a source of management talent, we intend to focus on companies with strong existing management teams that are well positioned to continue running the business and will benefit from access to our expertise and experiences, networks and capital.

          •
          Opportunities for Improved Strategic Planning and Incentive Structures: We intend to focus on identifying opportunities to improve existing business plans using our collective experience from different businesses. We further intend to focus on identifying metrics and developing incentive plans that will align managers with meeting near term business goals while building long-term shareholder value. 
          ​
          •
          Attractive Cash Flow: We intend to target companies with strong free cash flow generation from existing products, high profit margins (or a path to obtaining them) and revenue where we have strong visibility or that is recurring. 
          ​
          •
          Opportunity for Operational Improvement: We intend to target companies where we believe there is capacity to improve the penetration of the existing product line and optimize work flow processes and distribution networks to lower costs, adapt to a changing market environment and become more competitive. 
          ​
          •
          Attributes to Benefit as a Public Company: We intend to target companies that could benefit from access to the public equity markets with new holders and long-term investors that will support the company’s growth objectives. We also expect to benefit from access to the term debt markets where our sponsor has a proven track record of successfully completing financings and protecting the principal of capital providers. We expect to develop a capital structure that is appropriate for the target company while lowering our cost of capital. 
          ​
          Initial Business Combination 
          NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
          We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding 
        
      
      
        7
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        
          capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
          Our Acquisition Process 
          In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 
          We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view and follow such other procedures as set forth in our related party transaction policy (see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions — Related Party Transaction Policy”). 

            Each of our directors and officers will own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 


            Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

          Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering. 
          Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.

          We are a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated on July 13, 2017. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and expect to receive, after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2011 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
          We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
          In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
          We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.

          The Offering 
          In deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the backgrounds of the members of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company and the fact that this offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section below entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32 of this prospectus. 
          
            Securities offered 
          
          30,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, each unit consisting of:
          •
          one Class A ordinary share; and
          ​
          •
          one-half of one redeemable warrant.

            Trading commencement and separation of Class A ordinary shares and warrants 
          
          The units are expected to begin trading on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. The Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the Class A ordinary shares and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. 
          
            Separate trading of the Class A ordinary shares and warrants is prohibited until we have filed a Current Report on Form 8-K 
          
          In no event will the Class A ordinary shares and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds at the closing of this offering. We anticipate filing such Current Report four business days from the closing of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.

          Founder shares are currently classified as Class B ordinary shares, which shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) at the time of our initial business combination as described below adjacent to the caption “Founder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights.” 
          ​

          Includes 30,000,000 public shares and 11,250,000 founder shares.

            Exercisability 
          
          Each whole warrant offered in this offering is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share. Only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade.
          We structured each unit to contain one-half of one warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable for one Class A ordinary share, as compared to units issued by some other similar blank check companies which contain whole warrants exercisable for one whole share, in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination as compared to units that each contain a warrant to purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive business combination partner for target businesses.
          The private placement warrants and forward purchase warrants will be exercisable on the same terms as the warrants offered as part of the units, except that, pursuant to the applicable forward

            Exercise price 
          
          $11.50 per whole share, subject to adjustments as described herein. 
          
            Exercise period 
          
          The public warrants will become exercisable on the later of: 
          •
          30 days after the completion of our initial business combination; and
          ​
          •
          12 months from the closing of this offering;
          ​
          provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder (or we permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement). If and when the public warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.

            We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants, forward purchase warrants or private placement warrants at this time. However, we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of the public warrants, forward purchase warrants or private placement warrants. We will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares until such warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares and the Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants is not effective by the 60th day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.

          The warrants will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. On the exercise of any warrant, the warrant exercise price will be paid directly to us and not placed in the trust account.

            Redemption of warrants 
          
          Once the warrants become exercisable, we may redeem the outstanding warrants (except as described herein with respect to the private placement warrants):
          •
          in whole and not in part;
          ​
          •
          at a price of  $0.01 per warrant;
          ​
          •
          upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, which we refer to as the 30-day redemption period; and
          ​

            •
            if, and only if, the last sales price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
            ​

          We will not redeem the warrants unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day redemption period, except if the warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act.
          If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” will mean the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. Please see “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ Warrants” for additional information.

            The forward purchase warrants will be redeemable on the same terms as the warrants offered as part of the units. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial anchor investors or the BSOF Entities who purchased such warrants or their respective permitted transferees.

              Forward Purchase Agreements; Strategic Partnership Agreement 
            


            Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 15,000,000 ordinary shares (13,025,000 Class A ordinary shares and 1,975,000 Class C ordinary shares) plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants (of which 4,341,667 will be exercisable for Class A ordinary shares and 658,333 will be exercisable for Class C ordinary shares) for a purchase price of  $10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares purchased, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The Class A ordinary shares, Class C ordinary shares and warrants to be purchased by the anchor investors are referred to herein as the “forward purchase securities.” In connection with these agreements, we also issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. In connection with the strategic partnership agreement, our sponsor transferred 525,000 founder shares to the BSOF Entities. Subject to certain exceptions to forfeiture, transfer and earnout provisions, the founder shares issued to the anchor investors and held by the BSOF Entities are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants except that one of the anchor investors will receive forward purchase warrants exercisable only for Class C ordinary shares, as described above.

          Upon execution of the forward purchase agreements, each anchor investor elected to receive a fixed number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares, except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that the Class C ordinary shares may be converted into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis (i) at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or (ii) upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary share to an unaffiliated third party.

            The forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement also provide that the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities are entitled to (i) a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans from our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) by us, including for capital raising purposes, or if we offer or seek commitments for any equity or equity-linked securities to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than the units we are offering by this prospectus and their component public shares and warrants, the founder shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for which such founder shares are convertible), the forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants and the private placement warrants, and any securities issued by us as

            consideration to any seller in our initial business combination and warrants issued upon the conversion of working capital loans to us made by our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) and (ii) registration rights with respect to (A) the forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and the BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, including any time after we complete our initial business combination.

          The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable.

            In addition, the forward purchase agreements for two of our anchor investors provide each such anchor investor with (i) the right to designate (prior to the consummation of a business combination) and the right to request the designation of (following the consummation of a business combination) one observer to our board of directors and (ii) the right to acquire, at the same price paid by, directly or indirectly, and on the same terms and conditions as, our founder, a number of founder shares equal to its pro rata share, based on its allocation of forward purchase shares, of five percent of the founder shares of any special purpose acquisition company sponsored by our founder for 10 years following the closing of our initial business combination, which we refer to as the new acquisition company. Further, such forward purchase agreements for the same two anchor investors provide such investors with the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  $63,000,000 in equity securities of the new acquisition company substantially similar to the forward purchase securities on the same or more favorable terms as new investors in such equity securities.


            The strategic partnership agreement provides that, so long as the Company remains a “blank check company” as such term is defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act and prior to our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors. In addition, on the date set for the shareholder vote to approve the initial business combination or on the business day immediately prior to the scheduled closing date of the initial business combination, if the BSOF Entities do not hold at least 4,000,000 Class A ordinary shares (which amount will be automatically reduced on a pro rata basis if we offer and sell fewer than 30,000,000 units in this offering, without regard to any exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option), the BSOF Entities will forfeit a pro rata number of their founder shares to our sponsor.

          The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial

          business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination. 
          
            Founder shares 
          

            As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,100,000 founder shares. Prior to the transfer of 525,000 founder shares to the BSOF Entities, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares, which were issued in exchange for a capital contribution of  $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In addition, in connection with the forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. If we decrease the size of this offering, or if the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option in full, our sponsor will forfeit an amount of Class B ordinary shares to maintain the ownership of our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of our sponsor’s founder shares), on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the sum of (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option) plus (ii) the number of founder shares held by our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of such founder shares) following such forfeiture. Up to 1,125,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised.


            In addition, 30% of the number of founder shares held by our sponsor, the BSOF Entities and their permitted transferees immediately following the consummation of this offering (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option), which we refer to as the “earnout shares,” will be subject to forfeiture on a pro rata basis by our sponsor and the BSOF Entities on the fifth anniversary of our initial business combination unless following our initial business combination, either (A) the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares (or any successor class of ordinary shares or common shares) equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share, and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period or (B) we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for consideration in cash, securities or other property which equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share, and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) (each, an “earnout condition”).

            number of earnout shares subject to forfeiture will initially be 2,250,000 (of which 157,500 are initially held by the BSOF Entities and 2,092,500 are initially held by our sponsor). In connection with the foregoing, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have also agreed to not transfer, assign or sell any of its earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which our sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares. See “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.”

          The founder shares are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering, except that:
          •
          only holders of the founder shares have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to our initial business combination;
          ​
          •
          the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below;
          ​

            •
            our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame). If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, other than the BSOF Entities, any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares (excluding 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors who is restricted from voting such shares as described below), we would need 9,621,876, or approximately 32.1%, of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming

          Pursuant to its forward purchase agreement, one of the anchor investors has waived its right to vote any of its 493,750 Class B ordinary shares on any matter for so long as such shares are held by such anchor investor or any of its controlled affiliates.
          •
          In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering. In connection with such letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed to transfer 240,000 founder shares to four of our independent directors (each receiving 60,000 shares) prior to the consummation of this offering. The letter agreement further provides that if any such director voluntarily resigns from or departs the board of directors, such director automatically forfeits all of the founder shares then owned by the director back to our sponsor.

            Transfer restrictions on founder shares 
          

            Our initial shareholders (other than our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the closing of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; and our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier of  (i) the third anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the waiver of the foregoing restriction by anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares (in either case, except as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). In addition, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied

            and (ii) the date on which our sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares. Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same applicable restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the “lock-up.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, the founder shares held by our initial shareholders (other than the earnout shares) will be released from the lock-up.


            In addition, we, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to certain transfer restrictions for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions. See “Underwriting.”

          
            Founder shares conversion and anti-dilution rights 
          

            The founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share. The Class B ordinary shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination at a ratio such that the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares, plus (ii) the sum of  (a) the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by us in connection with or in relation to the consummation of our initial business combination (including the forward purchase shares, but not the forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any warrants issued in a private placement to our founder or an affiliate of our founder upon conversion of working capital loans, minus (b) the number of public shares redeemed by public shareholders in connection with our initial business combination. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares, except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that the Class C ordinary shares may be converted into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis (i) at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or (ii) upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary shares to an unaffiliated third party. Any conversion of Class B ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares) described herein will take effect as a redemption of Class B ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares) and an issuance of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, as a matter of Cayman Islands law.

            Election of Directors; Voting Rights 
          
          Prior to our initial business combination, only holders of our founder shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors (subject to any contractual restrictions on voting). Holders of our public shares will not be entitled to vote on the election of directors during such time. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution passed by a majority of at least 90% of our ordinary shares voting in a general meeting. With respect to any other matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders, including any vote in connection with our initial business combination, except as required by law, holders of our founder shares and holders of our public shares will vote together as a single class, with each share entitling the holder to one vote. 
          
            Private placement warrants 
          

            Our anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which our founder has committed to purchase 2,006,041 (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option) and the BSOF Entities have committed to purchase 560,000 in the aggregate, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or one Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants will be nonredeemable and exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the anchor investors, the BSOF Entities or their respective permitted transferees (except as described below under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial anchor investors and the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. 

          
            Transfer restrictions on private placement warrants 
          

            The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, except as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.” In addition, we, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to certain transfer restrictions for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions. See “Underwriting.”

            Proceeds to be held in trust account 
          
          Of the proceeds we will receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, $300,000,000, or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit in either case), will be deposited into a segregated trust account located in the United States at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and $8,000,000 will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering (including a portion of the underwriting commissions) and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds to be placed in the trust account include $10,500,000 (or $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) in deferred underwriting commissions.
          Except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, as discussed below and subject to the requirements of law and regulation, provides that none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account until the earliest of  (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to the claims of our creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of our public shareholders. 
          
            Anticipated expenses and funding sources 
          
          Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, no proceeds held in the trust account will be available for our use, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $600,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. Unless and until we complete our initial business combination, we may pay our expenses only from:
          •
          the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account, which will be approximately $1,000,000 in working capital after the payment of approximately $1,000,000 in expenses relating to this offering (other than underwriting commissions); and

          obligation to advance funds or invest in us, and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. 
          
            Conditions to completing our initial business combination 
          
          NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board of directors is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
          We will complete our initial business combination only if the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, provided that in the event that the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the

          target businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. 
          
            Permitted purchases of public shares and public warrants by our affiliates 
          
          If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases of our securities” for a description of how our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction.
          The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the 
        
      
      
        23
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        
          number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
          
            Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination 
          

            We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. 

          
            Limitations on redemptions 
          
          Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

            Manner of conducting  redemptions 
          
          We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.
          If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will:
          •
          conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
          ​
          •
          file proxy materials with the SEC.
          ​

            If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, other than the BSOF Entities, any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares (excluding 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors who is restricted from voting such shares), we would need 9,621,876, or approximately 32.1%, of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days’ notice will be given of any such shareholder meeting. We 

        
      
      
        25
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        
          intend to give approximately 30 days, but not less than 10 days, nor more than 60 days, prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote will be taken to approve our initial business combination.
          If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
          •
          conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
          ​
          •
          file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
          ​
          Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, if we elect to conduct redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase our Class A ordinary shares in the open market, in order to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
          In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete such initial business combination. 
          
            Limitation on redemption rights of shareholders holding 20% or more of the public shares if we hold shareholder vote 
          
          Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a

          significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 20% of the public shares, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those shareholders that hold more than 20% of the public shares) for or against our initial business combination. 
          
            Release of funds in trust account on closing of our initial business combination 
          
          On the completion of our initial business combination, the funds held in the trust account will be used to pay amounts due to any public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights as described above under “Redemption rights for public shareholders upon completion of our initial business combination,” to pay the underwriters their deferred underwriting commissions, to pay all or a portion of the consideration payable to the target or owners of the target of our initial business combination and to pay other expenses associated with our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
          
            Redemption of public shares and distribution and liquidation if no initial business combination 
          
          Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that we will have only 24 months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination.
          If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will

            completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period.

          Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time frame.
          The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares.
          Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described above under “Limitations on redemptions.” For example, our board of directors may propose such an amendment if it determines that additional time is necessary to complete our initial business combination. In such event, we will conduct a proxy solicitation and distribute proxy materials pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act seeking shareholder approval of such proposal and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon shareholder approval of such amendment. 
          
            Limited payments to insiders 
          
          There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by us to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates (including our founder), for services rendered to us prior

          to or in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:
          •
          Repayment of up to an aggregate of  $200,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
          ​
          •
          Reimbursement for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to us by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month;
          ​
          •
          Reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination; and
          ​
          •
          Repayment of loans which may be made by our founder or an affiliate of our founder to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. 
          ​
          
            Audit Committee 
          
          We will establish and maintain an audit committee, which will be composed entirely of independent directors. Among its responsibilities, the audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates and monitor compliance with the other terms relating to this offering. If any noncompliance is identified, then the audit committee will be charged with the responsibility to promptly take all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise to cause compliance with the terms of this offering. For more information, see the section entitled “Management — Committees of the Board of Directors — Audit Committee.”
          Risks 
          We are a newly formed company that has conducted no operations and has generated no revenues. Until we complete our initial business combination, we will have no operations and will generate no operating revenues. In making your decision whether to invest in our securities, you should take into account not only the background of our management team, but also the special risks we face as a blank check company. This offering is not being conducted in compliance with Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. Accordingly, you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors in Rule 419 blank check offerings. For additional information concerning how Rule 419 blank check offerings differ from this offering, please see “Proposed Business — Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.” You should carefully consider these and the other risks set forth in the section entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32 of this prospectus.

          The “actual” calculation includes 8,625,000 founder shares held by our sponsor as of the date of this prospectus. The “as adjusted” calculation includes the 3,750,000 founder shares to be issued to the anchor investors in private placements prior to this offering in connection with the forward purchase agreements. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor, including restrictions on the ability to redeem such shares.

          The “as adjusted” information gives effect to the sale of the units in this offering, the sale of the private placement warrants, repayment of up to an aggregate of  $200,000 in loans made to us by our sponsor and the payment of the estimated expenses of this offering and assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and the forfeiture by our sponsor of 1,125,000 founder shares. The “as adjusted” information excludes gross proceeds of approximately $150,000,000 from the sale of forward purchase shares to close concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination.

Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us in which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months.

        Risk Factors
        An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before making a decision to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 
        We are a recently formed company with no operating history and no revenues, and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. 
        We are a recently formed company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with no operating results, and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. 
        Our shareholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed initial business combination, which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our shareholders do not support such a combination. 
        We may choose not to hold a shareholder vote before we complete our initial business combination if the business combination would not require shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Except for as required by applicable law or stock exchange requirement, the decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our ordinary shares do not approve of the business combination we complete. Please see the section entitled “Proposed Business — Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination” for additional information. 
        Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash. 
        At the time of your investment in us, you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more target businesses. Since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking shareholder approval, public shareholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination, unless we seek such shareholder vote. Accordingly, your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public shareholders in which we describe our initial business combination. 

          If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders (other than the BSOF Entities with respect to any of their public shares, if any) and management team have agreed to vote in favor of such initial business combination, regardless of how our public shareholders vote. 


          Our initial shareholders will own, on an as-converted basis, approximately 26.4% of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares immediately following the consummation of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering and the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares). Our initial shareholders and management team also may from time to time purchase Class A ordinary shares prior to our initial business combination; however, the BSOF Entities are not required to vote any of their public shares acquired from time to time in favor of our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          that, if we seek shareholder approval of an initial business combination, such initial business combination will be approved if we receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at such meeting, including the founder shares. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares (excluding 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors who is restricted from voting such shares), we would need 9,621,876, or approximately 32.1%, of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). Accordingly, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial shareholders (other than the BSOF Entities with respect to any of their public shares, if any) and management team to vote in favor of our initial business combination will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite shareholder approval for such initial business combination. 

        In evaluating a prospective target business for our initial business combination, our management will rely on the availability of all of the funds from the sale of the forward purchase shares to be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination. If the sale of some or all of the forward purchase shares fails to close, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination. 

          We have entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 forward purchase shares plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants for a purchase price of  $10.00 per forward purchase share, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close concurrently with our initial business combination. The funds from the sale of forward purchase shares may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. The obligations under the forward purchase agreements do not depend on whether any public shareholders elect to redeem their shares and provide us with a minimum funding level for the initial business combination. However, if the sale of the forward purchase shares does not close for any reason, including by reason of the failure by some or all of the anchor investors to fund the purchase price for their forward purchase shares, for example, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination. Further, the forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. If we fail to obtain such approval, we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination. Additionally, the anchor investors’ obligations to purchase the forward purchase shares are subject to termination prior to the closing of the sale of the forward purchase shares by mutual written consent of the company and each anchor investor, or, automatically: (i) if this offering is not consummated on or prior to May 5, 2018; (ii) if the gross proceeds from this offering do not equal or exceed $200,000,000; (iii) if our initial business combination is not consummated within 24 months from the closing of this offering; (iv) upon the death of Mr. Asali; (v) if Mr. Asali, our sponsor or the Company becomes subject to any voluntary or involuntary petition under the United States federal bankruptcy laws or any state insolvency law, in each case which is not withdrawn within sixty (60) days after being filed, or a receiver, fiscal agent or similar officer is appointed by a court for business or property of Mr. Asali, our sponsor or the company, in each case which is not removed, withdrawn or terminated within sixty (60) days after such appointment; or (vi) if Mr. Asali is indicted and/or convicted in a criminal proceeding for a crime involving fraud or dishonesty. The anchor investors’ obligations to purchase their forward purchase shares are subject to fulfillment of customary closing conditions, including the following: (i) our initial business combination must be consummated substantially concurrently with, and immediately following, the purchase of forward purchase shares; and (ii) the company must have delivered to the anchor investors a certificate evidencing the company’s good standing as a Cayman Islands exempted company, as of a date within ten (10) business days of the closing of the sale of forward purchase shares. In the event of any such failure to fund by an anchor investor, any obligation is so terminated or any such condition is not satisfied and not waived by an anchor investor, we may not be able to obtain additional funds to account for such shortfall on terms favorable to us or at all. Any such shortfall would also reduce the amount of funds that we have available for working capital of the post-business combination company. While each anchor investor has represented to us that it has sufficient funds to satisfy its obligations under the respective forward purchase agreements, we have not obligated the anchor investors to reserve funds for such obligations.

          If the anchor investors or the BSOF Entities purchase large amounts of public shares in the open market, they may attempt to leverage their redemption rights in order to affect the outcome of a potential initial business combination. 


          The anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own, subject to the limitation that under the Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of Exchange Act), is restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the public shares, without the prior consent of the Company. If management proposes an initial business combination that some or all of the anchor investors or the BSOF Entities are not in favor, such anchor investors or BSOF Entities may decide to purchase public shares in the open market and seek to leverage their redemption rights to influence whether such business combination is consummated. This could result in our having to negotiate for more favorable terms for the anchor investors, which could jeopardize our ability to successfully consummate an initial business combination. See “— In evaluating a prospective target business for our initial business combination, our management will rely on the availability of all of the funds from the sale of the forward purchase shares to be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination. If the sale of some or all of the forward purchase shares fails to close, we may lack sufficient funds to consummate our initial business combination.” 

        The ability of our public shareholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target. 
        We may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us. 
        The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure. 
        At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will not know how many shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing. Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the amount held in trust will continue to reflect our obligation to pay the entire deferred underwriting commissions.

        The ability of our public shareholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your shares. 
        If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the probability that our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate liquidity, you could attempt to sell your shares in the open market; however, at such time our shares may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your shares in the open market. 
        The requirement that we complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may limit the time we have in which to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial business combination on terms that would produce value for our shareholders. 
        Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition, we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation. 
        We may not be able to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate. 

          We may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering. Our ability to complete our initial business combination may be negatively impacted by general market conditions, volatility in the capital and debt markets and the other risks described herein. If we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. 

        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or public warrants from public shareholders, which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares. 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, other than as

        expressly stated herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. 
        In the event that our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. See “Proposed Business — Permitted purchases of our securities” for a description of how our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase securities from in any private transaction. 
        In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
        If a shareholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial business combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares, such shares may not be redeemed. 
        We will comply with the proxy rules or tender offer rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial business combination. Despite our compliance with these rules, if a shareholder fails to receive our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, such shareholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly redeem or tender public shares. In the event that a shareholder fails to comply with these procedures, its shares may not be redeemed. See “Proposed Business — Business Strategy — Tendering share certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights.” 
        You will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account, except under certain limited circumstances. Therefore, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. 
        Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described herein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the trust account with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate your investment, you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.

        The NYSE may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
        We have applied to have our units listed on the NYSE on or promptly after the date of this prospectus and our Class A ordinary shares and warrants on or promptly after their date of separation. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on the NYSE. Although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet, on a pro forma basis, the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the NYSE listing standards, we cannot assure you that our securities will be, or will continue to be, listed on the NYSE in the future or prior to our initial business combination. In order to continue listing our securities on the NYSE prior to our initial business combination, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and share price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum average global market capitalization (generally $50,000,000) and a minimum number of holders of our securities (generally 300 shareholders and 100 public warrant holders). 
        Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with the NYSE’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than the NYSE’s continued listing requirements, in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on the NYSE. For instance, our share price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. 
        If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
        •
        a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
        ​
        •
        reduced liquidity for our securities; 
        ​
        •
        a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a “penny stock” which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 
        ​
        •
        a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
        ​
        •
        a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
        ​
        The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as “covered securities.” Because we expect that our units and eventually our Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on the NYSE, our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants will qualify as covered securities under the statute. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on the NYSE, our securities would not qualify as covered securities under the statute and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. 
        You will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies. 
        Since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securities laws. However, because we will have net tangible assets in excess of  $5,000,000 upon the completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will be immediately tradable and we will have a 
      
      
        37
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if this offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination. For a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, please see “Proposed Business —  Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419.” 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if you or a “group” of shareholders are deemed to hold in excess of 20% of the public shares, you will lose the ability to redeem all such shares in excess of 20% of the public shares. 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally, you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And as a result, you will continue to hold the Excess Shares and, in order to dispose of such Excess Shares, would be required to sell your Excess Shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 
        Because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        We expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships), other blank check companies and other entities, domestic and international, competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries, including consumer products or services or food and beverage business, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services businesses. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, we are obligated to offer holders of our public shares the right to redeem their shares for cash at the time of our initial business combination in conjunction with a shareholder vote or via a tender offer. Target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. Any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may receive only their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        If the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24 months, it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination, and we will depend on loans from our founder or an affiliate of our founder to fund our search and to complete our initial business combination. 
        Of the net proceeds of this offering, only $1,000,000 will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our working capital requirements. We believe that, upon closing of this offering, the funds 
      
      
        38
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24 months; however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise), we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. 
        In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. The amount held in the trust account will not be impacted as a result of such increase or decrease. If we are required to seek additional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our founder, his affiliates, our management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Neither our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founder or an affiliate of our founder as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our public shareholders may only receive an estimated $10.00 per share, or possibly less, on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        Subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. 
        Even if we conduct due diligence on a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues with a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining post-combination debt financing. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission.

        If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.00 per share. 
        Our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. 
        Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed timeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public shareholders could be less than the $10.00 per public share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement the form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
        Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders. 
        In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of  (i) $10.00 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public shareholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share. 
        We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnification claims of our directors and executive officers. 
        We have agreed to indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account and to not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if  (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. Our obligation to indemnify our officers and directors may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
        If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors, thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages. 
        If, after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. 
        If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our shareholders and the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 
        If, before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public shareholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our shareholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. 
        If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. 
        If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, our activities may be restricted, including: 
        •
        restrictions on the nature of our investments; and 
        ​
        •
        restrictions on the issuance of securities, 
        ​
        each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including:

        •
        adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and

        reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. 
        ​
        In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of our assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor. 
        We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. This offering is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering; or (iii) absent an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations. 
        We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations. 

          If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, our public shareholders may be forced to wait beyond such 24 months before redemption from our trust account. 

        If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the proceeds then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of

        interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), will be used to fund the redemption of our public shares, as further described herein. Any redemption of public shareholders from the trust account will be effected automatically by function of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association prior to any voluntary winding up. If we are required to wind-up, liquidate the trust account and distribute such amount therein, pro rata, to our public shareholders, as part of any liquidation process, such winding up, liquidation and distribution must comply with the applicable provisions of the Companies Law. In that case, investors may be forced to wait beyond 24 months from the closing of this offering before the redemption proceeds of our trust account become available to them, and they receive the return of their pro rata portion of the proceeds from our trust account. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to the date of our redemption or liquidation unless we consummate our initial business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem their Class A ordinary shares. Only upon our redemption or any liquidation will public shareholders be entitled to distributions if we are unable to complete our initial business combination. 
        Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. 
        If we are forced to enter into an insolvent liquidation, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed as an unlawful payment if it was proved that immediately following the date on which the distribution was made, we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. As a result, a liquidator could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to us or our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing themselves and our company to claims, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. We and our directors and officers who knowingly and willfully authorized or permitted any distribution to be paid out of our share premium account while we were unable to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business would be guilty of an offence and may be liable to a fine of  $18,292.68 and to imprisonment for five years in the Cayman Islands. 
        We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial business combination. 
        We will not hold our first annual meeting until after our first fiscal year. There is no requirement under the Companies Law for us to hold annual or general meetings to elect directors. Until we hold an annual meeting of shareholders, public shareholders may not be afforded the opportunity to elect directors and to discuss company affairs with management. Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of shareholders) serving a three-year term. 
        We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time, and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless. 
        We are not registering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the Securities Act or any state securities laws at this time. However, under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering such shares and maintain a current prospectus relating to the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However, no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise 
      
      
        43
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, unless an exemption is available. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws. If the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the Class A ordinary shares included in the units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 
        The grant of registration rights to our initial shareholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. 

          Pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into concurrently with the closing of this offering, the holders of the private placement warrants, the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans, and the founder shares will be entitled to registration rights with respect to such warrants and the ordinary shares underlying such warrants and founder shares. The registration rights will be exercisable with respect to the founder shares, the private placement warrants (including any Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of such private placement warrants) and the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans (including any Class A ordinary shares that may be issued upon the exercise of such warrants). Pursuant to the forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement, we have agreed that we will use our reasonable best efforts (i) to file within 30 days after the closing of the initial business combination (and, with respect to clause (B) below, within 30 days following announcement of the results of the shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination or the results of our offer to shareholders to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination (whichever is later), which we refer to as the “disclosure date”) a registration statement with the SEC for a secondary offering of (A) the forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and the BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, including any time after we complete our initial business combination, (ii) to cause such registration statement to be declared effective promptly thereafter, but in no event later than 60 days after the closing of the initial business combination or the disclosure date, as the case may be and (iii) to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the earliest of  (A) the date on which the anchor investor or BSOF Entity ceases to hold the securities covered thereby and (B) the date all of the securities covered thereby can be sold publicly without restriction or limitation under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) under the Securities Act, subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude. This is because the shareholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares that is expected when the securities owned by our initial shareholders or their respective permitted transferees are registered. 

        Because we are neither limited to evaluating a target business in a particular industry sector nor have we identified any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations. 
        We will seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in the consumer products or services or food and beverage industries, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services industries, but may also pursue business combination opportunities in other sectors, except that we will not, under our

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations. Because we have not yet identified or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination, there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we complete our initial business combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. For example, if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following our initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 
        We may seek acquisition opportunities in industries outside of the consumer products or services or food and beverage industries, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services industries (which industries may or may not be outside of our management’s areas of expertise). 
        Although we intend to focus on identifying business combination candidates in the consumer products or services or food and beverage sectors, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services sectors, we will consider a business combination outside of these industries if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an attractive acquisition opportunity for our company or we are unable to identify a suitable candidate in the consumer products or services or food and beverage industries, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services industries, after having expended a reasonable amount of time and effort in an attempt to do so. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate, we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in a business combination candidate. In the event we elect to pursue an investment outside of the consumer products or services or food and beverage industries, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services industries, our management’s expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation, and the information contained herein regarding the consumer products or services or food and beverage industries, or adjacent manufacturing or industrial services industries, would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire. 
        Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. 
        Although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of shareholders may exercise their redemption rights, which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        In addition, if shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain shareholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        We are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting or investment banking firm, and consequently, you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. 
        Unless we complete our initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA that the price we are paying is fair to our shareholders from a financial point of view. If no opinion is obtained, our shareholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, related to our initial business combination. 
        We will not be required to obtain a fairness opinion from an independent investment banking firm as to the fair market value of the target business if our board of directors is able to determine independently the fair market value of the target business. 
        The fair market value of a target business or businesses will be determined by our board of directors based upon standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as actual and potential sales, the values of comparable businesses, earnings and cash flow, and book value. If, however, our board of directors is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis our board, and our board of directors is not able to determine independently that the target business has a sufficient fair market value to meet the threshold criterion, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criterion. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to you. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
        However, in all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain a fairness opinion. As a result, if no opinion is obtained or an opinion is not delivered to you, our shareholders will be relying solely on the judgment of our board in effecting our initial business combination. 

          We may issue additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares upon the conversion of the founder shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions contained therein. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our shareholders and likely present other risks. 


          Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share, 200,000,000 Class C ordinary shares, par value $0.0001, and 1,000,000 preference shares, $0.0001 per share. Immediately after this offering, there will be 170,000,000 and 13,750,000 (assuming in each case that the underwriters have not exercised their over-allotment option) authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares, respectively, available for issuance which amount does not take into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and

          the forward purchase warrants, shares issuable upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares or shares issued upon the sale of the forward purchase shares. The Class B ordinary shares are automatically convertible into Class A ordinary shares at the time of our initial business combination unless the holder elects to have such shares converted into Class C ordinary shares, as described herein. The Class C ordinary shares are convertible into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis (i) at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or (ii) upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary share to an unaffiliated third party. Immediately after this offering, there will be no Class A ordinary shares or preference shares issued and outstanding. 


          We may issue a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or preference shares to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination. We may also issue Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares at a ratio greater than one-to-one at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the anti-dilution provisions as set forth herein. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. The issuance of additional ordinary or preference shares: 

        •
        may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering; 
        ​

          •
          may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 
          ​

        •
        could cause a change in control if a substantial number of Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and

        may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units, Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. 
        ​

          Unlike most other similarly structured blank check companies, our initial shareholders will receive additional Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination. 

        The founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option), plus (ii) the sum of  (a) the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by us in connection with or in relation to the consummation of our initial business combination (including the forward purchase shares, but not the forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any warrants issued in a private placement to our founder or an affiliate of our founder upon conversion of working capital loans, minus (b) the number of public shares redeemed by public shareholders in connection with our initial business combination. This is different than most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of 20% of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination.

        Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        We anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 
        We may be a passive foreign investment company, or “PFIC,” which could result in adverse United States federal income tax consequences to U.S. investors. 

          If we are a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder (as defined in the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — General”) of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants, the U.S. Holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences and may be subject to additional reporting requirements. Our PFIC status for our current and subsequent taxable years may depend on whether we qualify for the PFIC start-up exception (see the section of this prospectus captioned ‘‘Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — U.S. Holders — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules’’). Depending on the particular circumstances the application of the start-up exception may be subject to uncertainty, and there cannot be any assurance that we will qualify for the start-up exception. Accordingly, there can be no assurances with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year. Our actual PFIC status for any taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Moreover, if we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year (of which there can be no assurance), we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a “qualified electing fund” election, but there can be no assurance that we will timely provide such required information, and such election would be unavailable with respect to our warrants in all cases. We urge U.S. investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible application of the PFIC rules. For a more detailed explanation of the tax consequences of PFIC classification to U.S. Holders, see the section of this prospectus captioned “Taxation — United States Federal Income Tax Considerations — U.S. Holders — Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.” 

        We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination and such reincorporation may result in taxes imposed on shareholders. 
        We may, in connection with our initial business combination and subject to requisite shareholder approval under the Companies Law, reincorporate in the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located or in another jurisdiction. The transaction may require a shareholder to recognize taxable income in the jurisdiction in which the shareholder is a tax resident or in which its members are resident if it is a tax transparent entity. We do not intend to make any cash distributions to shareholders to pay such taxes. Shareholders may be subject to withholding taxes or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after the reincorporation. 
        After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights. 
        It is possible that after our initial business combination, a majority of our directors and officers will reside outside of the United States and all of our assets will be located outside of the United States. As a

        result, it may be difficult, or in some cases not possible, for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon us or any of our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties on our directors and officers under United States laws, including federal securities laws. See “Description of Securities — Certain Differences in Corporate Law — Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.” 
        We are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their loss could adversely affect our ability to operate. 
        Our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. Other than key-man insurance on the life of Mr. Asali that we are required to obtain under the terms of the forward purchase agreements, we do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. 
        Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom may join us following our initial business combination. The loss of key personnel, and restrictions in the forward purchase agreements on hiring certain employees related to our sponsor, could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 

          Our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our initial business combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. In addition, certain terms of the forward purchase agreements may limit the hiring of individuals affiliated with our sponsor by us and/or the target business in connection with or following an initial business combination. For example, unless we obtain approval of anchor investors that have committed to purchase more than 50% of the total forward purchase shares we will not be permitted to pay any transaction, monitoring or similar fee to our sponsor or any of its’ employees, directors or controlled affiliates. We must also obtain approval from a majority of our anchor investors prior to hiring, employing or appointing to our board of directors any employee, officer or director of our sponsor. 

        Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination, and a particular business combination may be conditioned on the retention or resignation of such key personnel. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our initial business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous. 
        Our key personnel may be able to remain with our company after the completion of our initial business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination. Such negotiations also could make such key personnel’s retention or resignation a condition to any such agreement. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.

        We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. 
        When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business’s management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target business’s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target business’s management not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any shareholders who choose to remain shareholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such shareholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. 
        The officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination. The loss of a business combination target’s key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post-combination business. 
        The role of an acquisition candidate’s key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidate’s management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination, it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place. 
        Our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. 
        Our executive officers and directors are not required to, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses. Our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs. Our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. If our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination. For a complete discussion of our executive officers’ and directors’ other business affairs, please see “Management — Officers and Directors.” 
        Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. 

          Following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Certain of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. 

        For a complete discussion of our executive officers’ and directors’ business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, please see “Management — Officers and Directors,” “Management — Conflicts of Interest” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

        Our executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. 
        We have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our executive officers, although we do not intend to do so. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. 
        The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination. Consequently, our directors’ and officers’ discretion in identifying and selecting a suitable target business may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our shareholders’ best interest. If this were the case, it would be a breach of their fiduciary duties to us as a matter of Cayman Islands law and we or our shareholders might have a claim against such individuals for infringing on our shareholders’ rights. See the section titled “Description of Securities — Certain Differences in Corporate Law — Shareholder Suits” for further information on the ability to bring such claims. However, we might not ultimately be successful in any claim we may make against them for such reason. 
        We may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. 
        In light of the involvement of our sponsor, executive officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, including, without limitation, those described under “Management — Conflicts of Interest.” Such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities. Our sponsor, officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated, and there have been no substantive discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination as set forth in “Proposed Business — Effecting our initial business combination — Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination” and such transaction was approved by a majority of our independent and disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers, directors or existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public shareholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. 

          Since our sponsor, the anchor investors (including our founder and each of our other executive officers), the BSOF Entities and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our initial business combination is not completed (other than with respect to public shares they may acquire during or after this offering), a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination. 


          As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,100,000 founder shares. Prior to the transfer of 525,000 founder shares to the BSOF Entities, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares, which were issued in exchange for a capital contribution of  $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of  $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. Pursuant to a letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed to transfer an aggregate of 240,000 founder shares to our independent

          directors (each receiving 60,000 shares) prior to the consummation of this offering. In addition, in connection with the forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors (including our founder and each of our other executive officers) an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. In addition, such anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which our founder has committed to purchase 2,006,041 (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option) and the BSOF Entities have committed to purchase 560,000 in the aggregate, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Further, 2,250,000 founder shares, which constitute the earnout shares, will be subject to forfeiture by our sponsor (or its permitted transferees) and the BSOF Entities on the fifth anniversary of our initial business combination unless following our initial business combination, either (A) the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares (or any successor class of ordinary shares or common shares) equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share and, in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period or (B) we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for consideration in cash, securities or other property which equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share and, in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like). See “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.” The personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination. This risk may become more acute as the 24-month anniversary of the closing of this offering nears, which is the deadline for our completion of an initial business combination. 

        We may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, to complete a business combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our shareholders’ investment in us. 
        Although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities, or to otherwise incur outstanding debt following this offering, we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our initial business combination. We and our officers have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account. As such, no issuance of debt will affect the per share amount available for redemption from the trust account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including: 
        •
        default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
        ​
        •
        acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
        ​
        •
        our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 
        ​
        •
        our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
        ​
        •
        our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares;

        We may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and forward purchase shares, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services. This lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability. 
        The net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and forward purchase shares will provide us with $440,500,000 (or $483,925,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) (after deducting payment of offering expenses of approximately $1,000,000 and underwriting commissions of  $16,500,000, or $18,975,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) that we may use to complete our initial business combination. 
        We may effectuate our initial business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However, we may not be able to effectuate our initial business combination with more than one target business because of various factors, including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be: 
        •
        solely dependent upon the performance of a single business, property or asset; or 
        ​
        •
        dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
        ​
        This lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial business combination. 
        We may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. 
        If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete our initial business combination. With multiple business combinations, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        We may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. 
        In pursuing our acquisition strategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company. By definition, very little public information generally exists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. 
        Our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. 
        We may structure our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to our initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new Class A ordinary shares, our shareholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority shareholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company’s shares than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain control of the target business. 
        We do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete our initial business combination with which a substantial majority of our shareholders do not agree. 
        Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association do not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold, except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (such that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). As a result, we may be able to complete our initial business combination even though a substantial majority of our public shareholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares or, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead may search for an alternate business combination. 
        In order to effectuate an initial business combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments, including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our shareholders may not support.

          agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination, increased redemption thresholds, changed industry focus and, with respect to their warrants, amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. Amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will require a special resolution of our shareholders as a matter of Cayman Islands law, meaning the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and amending our warrant agreement will require a vote of holders of at least 65% of the public warrants. In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association requires us to provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash if we propose an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an initial business combination within 24 months of the closing of this offering. To the extent any of such amendments would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any of the securities offered through this registration statement, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. 

        The provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to our pre-business combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account) may be amended with the approval of holders of not less than two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our shareholders may not support. 
        Some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions, including those which relate to a company’s pre-business combination activity, without approval by a certain percentage of the company’s shareholders. In those companies, amendment of these provisions typically requires approval by between 90% and 100% of the company’s public shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that any of its provisions related to pre-business combination activity (including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public shareholders as described herein) may be amended if approved by special resolution, meaning holders of not less than two-thirds of our ordinary shares who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company, and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our ordinary shares. Our initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own, on an as-converted basis, approximately 26.4% of our Class A ordinary shares upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering and the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and/or trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which govern our pre-business combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree. Our shareholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. 
        Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to agreements with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Our shareholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        agreements and, as a result, will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor, executive officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, in the event of a breach, our shareholders would need to pursue a shareholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. 
        We may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. 

          Although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and forward purchase shares will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination, because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction. If the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and forward purchase shares prove to be insufficient, either because of the size of our initial business combination, the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business, the obligation to redeem for cash a significant number of shares from shareholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination, we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination. We cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The recent economic environment has made it difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders, and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete our initial business combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers, directors or shareholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial business combination. 

        Our initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. 

          Upon closing of this offering, our initial shareholders will own, on an as-converted basis, 26.4% of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering and the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares). Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a shareholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. If our initial shareholders purchase any units in this offering or if our initial shareholders purchase any additional Class A ordinary shares in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control. To our knowledge, none of our officers or directors, has any current intention to purchase additional securities, other than as disclosed in this prospectus. Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our Class A ordinary shares.

        Our sponsor contributed $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per founder share, and the anchor investors contributed $37,500, or approximately $0.01 per share, and, accordingly, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our Class A ordinary shares. 
        The difference between the public offering price per share (allocating all of the unit purchase price to the Class A ordinary share and none to the warrant included in the unit) and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A ordinary shares after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering. Our sponsor and the anchor investors acquired the founder shares at a 
      
      
        56
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        nominal price, significantly contributing to this dilution. Upon closing of this offering, and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants included in the units, you and the other public shareholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately 96.1%, or $9.61 per share (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option), the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share of  $0.39 and the initial offering price of  $10.00 per unit. This dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the founder shares result in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the founder shares at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public shareholders seek redemptions from the trust for their public shares. In addition, because of the anti-dilution protection in the founder shares, any equity or equity-linked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our Class A ordinary shares. 

          We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants and forward purchase warrants. As a result, the exercise price of your warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened and the number of our Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without your approval. 


          Our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants and forward purchase warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants and forward purchase warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consent of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants and forward purchase warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, among other things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash, shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of Class A ordinary shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. 

        We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless. 

          We have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of  $0.01 per warrant, provided that the closing price of our public shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period ending on the third trading day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the date we give notice of redemption. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you to (i) exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants. None of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the anchor investors, the BSOF Entities or their respective permitted transferees. 

        Our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A ordinary shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial business combination. 
        We will be issuing warrants to purchase 15,000,000 of our Class A ordinary shares (or up to 17,250,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) as part of the units offered by this prospectus and, simultaneously with the closing of this offering, we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or one 
      
      
        57
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          Class C ordinary share, as applicable, at $11.50 per share. We will also issue 5,000,000 forward purchase warrants concurrently with the closing of the sale of the forward purchase shares. In addition, if our founder or an affiliate of our founder makes any working capital loans, he or it may convert those loans into up to an additional 1,500,000 private placement warrants, at the price of  $1.00 per warrant. To the extent we issue ordinary shares to effectuate a business transaction, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares (which are convertible into Class A ordinary shares) upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares and reduce the value of the Class A ordinary shares issued to complete the business transaction. Therefore, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. 

        Because each unit contains one-half of one warrant and only a whole warrant may be exercised, the units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. 
        Each unit contains one-half of one warrant. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, no fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units, and only whole units will trade. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder. This is different from other offerings similar to ours whose units include one ordinary share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We have established the components of the units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of a business combination since the warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for half of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a whole warrant to purchase one share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unit structure may cause our units to be worth less than if it included a warrant to purchase one whole share. 
        The determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry. You may have less assurance, therefore, that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company. 
        Prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriters. In determining the size of this offering, management held customary organizational meetings with representatives of the underwriters, both prior to our inception and thereafter, with respect to the state of capital markets, generally, and the amount the underwriters believed they reasonably could raise on our behalf. Factors considered in determining the size of this offering, prices and terms of the units, including the Class A ordinary shares and warrants underlying the units, include: 
        •
        the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies; 
        ​
        •
        prior offerings of those companies; 
        ​
        •
        our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values; 
        ​
        •
        a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions; 
        ​
        •
        our capital structure; 
        ​
        •
        an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies; 
        ​
        •
        general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering; and 
        ​
        •
        other factors as were deemed relevant. 
        ​
        Although these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results.

        There is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities. 
        There is currently no market for our securities. Shareholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision. Following this offering, the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for our securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained. 
        Because we must furnish our shareholders with target business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses. 
        The federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financing reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. 
        We are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. 
        We are an “emerging growth company” within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Class A ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
        Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private 
      
      
        59
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used. 
        Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate a business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition. 
        Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2018. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target business with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
        Because we are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, you may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through the U.S. Federal courts may be limited. 
        We are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon our directors or executive officers, or enforce judgments obtained in the United States courts against our directors or officers. 
        Our corporate affairs will be governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (as the same may be supplemented or amended from time to time) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. We will also be subject to the federal securities laws of the United States. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority, but are not binding on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are different from what they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and certain states, such as Delaware, may have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholders derivative action in a Federal court of the United States. 
        We have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be (i) in respect of taxes, a fine or penalty, (ii) inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, (iii) impeachable on the 
      
      
        60
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        grounds of fraud or (iv) obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. 
        As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a United States company. 
        Provisions in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Class A ordinary shares and could entrench management. 

          Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preference shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. In addition, public shareholders are restricted from redeeming their Class A ordinary shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares. See “— If the anchor investors purchase large amounts of public shares in the open market, they may attempt to leverage their redemption rights in order to affect the outcome of a potential initial business combination.” 

        Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 
        We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss. 
        Risks Associated with Acquiring and Operating a Business in Foreign Countries 
        If we pursue a target company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we may face additional burdens in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing such initial business combination, and if we effect such initial business combination, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. 
        If we pursue a target a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States for our initial business combination, we would be subject to risks associated with cross-border business combinations, including in connection with investigating, agreeing to and completing our initial business combination, conducting due diligence in a foreign jurisdiction, having such transaction approved by any local governments, regulators or agencies and changes in the purchase price based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. 
        If we effect our initial business combination with such a company, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following: 
        •
        costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-border business operations; 
        ​
        •
        rules and regulations regarding currency redemption;

        We may not be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, we may be unable to complete such initial business combination, or, if we complete such combination, our operations might suffer, either of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
        If our management following our initial business combination is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws, which could lead to various regulatory issues. 
        Following our initial business combination, our management may resign from their positions as officers or directors of the company and the management of the target business at the time of the business combination will remain in place. Management of the target business may not be familiar with United States securities laws. If new management is unfamiliar with United States securities laws, they may have to expend time and resources becoming familiar with such laws. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations. 
        After our initial business combination, substantially all of our assets may be located in a foreign country and substantially all of our revenue will be derived from our operations in such country. Accordingly, our results of operations and prospects will be subject, to a significant extent, to the economic, political and legal policies, developments and conditions in the country in which we operate. 
        The economic, political and social conditions, as well as government policies, of the country in which our operations are located could affect our business. Economic growth could be uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy and such growth may not be sustained in the future. If in the future such country’s economy experiences a downturn or grows at a slower rate than

        expected, there may be less demand for spending in certain industries. A decrease in demand for spending in certain industries could materially and adversely affect our ability to find an attractive target business with which to consummate our initial business combination and if we effect our initial business combination, the ability of that target business to become profitable. 
        Exchange rate fluctuations and currency policies may cause a target business’ ability to succeed in the international markets to be diminished. 
        In the event we acquire a non-U.S. target, all revenues and income would likely be received in a foreign currency, and the dollar equivalent of our net assets and distributions, if any, could be adversely affected by reductions in the value of the local currency. The value of the currencies in our target regions fluctuate and are affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions. Any change in the relative value of such currency against our reporting currency may affect the attractiveness of any target business or, following consummation of our initial business combination, our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if a currency appreciates in value against the dollar prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, the cost of a target business as measured in dollars will increase, which may make it less likely that we are able to consummate such transaction. 
        We may reincorporate in another jurisdiction in connection with our initial business combination, and the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights. 
        In connection with our initial business combination, we may relocate the home jurisdiction of our business from the Cayman Islands to another jurisdiction. If we determine to do this, the laws of such jurisdiction may govern some or all of our future material agreements. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital.

        CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
        Some of the statements contained in this prospectus may constitute “forward-looking statements” for purposes of the federal securities laws. Our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our or our management team’s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future.

The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intends,” “may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this prospectus may include, for example, statements about: 
        •
        our ability to complete our initial business combination; 
        ​
        •

        •
        the proceeds of the forward purchase shares being available to us; 
        ​

        •
        our public securities’ potential liquidity and trading; 
        ​
        •
        the lack of a market for our securities; 
        ​
        •
        the use of proceeds not held in the trust account or available to us from interest income on the trust account balance; 
        ​
        •
        the trust account not being subject to claims of third parties; or 
        ​
        •
        our financial performance following this offering.

        The forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described under the heading “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.

        of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that have been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. 
        (3)
        The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, $10,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. See “Underwriting” beginning on page 32. The remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. 
        ​
        (4)
        These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust account. 
        ​
        (5)
        Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for financing. 
        ​
        Of the $308.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $353.9 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $300.0 million ($10.00 per unit), or $345.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $8.0 million, or up to $8.9 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Prior to such time, such proceeds will not be invested and will be held in a non-interest bearing trust account. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account following the investment of such funds will be approximately $600,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, until the earliest of  (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes. 
        The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. 
        We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our founder or an affiliate of our founder, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. 
        We will reimburse our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 

          Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of the date of this prospectus, we have borrowed $91,993 under the promissory note with our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses. 

        In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founder or an affiliate of our founder may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founder or an affiliate of our founder as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
        Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants for a purchase price of  $10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares purchased, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close concurrently with our initial business combination. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. In connection with these agreements, we also issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants, except that, pursuant to the applicable forward purchase agreement, one of the anchor investors will receive forward purchase warrants exercisable only for Class C ordinary shares.


          The forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement also provide that the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities are entitled to (i) a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans from our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) by us, including for capital raising purposes, or if we offer or seek commitments for any equity or equity-linked security to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than the units we are offering by this prospectus and their component public shares and warrants, the founder shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for which such founder shares are convertible), the forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants and the private placement warrants, and any securities issued by us as consideration to any seller in our initial business combination and warrants issued upon the conversion of working capital loans to us made by our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) and (ii) registration rights with respect to (A) the forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors, including any time after we complete our initial business combination.


          In addition, the forward purchase agreements for two of our anchor investors provide each such anchor investor with (i) the right to designate (prior to the consummation of a Business Combination) and the right to request the designation of  (following the consummation of a Business Combination) one observer to our board of directors and (ii) the right to acquire, at the same price paid by, directly or indirectly, and on the same terms and conditions as, our founder, a number of founder shares equal to its pro rata share, based on its allocation of forward purchase shares, of five percent of the founder shares of any special purpose acquisition company sponsored by our founder for 10 years following the closing of our initial business combination, which we refer to as the new acquisition company. Further, such forward purchase agreements for the same two anchor investors provide such investors with the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  $63,000,000 in equity securities of the new acquisition company substantially similar to the forward purchase securities on the same or more favorable terms as new investors in such equity securities.


          The strategic partnership agreement provides that, so long as the Company remains a “blank check company” as such term is defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act and prior to our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors.

        The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders and are intended to provide us with minimum funding level for our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering.

        DIVIDEND POLICY 
        We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we decrease the size of this offering, or if the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option in full, our sponsor will forfeit an amount of Class B ordinary shares to maintain the ownership of our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of our sponsor’s founder shares), on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the sum of  (i) the number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option) plus (ii) the number of founder shares held by our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of such founder shares) following such forfeiture. Further, if we incur any indebtedness in connection with a business combination, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.

        DILUTION 
        The difference between the public offering price per Class A ordinary share, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units we are offering pursuant to this prospectus or the private placement warrants, and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our Class A ordinary shares after this offering constitutes the dilution to investors in this offering. Such calculation does not reflect any dilution associated with the sale and exercise of warrants, including the private placement warrants, which would cause the actual dilution to the public shareholders to be higher, particularly where a cashless exercise is utilized. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible assets less total liabilities (including the value of Class A ordinary shares which may be redeemed for cash), by the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares. 

          At September 30, 2017, our net tangible book value was $(613,638) or approximately $(0.07) per ordinary share. After giving effect to the sale of 30,000,000 Class A ordinary shares included in the units we are offering by this prospectus (or 34,500,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), the issuance of 3,750,000 founder shares to the anchor investors in a private placement prior to this offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the deduction of underwriting commissions and estimated expenses of this offering, our pro forma net tangible book value at September 30, 2017 would have been $5,000,007 or $0.39 per share ($0.36 per share if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), representing an immediate increase in net tangible book value (as decreased by the value of the approximately 28,555,403 Class A ordinary shares that may be redeemed for cash, or 32,897,903 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of $9.68 per share (or $9.71 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) to our initial shareholders as of the date of this prospectus and an immediate dilution to public shareholders from this offering of  $10.00 per share. Total dilution to public shareholders from this offering will be $9.61 per share (or $9.64 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). 

        The following table illustrates the dilution to the public shareholders on a per-share basis, assuming no value is attributed to the warrants included in the units or the private placement warrants:

          For purposes of presentation, we have reduced our pro forma net tangible book value after this offering (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) by $285,554,030 because holders of up to approximately 95.2% of our public shares may redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account at a per share redemption price equal to the amount in the trust account as set forth in our tender offer or proxy materials (initially anticipated to be the aggregate amount held in trust two days prior to the commencement of our tender offer or shareholders meeting, including interest and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of Class A ordinary shares sold in this offering.

        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of any such purchases of our shares prior to the completion of our initial business combination, the number of Class A ordinary shares subject to redemption will be reduced by the amount of any such purchases, increasing the pro forma net tangible book value per share.

          Our sponsor may loan us up to $200,000 under an unsecured promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of September 30, 2017, we had borrowed $91,993 under the promissory note with our sponsor. As of the date of this prospectus, we have borrowed $92,844 under the promissory note.

        Upon the completion of our initial business combination, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein whereby redemptions cannot cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and any limitations (including, but not limited to, cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination.

          Class B ordinary shares include 8,625,000 founder shares that were issued to our sponsor on September 30, 2017 (of which 525,000 founder shares were subsequently transferred to the BSOF Entities) and 3,750,000 founder shares that were subsequently issued to the anchor investors in a private placement in connection with the forward purchase agreements. Subject to certain exceptions to forfeiture, transfer and earnout provisions, the founder shares issued to the anchor investors and held by the BSOF Entities are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor, including restrictions on the ability to redeem such shares. The “As Adjusted” calculation assumes no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option and forfeiture of an aggregate of 1,125,000 founder shares held by our sponsor following the completion of this offering.

        Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
        Overview 
        We are a blank check company incorporated on July 13, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company and incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our shares, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt. 
        The issuance of additional shares in a business combination, including the issuance of the forward purchase shares: 
        •
        may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering, which dilution would increase if the anti-dilution provisions in the Class B ordinary shares resulted in the issuance of Class A ordinary shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares; 
        ​

          •
          may subordinate the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares if preference shares are issued with rights senior to those afforded our Class A ordinary shares; 
          ​

        •
        could cause a change in control if a substantial number of our Class A ordinary shares are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; 
        ​
        •
        may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the share ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us; and 
        ​
        •
        may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A ordinary shares and/or warrants. 
        ​
        Similarly, if we issue debt securities or otherwise incur significant debt, it could result in: 
        •
        default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; 
        ​
        •
        acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
        ​
        •
        our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; 
        ​
        •
        our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; 
        ​
        •
        our inability to pay dividends on our Class A ordinary shares; 
        ​
        •
        using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Class A ordinary shares if declared, expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; 
        ​
        •
        limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; 
        ​
        •
        increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and 
        ​
        •
        limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.

          As indicated in the accompanying financial statements, as of September 30, 2017, we had $47,267 in cash and deferred offering costs of  $630,175. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 

        Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 
        We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering. Following this offering, we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering. There has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements. After this offering, we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. We expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering. 
        Liquidity and Capital Resources 
        Our liquidity needs have been satisfied prior to the completion of this offering through receipt of a $25,000 capital contribution from our sponsor in exchange for the issuance of 8,625,000 founder shares to our sponsor (up to 1,125,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised), receipt of an aggregate sum of  $37,500 from the anchor investors in exchange for the issuance of 3,750,000 founder shares to the anchor investors and up to $200,000 in loans from our sponsor. We estimate that the net proceeds from (i) the sale of the units in this offering, after deducting offering expenses of  $1,000,000, underwriting commissions of  $6,000,000, or $6,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, (excluding deferred underwriting commissions of  $10,500,000, or $12,075,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) and (ii) the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of  $8,000,000 (or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be $301,000,000 (or $346,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full). $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be held in the trust account, which includes the deferred underwriting commissions described above. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.government treasury obligations. The remaining $1,000,000 will not be held in the trust account. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount. 
        We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less taxes payable and deferred underwriting commissions) and the proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our income taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the trust account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the trust account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we will have available to us the $1,000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account. We will use these funds to primarily identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination. 
        We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business prior to our initial business combination. However, if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our initial business combination. In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founder or his affiliate may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founder or an affiliate of our founder as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
        We expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately $350,000 for legal, accounting, due diligence, travel and other expenses associated with structuring, negotiating and documenting successful business combinations; $120,000 for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements; $150,000 for consulting, travel and miscellaneous expenses incurred during the search for an initial business combination target; $85,000 for NYSE continued listing fees; and $55,000 for general working capital that will be used for miscellaneous expenses and reserves. We will also reimburse our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to us in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month, or $240,000 in the aggregate. 
        These amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses. In addition, we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing, fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for transactions with other companies or investors on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, prospective target businesses. 
        Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account and the proceeds from the issuance of the forward purchase shares or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. 
        Controls and Procedures 
        We are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to comply with the internal control

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement. 
        Prior to the closing of this offering, we have not completed an assessment, nor has our independent registered public accounting firm tested our systems, of our internal controls. We expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and, if necessary, to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. Many small and mid-sized target businesses we may consider for our initial business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as: 
        •
        staffing for financial, accounting and external reporting areas, including segregation of duties; 
        ​
        •
        reconciliation of accounts; 
        ​
        •
        proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate; 
        ​
        •
        evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions; 
        ​
        •
        documentation of processes, assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates; and 
        ​
        •
        documentation of accounting policies and procedures.

        Because it will take time, management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business, we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities, particularly in the areas of designing, enhancing, or remediating internal and disclosure controls. Doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect, thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting. 
        Once our management’s report on internal controls is complete, we will retain our independent registered public accounting firm to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by Section 404. The independent registered public accounting firm may identify additional issues concerning a target business’s internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting. 
        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
        The net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be invested in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. 
        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations; Quarterly Results 

          As of September 30, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations. No unaudited quarterly operating data is included in this prospectus as we have not conducted any operations to date. 

        JOBS Act 
        The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an “emerging growth company” and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for

        private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
        Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an “emerging growth company,” we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an independent registered public accounting firm’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent registered public accounting firm’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our initial public offering or until we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” whichever is earlier.

        PROPOSED BUSINESS 
        Introduction 

          We are a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated on July 13, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any potential business combination target. 

        Business Strategy 
        Our business strategy is to identify and complete our initial business combination with a company that complements the experience of Mr. Asali and our operating and advisory committee and can benefit from their collective experiences and expertise to build shareholder value over the long-term. Key aspects of our business strategy will include: 
        •
        Sourcing investment opportunities through the broad and deep industry relationships of Mr. Asali, our operating and advisory committee, and some of our anchor investors. Mr. Asali has developed a broad range of relationships with industry leaders, investments bankers, consultants, legal advisors, financial sponsors, family offices, institutional investors and capital providers. Our operating and advisory committee members will help our sponsor formulate a clear strategy for the acquired business once a business combination is consummated. This committee could also be a potential source of new management and advisors for the acquired company. Finally, our anchor investors are distinguished family offices that we believe can provide us with access to unique pools of capital and investment opportunities from within the family office community. 
        ​
        •
        Targeting consumer products companies with attractive brands, strong management teams and scalable platforms. Sub-sectors on which we plan to focus include, but are not limited to, tools and building products, food and beverage, household products, garden and outdoor, lifestyle and experience. We intend to source acquisition opportunities from a number of sources, such as family owners, financial sponsors and corporate carve-outs. 
        ​
        •
        Implementing a strategy aimed at operational improvements such as margin improvement, free cash flow conversion, distribution and supply chain efficiencies and SG&A efficiencies. We believe these steps will help us create shareholder value by improving returns on invested capital while lowering the cost of capital of the acquired business. In addition, we will plan to grow through strategic acquisitions in comparable as well as adjacent categories. We will pursue tuck-in acquisitions as well as larger transactions that we believe will improve the overall business profile and be accretive to shareholders. 
        ​
        •
        Generating long-term shareholder value, consistent with our management team’s experience and capabilities and long-term investment horizons of our anchor investors. We believe this strategy will position us well to operate, adapt and grow any business that we acquire through multiple cycles. Furthermore, we believe that this approach differentiates and positions us well with current like-minded, long-term oriented owners of target businesses potentially making them more receptive to transact with us. 
        ​
        •
        Implementing a capital structure that reflects our focus on preservation of capital and maintaining operational flexibility while building a diversified platform. 
        ​
        •
        Implementing centralized capital allocation and decentralized operations with a cost-effective management team and a pay-for-performance culture. 
        ​
        In addition, we believe our ability to complete an initial business combination will be enhanced by our having entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants, for a purchase price of  $10.00 per Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. We believe this committed capital will provide our company 
      
      
        78
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        with greater certainty to complete a business combination with potential sellers. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. The proceeds from the sale of forward purchase shares may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, expenses in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in the post-transaction company. These purchases will be made regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination. 
        Our Management Team 
        Our founder, Omar Asali, is Chairman and CEO of One Madison Group LLC, our sponsor. Our sponsor seeks to build an industry leading sustainable operating business with high returns on invested capital and robust free cash flow generation. We intend to take a patient and disciplined approach to investing with an emphasis on compounding capital over the long-term. We intend to partner with excellent management teams and foster an ownership culture with strong alignment of incentives. Our management team has deep expertise across multiple industries and regions as well as an extensive network of industry and functional experts that can be valuable resources to our investments. We will be further supported by our operating and advisory committee comprised of four former senior executives from leading global consumer and industrial companies with experience in a wide range of sub-sectors and functional areas who will provide us with access to their expertise and extensive industry networks from which we intend to source and evaluate targets as well as devise plans to optimize any business that we acquire. 
        While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any industry or location, we intend to focus on the consumer sector and consumer-related businesses based predominantly in North America with global reach. We believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify, evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire in the following categories: (i) consumer products or services, (ii) food and beverage and (iii) adjacent manufacturing or industrial services businesses linked to a consumer end-user. We intend to target businesses that have stable cash flows, strong management teams, and attractive growth prospects over the long term. Our management and our operating and advisory committee have extensive experience not only identifying and executing the acquisition of private and public companies, but also the running and operating of businesses post-transaction. 
        Successful companies in the consumer products sector traditionally have had several characteristics that make them unique and highly sought after, including their ability to generate strong free cash flow and operate throughout various economic cycles. Such companies typically had strong margin profiles, returns on invested capital greater than their cost of capital, strong demand for their products, proven product development capability, a diverse distribution network with deep retailer relationships as well as an efficient and robust supply chain that can meet evolving customer needs. These businesses also have been able to support strong cash flow generation and growth, both through increasing top line revenue from improved distribution and product development as well as a sharp focus on achieving greater operating efficiencies and process improvements. Effective management teams with a clear set of long-term goals and proper incentives are integral to building leading sustainable businesses in the space. 
        Recent developments in e-commerce, social media, digital marketing, and direct-to-consumer distribution are rapidly altering the competitive landscape, primarily by reducing the barriers to entry and changing the way consumers learn about and interact with companies and their products. These changes have attracted a large number of entrepreneurs and venture investors in categories long-dominated by large established companies. Many traditional consumer companies are facing a range of unique market and industry dynamics that we believe will create attractive opportunities for our company to pursue. In particular, traditional consumer products companies are confronted with new and disruptive business models primarily driven by advancements in technology along with the growth of e-commerce and niche product lines, resulting in significant changes to consumer spending behavior and purchasing habits as well as retail and distribution networks. As a result, larger, global consumer products companies, under pressure 
      
      
        79
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        by the marketplace, activist investors and competition from smaller and more nimble companies, have announced plans to divest certain brands and non-core businesses as a means to cut costs and re-focus on key products. In addition, other privately-owned businesses are seeking new long-term owners and capital providers in order to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving consumer landscape. Through Mr. Asali and our operating and advisory committee members, we believe we have assembled a team whose broad-based industry experience, deep network and extensive functional expertise in areas such as operations, manufacturing, supply chain optimization, financial management, capital markets, sales and marketing and e-commerce can significantly improve the outlook for the business we acquire. Our operating and advisory committee has in depth knowledge and global experience in a variety of industries touching the consumer including: food and beverage, pet products, household products and appliances, tools and building products as well as garden and outdoor products. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this disruption and capitalize on potential opportunities. We believe our collective experience and skillset will allow us to understand the impact of current disruption, identify attractive opportunities and develop an effective value creation strategy post-acquisition, including reshaping operating strategy and infrastructure to better address the challenges discussed above. 
        We believe our sponsor and anchor investors, who share our long-term approach to capital allocation and strategic decision making, will assist us in implementing our objectives and are a key differentiator for our company. Our sponsor and anchor investors, who are primarily comprised of family offices, are focused on compounding equity value over the long-term. Our sponsor believes that it takes discipline, long-term perspective, strategic thinking, and proper resources to build a business with industry-leading operating efficiencies and that can serve as an attractive growth platform for future accretive acquisitions. We believe sellers of family-owned businesses would seek to transition ownership of a business they have built over many years and in some cases, generations, to a company focused on building and achieving a positive and sustainable outcome for all stakeholders. Our sponsor is focused on implementing a conservative capital structure that provides the business with the flexibility it needs to weather cycles and evolve in a dynamic competitive landscape. Our sponsor is focused on the preservation of capital and intends to implement a capital structure that reflects this mindset. 

          Mr. Asali has an extensive background of relevant industry and public company experience. Most recently, he served as President and Chief Executive Officer of HRG, a publicly traded diversified holding company, from March 2015 until April 2017, as its President since October 2011 and a director from May 2011 to April 2017. In addition to HRG, Mr. Asali served as Vice Chairman of the board of directors of Spectrum Brands, HRG’s majority owned and NYSE listed consumer products company with an $8.3 billion market capitalization at the time of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG, and as a member of the board of directors of FGL, HRG’s majority owned NYSE-listed insurance company, which had a $1.6 billion market capitalization at the time of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG. As Chief Executive Officer and President of HRG, Mr. Asali was responsible for overseeing its day-to-day activities, including M&A activity and overall business strategy for HRG and its subsidiaries as well as identifying performance metrics to better align management teams with meeting business objectives. During his time at HRG, Mr. Asali was directly involved in all of HRG’s acquisitions across all sectors and was actively involved in HRG’s management and investment activities. Under Mr. Asali’s leadership, HRG achieved substantial shareholder value both organically and through strategic transactions. During this time: 

        •
        HRG grew from a public shell company with a market capitalization of  $119 million in 2010 into a diversified holding company with a market capitalization of  $3.9 billion as of April 14, 2017, the date of Mr. Asali’s departure from HRG. HRG completed numerous successful financings over this time period and lowered its blended cost of debt from 10.625% to 7.8%. 
        ​
        •
        HRG shareholders achieved returns of 286% (or a compound annual growth rate of greater than 27%) from the time Mr. Asali became President in October 2011 until his departure in April of 2017 and HRG’s key subsidiaries also achieved strong returns. Spectrum Brand’s share price appreciated 497% in that timeframe while HRG’s investment in FGL achieved a total rate of return of 399%. 
        ​
        •
        HRG acquired FGL in 2011 for $300 million (net of a $50 million purchase price adjustment). In December 2013, FGL completed a successful partial initial public offering of 11.2 million shares

        at $17.00, valuing HRG’s remaining stake of approximately 80% at approximately $799 million and paying HRG a special dividend of  $43 million from the offering proceeds. FGL recently undertook a strategic sale process that ultimately resulted in the announced sale to CF Corp. for $31.10 per share, valuing HRG’s stake at $1.46 billion and resulting, assuming completion, in a total return of greater than 450% for HRG shareholders since inception. 

          •
          HRG acquired Spectrum Brands from Harbinger Capital in January of 2011. Spectrum Brands acquired Stanley Black & Decker’s Hardware & Home Improvement Group as well as Armored AutoGroup for $1.4 billion each and completed numerous tuck-in acquisitions as well as debt and equity financings. Shares in Spectrum Brands increased by 497% from October 2011 to April 14, 2017. In that time period Spectrum Brand’s market capitalization increased from $1.2 billion to approximately $8.3 billion. 
          ​


          Additionally, during the time Mr. Asali served as President, HRG held investments in various financing and asset management firms, including CorAmerica Capital, LLC, Five Island Asset Management, LLC, FIAM Capital Management, LLC, Energy & Infrastructure Capital, LLC and Salus Capital Partners, LLC, as well as investments in Front Street Re (Cayman) Ltd., a life and annuity re-insurer, and Compass Production Partners, LP, an oil and gas company. Prior to becoming President of HRG, Mr. Asali was a Managing Director and Head of Global Strategy of Harbinger Capital where he was responsible for global portfolio strategy and business development. Before joining Harbinger Capital in 2009, Mr. Asali was the co-head of Goldman Sachs HFS where he helped manage approximately $25 billion of capital allocated to external managers. Mr. Asali also served as co-chair of the Investment Committee at Goldman Sachs HFS. Before joining Goldman Sachs HFS in 2003, Mr. Asali worked in Goldman Sachs’ Investment Banking Division, providing M&A and strategic advisory services to clients in the High Technology Group. Mr. Asali previously worked at Capital Guidance, a boutique private equity firm. Mr. Asali began his career working for a public accounting firm. Mr. Asali received an MBA from Columbia Business School and a B.S. in Accounting from Virginia Tech. 

        With respect to the foregoing experiences of Mr. Asali, past performance is not a guarantee (i) that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or (ii) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management’s performance as indicative of our future performance. None of our officers has any past experience with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition companies.

          On December 15, 2017, we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with our sponsor and the BSOF Entities pursuant to which our sponsor transferred 525,000 founder shares and the BSOF Entities have agreed to act as our strategic partner and may provide debt or equity financing in connection with our initial business combination, but are not required to do so. The founder shares held by the BSOF Entities are subject to certain transfer restrictions, forfeiture and earnout provisions similar to those imposed upon our sponsor and the anchor investors. If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have agreed to vote any founder shares they may own in favor of such initial business combination. The BSOF Entities may designate one observer to our board of directors until the consummation of our initial business combination. The BSOF Entities have also separately agreed to purchase an aggregate of 560,000 private placement warrants, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of this offering. Such private placement warrants will have the same terms and conditions as those to be purchased by our anchor investors. The BSOF Entities will be entitled to registration rights with respect any ordinary shares and warrants held by them. We believe that the combination of capital provided by our anchor investors and a strategic partnership with the BSOF Entities will provide us with a material advantage in effecting an initial business combination.

        Initial Business Combination 
        NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm 
      
      
        81
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion. 
        We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 
        Consistent with our business strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We intend to seek to acquire companies that we believe have: 
        •
        Strong Brands and Leading Market Positions: We intend to seek companies with strong brands and leading market positions that we believe are highly sought after by consumers and distributors, can perform through various cycles and withstand disruptive developments to the business. We intend to seek highly attractive brands that offer compelling value to consumers that we can distribute through a variety of channels. 
        ​
        •
        Product Development and Manufacturing Infrastructure: We intend to pursue a target with a proven track record of strong operational execution and that has control over a substantial amount of their manufacturing processes. While we are focused on companies with low capital intensity and limited required maintenance capital expenditures, we believe owning a solid manufacturing footprint would provide greater control over quality of products manufactured, cost management, and achieving operational efficiencies while also providing opportunity for expansion in product lines and geographies. We also intend to pursue a target with a culture of product development and innovation to maintain relevancy for existing products and build brands that resonate in households worldwide.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        ​
        •
        Scalable Platform: We intend to acquire platforms that provide the infrastructure and capacity necessary to grow through new product launches and acquisitions while maintaining a competitive existing operating cost structure to enable management to pursue consolidation opportunities and realize synergies. We intend to focus on businesses that operate within a fragmented space where we can utilize our skill-sets to consolidate a number of attractive businesses over time. 
        ​
        •
        Experienced Management: While our management and our operating and advisory committee bring industry expertise that will assist in identifying acquisition opportunities and could serve as a source of management talent, we intend to focus on companies with strong existing management teams that are well positioned to continue running the business and will benefit from access to our expertise and experiences, networks and capital. 
        ​
        •
        Opportunities for Improved Strategic Planning and Incentive Structures: We intend to focus on identifying opportunities to improve existing business plans using our collective experience from different businesses. We further intend to focus on identifying metrics and developing incentive plans that will align managers with meeting near term business goals while building long-term shareholder value. 
        ​
        •
        Attractive Cash Flow: We intend to target companies with strong free cash flow generation from existing products, high profit margins (or a path to obtaining them) and revenue where we have strong visibility or that is recurring. 
        ​
        •
        Opportunity for Operational Improvement: We intend to target companies where we believe there is capacity to improve the penetration of the existing product line and optimize work flow processes and distribution networks to lower costs, adapt to a changing market environment and become more competitive. 
        ​
        •
        Attributes to Benefit as a Public Company: We intend to target companies that could benefit from access to the public equity markets with new holders and long-term investors that will support the company’s growth objectives. We also expect to benefit from access to the term debt markets where our sponsor has a proven track record of successfully completing financings and protecting the principal of capital providers. We expect to develop a capital structure that is appropriate for the target company while lowering our cost of capital. 
        ​
        Our Acquisition Process 
        In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews and inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. 
        We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view and follow such other procedures as set forth in our related party transaction policy (see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions — Related Party Transaction Policy”). 

          Each of our officers and directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private placement warrants following this offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of such officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 


          Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity subject to his or her fiduciary duties

          under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

        Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering. 
        Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
        Status as a Public Company 
        We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our Class A ordinary shares (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our Class A ordinary shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. 
        Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders’ interests and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 
        While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek shareholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively. 
        We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
        Financial Position 
        With funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of  $440,500,000, after payment of offering expenses of  $1,000,000 and underwriting commissions of  $16,500,000 (or $483,925,000 after payment of offering expenses of  $1,000,000 and underwriting commissions of  $18,975,000 if the

        underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 
        Effecting Our Initial Business Combination 
        General 
        We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering, the private placements of the private placement warrants and the forward purchase shares, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 
        There are many companies that may be financially unstable, including (i) mature businesses that have been in operation for long periods of time, but have either experienced recent difficulties, are not properly managed or have invested in new lines of business that have drained resources from the primary business or (ii) entities without established records of sales or earnings that are valued based on their balance sheet components (i.e. intellectual property), management and personnel experience, competitive position or other intangible assets that may be valued. To the extent that the Company seeks to pursue a business combination with a financially unstable business, it will only do so if such business has a fair value of at least 80% of the assets in the trust account at such time and after a thorough due diligence review consistent with that described below under “— Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination.” 
        If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 
        We have not identified any business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions with any business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a target business, other than our officers and directors. Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business. 
        We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account and the proceeds from the issuance of the forward purchase shares or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no 
      
      
        85
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the forward purchase agreements, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise. 
        Sources of Target Businesses 
        We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this prospectus and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, and our anchor investors may also bring to our attention target business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the track record and business relationships of our officers and directors. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by us prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such target by us. 
        We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
        Evaluation of a Target Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination 
        In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction. 
        The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.

        Lack of Business Diversification 
        For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 
        •
        subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and 
        ​
        •
        cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. 
        ​
        Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team 
        Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 
        We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 
        Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 
        Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination 
        We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 
        Under the NYSE’s listing rules, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 
        •
        We issue ordinary shares that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of our ordinary shares then outstanding (other than in a public offering); or 
        ​
        •
        The issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control. 
        ​
        Permitted Purchases of Our Securities 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our 
      
      
        87
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. 
        In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 
        The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 
        In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 
        Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the shareholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 
        Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements. 
        Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination 
        We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share 
      
      
        88
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. 

        Limitations on Redemptions 
        Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 
        Manner of Conducting Redemptions 
        We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement or whether we were deemed to be a foreign private issuer (which would require a tender offer rather than seeking shareholder approval under SEC rules). Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons. 
        If we held a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
        •
        conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and 
        ​
        •
        file proxy materials with the SEC. 
        ​
        In the event that we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

          If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and (other than the BSOF Entities) any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares (excluding 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors who is restricted from voting such shares), we would need 9,621,876, or approximately 32.1%, of

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          the 30,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, public shares in connection with the completion of a business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. 

        If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association: 
        •
        conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and 
        ​
        •
        file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
        ​
        Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 
        In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 
        Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 20% of the public shares without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. 
        However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.

          Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights 


          Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

        There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 
        The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the shareholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 
        Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the shareholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination. 

          If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates (if any) delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

        If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until 24 months from the closing of this offering. 
        Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination 
        Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provided that we will have only 24 months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable

          to complete our initial business combination within such 24-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 24-month time period. 

        Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 
        Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. 
        We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $1,000,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional working capital we will need to identify one or more target businesses and to complete our initial business combination, as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 
        If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims. 
        Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent

        inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of  (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 
        In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of  (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case less taxes payable, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per share. 
        We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to $1,000,000 from the proceeds of this offering with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. In the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  $1,000,000, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount. Conversely, in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  $1,000,000, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount.

          If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

        Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote. 
        Comparison of Redemption or Purchase Prices in Connection with Our Initial Business Combination and If We Fail to Complete Our Initial Business Combination. 
        The following table compares the redemptions and other permitted purchases of public shares that may take place in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering.

            ​
            ​
            Redemptions at the time of our initial business combination may be made pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. The redemption price will be the same whether we conduct redemptions pursuant to a tender offer or in connection with a shareholder vote. In either case, our public shareholders may redeem their public shares for cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination
            ​
            ​
            If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit to the prices that our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may pay in these transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material
            ​
            ​
            If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will redeem all public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount, then on deposit in the trust account (which is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per share), including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares.

We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

            ​
            The redemptions in connection with our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for our remaining shareholders, who will bear the burden of the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable. 
            ​
            ​
            If the permitted purchases described above are made, there would be no impact to our remaining shareholders because the purchase price would not be paid by us. 
            ​
            ​
            The redemption of our public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination will reduce the book value per share for the shares held by our initial shareholders, who will be our only remaining shareholders after such redemptions.

        Comparison of This Offering to Those of Blank Check Companies Subject to Rule 419 
        The following table compares the terms of this offering to the terms of an offering by a blank check company subject to the provisions of Rule 419. This comparison assumes that the gross proceeds, underwriting commissions and underwriting expenses of our offering would be identical to those of an offering undertaken by a company subject to Rule 419, and that the underwriters will not exercise their over-allotment option. None of the provisions of Rule 419 apply to our offering.

            Interest on proceeds from the trust account to be paid to shareholders is reduced by (i) any taxes paid or payable and (ii) in the event of our liquidation for failure to complete our initial business combination within the allotted time, up to $100,000 of net interest that may be released to us should we have no or insufficient working capital to fund the costs and expenses of our dissolution and liquidation. 
            ​
            ​
            Interest on funds in escrow account would be held for the sole benefit of investors, unless and only after the funds held in escrow were released to us in connection with our completion of a business combination.

            Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of our assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. 
            ​
            ​
            The fair value or net assets of a target business must represent at least 80% of the maximum offering proceeds.

The Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units will begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. We anticipate filing such Current Report on Form 8-K four business days from the closing of this offering. If the over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the over-allotment option. 
            ​
            ​
            No trading of the units or the underlying Class A ordinary shares and warrants would be permitted until the completion of a business combination. During this period, the securities would be held in the escrow or trust account.

            We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. We may not be required by law to hold a shareholder vote. If we are not required by law and do not otherwise decide to hold a shareholder vote, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, we hold a shareholder vote, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 
            ​
            ​
            A prospectus containing information pertaining to the business combination required by the SEC would be sent to each investor. Each investor would be given the opportunity to notify the company in writing, within a period of no less than 20 business days and no more than 45 business days from the effective date of a post-effective amendment to the company’s registration statement, to decide if he, she or it elects to remain a shareholder of the company or require the return of his, her or its investment. If the company has not received the notification by the end of the 45th business day, funds and interest or dividends, if any, held in the trust or escrow account are automatically returned to the shareholder. Unless a sufficient number of investors elect to remain investors, all funds on deposit in the escrow account must be returned to all of the investors and none of the securities are issued.

        Competition 
        In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 
        Facilities 
        We currently maintain our executive offices at 3 East 28th Street, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10016. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we will pay to our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Employees 
        We currently have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We intend to have three employees upon the completion of this offering. 
        Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 
        We will register our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants. 
        We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 
        We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 
        Prior to the date of this prospectus, we will file a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination. 
        We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law. As an exempted company, we have applied for and expect to receive, after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2011 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us. 
        We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting 
      
      
        99
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 
        In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 
        We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer,” which means the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
        Legal Proceedings 
        There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such.

        Number and Terms of Office of Officers and Directors 

          In accordance with NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. Our officers are appointed by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association as it deems appropriate. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our officers may consist of one or more chairmen of the board, chief executive officers, a president, chief financial officer, vice presidents, secretary, treasurer and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors.

        In addition, the forward purchase agreements provide two of our anchor investors with the right to designate (prior to the consummation of a Business Combination) and the right to request the designation of  (following the consummation of a Business Combination) a total of two observers to our board of directors. 
        Director Independence 

          NYSE listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent. Our board of directors has determined that Thomas F. Corley, Keith R. McLoughlin, Michael A. Jones and Robert C. King are “independent directors” as defined in the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors will have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. 

        Executive Officer and Director Compensation 
        None of our executive officers or directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE through the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation, we will reimburse our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to us in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. In addition, our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such reimbursements, we do not expect to have any additional controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with our activities on our behalf in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination. Other than these payments and reimbursements, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by us to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to completion of our initial business combination. 
        After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. 
        We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management’s motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment. 
        Committees of the Board of Directors 
        Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, our board of directors will have three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee and a

        nominating and corporate governance committee. In addition, we will establish the operating and advisory committee, which will be an advisory committee of the Board of Directors formed for the purpose of assisting management with sourcing and evaluating business opportunities and devising plans and strategies to optimize any business that we acquire. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the NYSE rules and Rule 10A of the Exchange Act require that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. Subject to phase-in rules and a limited exception, the rules of the NYSE require that the compensation committee and nominating and corporate governance committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. 
           Audit Committee 

          Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will have an audit committee of the board of directors. Thomas F. Corley, Keith R. McLoughlin, Michael A. Jones and Robert C. King will serve as members of our audit committee. Under the NYSE listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee, all of whom must be independent, subject to the exception described below. Thomas F. Corley, Keith R. McLoughlin, Michael A. Jones and Robert C. King are independent.


          Robert C. King will serve as the chairman of the audit committee. Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Thomas F. Corley, Keith R. McLoughlin, Michael A. Jones and Robert C. King each qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined in applicable SEC rules. 

        We will adopt an audit committee charter, which will detail the principal responsibilities of the audit committee, including: 
        •
        meeting with our independent auditor regarding, among other issues, audits, and adequacy of our accounting and control systems;

        ​
        •

        ​
        •
        establishing procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or reports which raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies; 
        ​
        •
        monitoring compliance on a quarterly basis with the terms of this offering and, if any noncompliance is identified, immediately taking all action necessary to rectify such noncompliance or otherwise causing compliance with the terms of this offering; and 
        ​
        •
        reviewing and approving all payments made to our existing shareholders, executive officers or directors and their respective affiliates. Any payments made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. 
        ​
        The charter will also provide that the audit committee has the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisers as it determines necessary to carry out its duties. The written charter will be available on our website. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

The members of our compensation committee will be Thomas F. Corley, Keith R. McLoughlin, Michael A. Jones and Robert C. King, with Michael A. Jones serving as chairman of the compensation committee. We will adopt a compensation committee charter, which will detail the principal functions of the compensation committee, including: 

        •
        reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our chief executive officer’s compensation, evaluating our chief executive officer’s performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our chief executive officer based on such evaluation;

        ​
        The charter will also provide that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any such adviser. However, before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel or any other adviser, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by the NYSE and the SEC. The written charter will be available on our website. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 
           Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        The nominating and corporate governance committee will be governed by a charter that complies with the rules of the NYSE, and will be available on our website. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this prospectus or the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. 
           Director Nominations 
        Our nominating and corporate governance committee will recommend to the board of directors candidates for nomination for election at the first annual meeting of the shareholders. Prior to our initial business combination, the board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by holders of our founder shares during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at an annual meeting of shareholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of shareholders). Prior to our initial business combination, holders of our public shares will not have the right to recommend director candidates for nomination to our board. 
        We have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom and the ability to represent the best interests of our shareholders. 
           Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
        None of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors. 
        Code of Ethics 
        Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we will have adopted a Code of Ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees. We have filed a copy of our Code of Ethics and our audit committee and compensation committee charters as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. You will be able to review these documents by accessing our public filings at the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. Upon completion of this offering, the Code of Ethics will be available on our website. In addition, a copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 
        Conflicts of Interest 
        Under Cayman Islands law, directors and officers owe the following fiduciary duties: 
        •
        duty to act in good faith in what the director or officer believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole; 
        ​
        •
        duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose; 
        ​
        •
        directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion; 
        ​
        •
        duty to exercise powers fairly as between different sections of shareholders; 
        ​
        •
        duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and 
        ​
        •
        duty to exercise independent judgment. 
        ​
        In addition to the above, directors also owe a duty of care which is not fiduciary in nature. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience of that director.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        As set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings. 

          Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to his or her fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination. 

        Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering.

        Potential investors should also be aware of the following other potential conflicts of interest:

        Our executive officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search

        for a business combination and their other businesses. Certain of our executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors for which such officers may be entitled to substantial compensation, and our executive officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week to our affairs.

          •
          As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,100,000 founder shares. Pursuant to a letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed to transfer an aggregate of 240,000 founder shares to our independent directors (each receiving 60,000 shares) prior to the consummation of this offering.
          ​


          •
          The anchor investors (including our founder and each of our other executive officers) purchased founder shares prior to the date of this prospectus, and such anchor investors and the BSOF Entities will purchase private placement warrants in a transaction that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Additionally, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. If we do not complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. Our initial shareholders (other than our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the date following the completion of our initial business combination on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; and our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) the third anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the waiver of the foregoing restriction by anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, the founder shares held by our initial shareholders (other than the earnout shares) will be released from the lockup. In addition, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which our sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares. The private placement warrants will not be transferable until 30 days following the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, we, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to certain transfer restrictions for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions. See “Underwriting.” Because each of our executive officers and directors will own ordinary shares and/​or warrants, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. 
          ​

        •
        Our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 
        ​
        We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors or making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, executive officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm, that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. Furthermore, in no event will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, be paid by us any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination. Further, commencing on the date our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we will also reimburse our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to us in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. 

        We cannot assure you that any of the above-mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor. 

          In the event that we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, and they and the other members of our management team have agreed to vote any shares purchased during or after the offering, in favor of our initial business combination, other than the BSOF Entities. 

        Limitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors 
        Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We expect to purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 
        We will enter into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of incorporation. Pursuant to these agreements, our officers and directors will agree to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if  (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. 
        Our indemnification obligations may discourage shareholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our shareholders. Furthermore, a shareholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. 
        We believe that these provisions, the insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced officers and directors.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS​
      
        PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS 
        The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of the date of this prospectus, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our Class A ordinary shares included in the units offered by this prospectus, and assuming no purchase of units in this offering, by: 
        •
        each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares; 
        ​
        •
        each of our executive officers and directors that beneficially owns ordinary shares; and 
        ​
        •
        all our executive officers and directors as a group. 
        ​
        Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all of our ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The following table does not reflect record or beneficial ownership of the private placement warrants as these warrants are not exercisable within 60 days of the date of this prospectus. 

          As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,100,000 founder shares. Prior to the transfer of 525,000 founder shares to the BSOF Entities, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares, which were issued in exchange for a capital contribution of  $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Prior to the initial investment in the company of  $25,000 by the sponsor, the company had no assets, tangible or intangible. The per share price of the founder shares was determined by dividing the amount contributed to the company by the number of founder shares issued. In addition, in connection with the forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. Pursuant to a letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed to transfer 240,000 founder shares to four of our independent directors (each receiving 60,000 shares) prior to the consummation of this offering, which transfer is reflected in the following table. The post-offering percentages in the following table assume that the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, that our sponsor forfeits 1,125,000 founder shares following this offering and that there are 41,250,000 ordinary shares issued and outstanding after this offering.

        Immediately after this offering, our initial shareholders will beneficially own 26.4% of the then issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering and the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares) and will have the right to elect all of our directors prior to our initial business combination. Holders of our public shares will not have the right to elect any directors to our board of directors prior to our initial business combination. Because of this ownership block, our initial shareholders may be able to effectively influence the outcome of all other matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including amendments to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approval of significant corporate transactions including our initial business combination. 

          The anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which our founder has committed to purchase 2,006,041 (assuming no exercise of the over-alloment option), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the private placement warrants will expire worthless. The private placement warrants are subject to the transfer restrictions described below. The private placement warrants will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial anchor investors and the BSOF Entities who purchased such warrants or their respective permitted transferees. Such anchor investors and the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial anchor investors, the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. Otherwise, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. 


          Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors (including our founder and each of our other executive officers) agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants for a purchase price of  $10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary

          shares purchased, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. In connection with these agreements, we also issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants, except that, pursuant to the applicable forward purchase agreement, one of the anchor investors will receive forward purchase warrants exercisable only for Class C ordinary shares. 


          The forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement also provide that the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities are entitled to (i) a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans from our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) by us, including for capital raising purposes, or if we offer or seek commitments for any equity or equity-linked securities to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than the units we are offering by this prospectus and their component public shares and warrants, the founder shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for which such founder shares are convertible), the forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants and the private placement warrants, and any securities issued by us as consideration to any seller in our initial business combination and warrants issued upon the conversion of working capital loans to us made by our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) and (ii) registration rights with respect to (A) the forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, including any time after we complete our initial business combination.

        Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering. 

          In addition, the forward purchase agreements for two of our anchor investors provide each such anchor investor with (i) the right to designate (prior to the consummation of a Business Combination) and the right to request the designation of  (following the consummation of a Business Combination) one observer to our board of directors and (ii) the right to acquire, at the same price paid by, directly or indirectly, and on the same terms and conditions as, our founder, a number of founder shares equal to its pro rata share, based on its allocation of forward purchase shares, of five percent of the founder shares of any special purpose acquisition company sponsored by our founder for 10 years following the closing of our initial business combination, which we refer to as the new acquisition company. Further, such forward purchase agreements for the same two anchor investors provide such investors with the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  $63,000,000 in equity securities of the new acquisition company substantially similar to the forward purchase securities on the same or more favorable terms as new investors in such equity securities. The strategic partnership agreement provides that, so long as the Company remains a “blank check company” as such term is defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act and prior to our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors.

        Our sponsor, the anchor investors and Mr. Asali are deemed to be our “promoters” as such term is defined under the federal securities laws.

In addition, the anchor investors, the BSOF Entities and our sponsor and their respective affiliates may transfer their Class B ordinary shares and Class A ordinary shares issued upon conversion thereof  (i) as a bona fide gift or gifts; (ii) as a distribution to limited partners, members or stockholders such investors; (iii) to affiliates, to any investment fund or other entity controlled or managed by such investors, or to any investment manager or investment advisor of such investor or an affiliate of any such investment manager or investment advisor, (iv) to a nominee or custodian of a person or entity to whom a disposition or transfer would be permissible under clauses (i) through (iii) above, and (v) pursuant to an order of a court or regulatory agency; provided, however, that these permitted transferees must enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer restrictions. We or our sponsor may waive the lock-up restrictions applicable to securities held by the BSOF Entities, provided that the lock-up restrictions applicable to securities held by the anchors investors will be similarly waived on a pro rata basis.

        With respect to our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate, the foregoing lock-up restrictions shall not apply to: 
        •
        any transfer by our sponsor to any of its employees, officers or directors or transfers by any employee, officer or director of our sponsor (other than our founder) or such person’s permitted transferees, in one or more transactions, of up to 20.0% of the founder shares held by such person immediately following the closing of our initial business combination;

The number of earnout shares subject to forfeiture will initially be 2,250,000 (of which 157,500 are initially held by the BSOF Entities and 2,092,500 are initially held by our sponsor). In connection with the foregoing, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have also agreed to not transfer, assign or sell any of its earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date an earnout condition has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which our sponsor forfeits the earnout shares.


          In addition, we, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to certain transfer restrictions for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions. See “Underwriting.”

        Registration Rights 

          Pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into concurrently with the closing of this offering, the holders of the private placement warrants, the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans, and the founder shares, will be entitled to registration rights with respect to such warrants and the ordinary shares underlying such warrants and founder shares. These holders will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have “piggy-back” registration rights to include their securities in other registration statements filed by us. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period, which is described above under “— Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.”


          Pursuant to the forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement, we have agreed that we will use our reasonable best efforts (i) to file within 30 days after the closing of the initial business combination (and, with respect to clause (B) below, within 30 days following announcement of the results of the shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination or the results of our offer to shareholders to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination (whichever is later), which we refer to as the “disclosure date”) a registration statement with the SEC for a secondary offering of (A) the forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C

Prior to the transfer of 525,000 founder shares to the BSOF Entities, our sponsor held an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares, which were issued in exchange for a capital contribution of  $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share.

In addition, in connection with the forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares, 588,875 of which were issued to our founder, for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. If we decrease the size of this offering, or if the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option in full, our sponsor will forfeit an amount of Class B ordinary shares to maintain the ownership of our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of our sponsor’s founder shares including the BSOF Entities), on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option) plus (ii) the number of founder shares held by our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of such founder shares including the BSOF Entities) following such forfeiture. 


          The anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which our founder has committed to purchase 2,006,041 (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option), each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. Each private placement warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share. The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. 


          Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants, for a purchase price of  $10.00 per Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate, in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. Our founder has agreed to purchase 2,355,500 forward purchase shares and 785,167 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of  $23,555,000. JS Capital LLC has agreed to purchase 10,325,000 forward purchase shares and 3,441,667 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of  $103,250,000. In addition, (i) Bharani Bobba, our chief financial officer, has agreed to purchase 17,000 forward purchase shares and 5,667 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of  $170,000, (ii) William Drew, our secretary, has agreed to purchase 40,000 forward purchase shares and 13,333 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of  $400,000 and (iii) Ernest Behr, an immediate family member of William Drew, has agreed to purchase 25,000 forward purchase shares and 8,333 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of  $250,000. In connection with these forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares, 588,875 of which were issued to our founder, for $0.01 per share prior to this offering. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own. The forward purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. 


          The forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement also provide that the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities are entitled to (i) a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans from our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) by us, including for capital raising purposes, or if we

          offer or seek commitments for any equity or equity-linked securities to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with the closing of our initial business combination (other than the units we are offering by this prospectus and their component public shares and warrants, the founder shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for which such founder shares are convertible), the forward purchase shares, forward purchase warrants and the private placement warrants, and any securities issued by us as consideration to any seller in our initial business combination and warrants issued upon the conversion of working capital loans to us made by our founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) and (ii) registration rights with respect to their (A) forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors, including any time after we complete our initial business combination.


          In addition, the forward purchase agreements for two of our anchor investors provide each such anchor investor with (i) the right to designate (prior to the consummation of a Business Combination) and the right to request the designation of  (following the consummation of a Business Combination) one observer to our board of directors and (ii) the right to acquire a number of founder shares equal to its pro rata share, based on its allocation of forward purchase shares, of five percent of the founder shares of any special purpose acquisition company sponsored by our founder for 10 years following the date of the closing of our initial business combination, which we refer to as the new acquisition company. Further, such forward purchase agreements for the same two anchor investors provide such investors with the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  $63,000,000 in equity securities of the new acquisition company substantially similar to the forward purchase securities on the same or more favorable terms as new investors in such equity securities. The strategic partnership agreement provides that, so long as the Company remains a “blank check company” as such term is defined in Rule 419 under the Securities Act and prior to our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors.


          Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering.

        We currently maintain our executive offices at 3 East 28th St, 8th Floor, New York, New York 10016. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month, or $240,000 in the aggregate, fee we will pay to our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, administrative and support services, commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. 
        Other than these monthly fees, no compensation of any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid by us to our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the completion of an initial business combination. However, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Our audit committee will review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their affiliates. 
        Pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor has agreed to transfer 240,000 founder shares to four of our independent directors (each receiving 60,000 shares) prior to the consummation of this offering. The letter agreement further provides that if any such director voluntarily resigns from or departs the board of directors, such director automatically forfeits all of the founder shares then owned by the director back to our sponsor. 

          Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us funds to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan would be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the estimated $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

        In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founder or his affiliate may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required on a non-interest basis. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our founder or an affiliate of our founder as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
        After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. 
        We have entered into a registration rights agreement with respect to the founder shares and private placement warrants, which is described under the heading “Principal Shareholders — Registration Rights.” 
        Related Party Transaction Policy 
        We have not yet adopted a formal policy for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions. Accordingly, the transactions discussed above were not reviewed, approved or ratified in accordance with any such policy. 
        Prior to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt a written policy relating to the approval of related person transactions. A “related person transaction” is a transaction or arrangement or series of transactions or arrangements in which we participate (whether or not we are a party) and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest in such transaction. Our audit committee will review and approve or ratify all relationships and related person transactions between us and (i) our directors, director nominees or executive officers, (ii) any 5% record or beneficial owner of our ordinary shares or (iii) any immediate family member of any person specified in (i) and (ii). The audit committee will review all related person transactions and, where the audit committee determines that such transactions are in our best interests, approve such transactions in advance of such transaction being given effect. 
        As set forth in the related person transaction policy, in the course of its review and approval or ratification of a related party transaction, the audit committee will, in its judgment, consider in light of the relevant facts and circumstances whether the transaction is, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests, including consideration of various factors enumerated in the policy. 
        Any member of the audit committee who is a related person with respect to a transaction under review will not be permitted to participate in the discussions or approval or ratification of the transaction. Our policy also includes certain exceptions for transactions that need not be reported and provides the audit committee with the discretion to pre-approve certain transactions.

        DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES 

          We are a Cayman Islands exempted company (company number 324775) and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law and the common law of the Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association which will be adopted upon the consummation of this offering, we will be authorized to issue 425,000,000 ordinary shares, $0.0001 par value each, including 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, 25,000,000 Class B ordinary shares and 200,000,000 Class C ordinary shares, and 1,000,000 preference shares, $0.0001 par value each. The following description summarizes certain terms of our shares as set out more particularly in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. Because it is only a summary, it may not contain all the information that is important to you. 

        Units 
        Each unit has an offering price of  $10.00 and consists of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of  $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of the company’s Class A ordinary shares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. 
        The Class A ordinary shares and warrants comprising the units are expected to begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of this prospectus unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated inform us of their decision to allow earlier separate trading, subject to our having filed the Current Report on Form 8-K described below and having issued a press release announcing when such separate trading will begin. Once the Class A ordinary shares and warrants commence separate trading, holders will have the option to continue to hold units or separate their units into the component securities. Holders will need to have their brokers contact our transfer agent in order to separate the units into Class A ordinary shares and warrants. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. 
        In no event will the Class A ordinary shares and warrants be traded separately until we have filed with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K which includes an audited balance sheet reflecting our receipt of the gross proceeds of this offering. We anticipate filing such Current Report on Form 8-K four business days from the closing of the offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised following the initial filing of such Current Report on Form 8-K, a second or amended Current Report on Form 8-K will be filed to provide updated financial information to reflect the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option. 
        Ordinary Shares 
        Prior to the date of this prospectus, there were 12,375,000 Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, all of which were held of record by our initial shareholders, so that our initial shareholders will own 26.4% of our issued and outstanding Class A ordinary shares after this offering (on an as-converted basis, assuming our initial shareholders do not purchase any units in this offering and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares). Upon the closing of this offering, 41,250,000 of our ordinary shares will be outstanding (assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) including: 
        •
        30,000,000 Class A ordinary shares underlying the units issued as part of this offering; and 
        ​
        •
        11,250,000 Class B ordinary shares held by our initial shareholders. 
        ​

          If we decrease the size of this offering, or if the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option in full, our sponsor will forfeit an amount of Class B ordinary shares to maintain the ownership of our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of our sponsor’s founder shares including the BSOF Entities), on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option) plus (ii) the number of founder

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          shares held by our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of such founder shares including the BSOF Entities) following such forfeiture. Up to 1,125,000 founder shares are subject to forfeiture by our sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised. 

        Holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by shareholders and will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as required by law. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares, except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. Unless specified in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, or as required by applicable provisions of the Companies Law or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of the Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our shareholders. Approval of certain actions will require a special resolution under Cayman Islands law, being the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of our Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares that are voted, and pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association; such actions include amending our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and approving a statutory merger or consolidation with another company. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors, with the result that the holders of more than 50% of the shares voted for the election of directors can elect all of the directors. Our shareholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefor. 
        Because our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize the issuance of up to 200,000,000 Class A ordinary shares, if we were to enter into a business combination, we may (depending on the terms of such a business combination) be required to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares which we are authorized to issue at the same time as our shareholders vote on the business combination to the extent we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination. 
        Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class (except for those directors appointed prior to our first annual meeting of shareholders) serving a three-year term. In accordance with NYSE corporate governance requirements, we are not required to hold an annual meeting until no later than one year after our first fiscal year end following our listing on the NYSE. There is no requirement under the Companies Law for us to hold annual or general meetings or elect directors. We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. 

          We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, any public shares they may acquire during or after this offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Unlike many blank check companies that hold shareholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of 

      
      
        121
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, if a shareholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require these tender offer documents to contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the initial business combination. However, the participation of our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions (as described in this prospectus), if any, could result in the approval of our initial business combination even if a majority of our public shareholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding ordinary shares, non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days’ notice will be given of any general meeting. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote will be taken to approve our initial business combination. 
        If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% of the public shares without our prior consent. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination. Our shareholders’ inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination, and such shareholders could suffer a material loss in their investment if they sell such Excess Shares on the open market. Additionally, such shareholders will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination. And, as a result, such shareholders will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 20% and, in order to dispose such shares would be required to sell their shares in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. 

          If we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, other than the BSOF Entities, any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares (excluding 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors who is restricted from voting such shares), we would need 9,621,876, or approximately 32.1%, of the 30,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted and the over-allotment option is not exercised). The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. 

        Pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders 
      
      
        122
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      

          (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders or management team acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time period. 

        In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company after a business combination, our shareholders are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining available for distribution to them after payment of liabilities and after provision is made for each class of shares, if any, having preference over the ordinary shares. Our shareholders have no preemptive or other subscription rights. There are no sinking fund provisions applicable to the ordinary shares, except that we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares for cash at a per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, upon the completion of our initial business combination, subject to the limitations described herein. 
        Founder Shares 

          The founder shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and, except as described below, are identical to the Class A ordinary shares included in the units being sold in this offering, and holders of founder shares have the same shareholder rights as public shareholders, except that (i) the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below, (ii) our initial shareholders have entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed (A) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, (B) to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, public shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (C) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within such time period, (iii) the founder shares are automatically convertible into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) at the time of our initial business combination as described herein, and (iv) prior to the completion of our initial business combination, only our founder shares will have the right to vote on the election of our directors. If we submit our initial business combination to our public shareholders for a vote, our initial shareholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and, other than the BSOF Entities, any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination, subject to contractual restrictions on voting such shares with respect to 493,750 founder shares held by one of our anchor investors. The other members of our management team have entered into agreements similar to the one entered into by our sponsor with respect to any public shares acquired by them in or after this offering. 

        The founder shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination at a ratio such that the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option), plus (ii) the sum of  (a) the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any

          equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by us in connection with or in relation to the consummation of our initial business combination (including the forward purchase shares, but not the forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the initial business combination and any warrants issued in a private placement to our founder or an affiliate of our founder upon conversion of working capital loans, minus (b) the number of public shares redeemed by public shareholders in connection with our initial business combination. The Class C ordinary shares are convertible into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis (i) at the election of the holder with 65 days’ written notice or (ii) upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary shares to an unaffiliated third party. Any conversion of Class B ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares) described herein will take effect as a redemption of Class B ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares) and an issuance of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, as a matter of Cayman Islands law.


          In connection with the forward purchase agreements, we issued to the anchor investors 3,750,000 founder shares. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own. In connection with the strategic partnership agreement, our sponsor transfered to the BSOF Entities 525,000 founder shares, which shares, subject to certain exceptions to forfeiture, transfer and earnout provisions, are subject to similiar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder shares issued to the anchor investors.


          Our initial shareholders (other than our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; and our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of  (i) the third anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the waiver of the foregoing restriction by anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares (in either case, except as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same applicable restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the lock-up. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, the founder shares held by our initial shareholders (other than the earnout shares) will be released from the lock-up. In addition, 2,250,000 founder shares, which constitute the earnout shares, will be subject to forfeiture by our sponsor (or its permitted transferees) and the BSOF Entities on the fifth anniversary of our initial business combination unless following our initial business combination, either (A) the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares (or any successor class of ordinary shares or common shares) equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share and, in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period or (B) we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for consideration in cash, securities or other property which equals or exceeds, in the case of our sponsor, $12.50 per share and, in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like). See “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants.” In addition, we, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed to certain transfer restrictions for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions. See “Underwriting.”

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Register of Members 
        Under Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of members and there will be entered therein: 
        •
        the names and addresses of the members, a statement of the shares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member; 
        ​
        •
        the date on which the name of any person was entered on the register as a member; and 
        ​
        •
        the date on which any person ceased to be a member. 
        ​
        Under Cayman Islands law, the register of members of our company is prima facie evidence of the matters set out therein (i.e. the register of members will raise a presumption of fact on the matters referred to above unless rebutted) and a member registered in the register of members will be deemed as a matter of Cayman Islands law to have legal title to the shares as set against its name in the register of members. Upon the closing of this public offering, the register of members will be immediately updated to reflect the issue of shares by us. Once our register of members has been updated, the shareholders recorded in the register of members will be deemed to have legal title to the shares set against their name. However, there are certain limited circumstances where an application may be made to a Cayman Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position. Further, the Cayman Islands court has the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified where it considers that the register of members does not reflect the correct legal position. If an application for an order for rectification of the register of members were made in respect of our ordinary shares, then the validity of such shares may be subject to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court. 

          Preference Shares 


          Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association authorize 1,000,000 preference shares and provide that preference shares may be issued from time to time in one or more series. Our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights, if any, designations, powers, preferences, the relative, participating, optional or other special rights and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, applicable to the shares of each series. Our board of directors will be able to, without shareholder approval, issue preference shares with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the ordinary shares and could have anti-takeover effects. The ability of our board of directors to issue preference shares without shareholder approval could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management. We have no preference shares outstanding at the date hereof. Although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preference shares, we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future. No preference shares are being issued or registered in this offering. 

        Warrants 
           Public Shareholders’ and Forward Purchase Warrants 
        Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share (or, at the holder’s election with respect to a forward purchase warrant, one Class C ordinary share) at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the closing of this offering or 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination, provided in each case that we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or we permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis under the circumstances specified in the warrant agreement) and such shares are registered, qualified or exempt from registration under the securities, or blue sky, laws of the state of residence of the holder. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares. This means only a whole warrant may be exercised at a given time by a warrant holder. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade. Accordingly, unless you purchase at least two units, you will not be able to receive or trade a whole warrant. The warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        We will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Class A ordinary shares underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. No warrant will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue a Class A ordinary share or a Class C ordinary share upon exercise of a warrant unless the Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the Class A ordinary share underlying such unit. 
        We have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than thirty (30) business days after the closing of our initial business combination, we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) day after the closing of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. 
        Once the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption: 
        •
        in whole and not in part; 
        ​
        •
        at a price of  $0.01 per warrant; 
        ​
        •
        upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption (the “30-day redemption period”) to each warrant holder; and 
        ​

          •
          if, and only if, the reported last sales price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
          ​

        If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. 

          We have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants, each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date. However, the price of the public shares may fall below the $18.00 redemption trigger price (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued. 

        If we call the warrants for redemption as described above, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his, her or its warrant to do so on a “cashless basis.” In determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a “cashless basis,” our management will consider, among other factors, our cash position, the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our shareholders of issuing the maximum number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of our warrants. If our management takes advantage of this 
      
      
        126
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        option, all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” will mean the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. If our management takes advantage of this option, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares to be received upon exercise of the warrants, including the “fair market value” in such case. Requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption. We believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination. If we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option, the holders of the private placement warrants and their permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, as described in more detail below. 
        A holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates), to the warrant agent’s actual knowledge, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (as specified by the holder) of the Class A ordinary shares issued and outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise. 
        If the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares is increased by a share capitalization, a share dividend payable in Class A ordinary shares, a split-up of ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization, dividend, split-up or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding ordinary shares. A rights offering to holders of ordinary shares entitling holders to purchase Class A ordinary shares at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a share dividend of a number of Class A ordinary shares equal to the product of  (i) the number of Class A ordinary shares actually sold in such rights offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class A ordinary shares) and (ii) the quotient of  (x) the price per Class A ordinary share paid in such rights offering and (y) the fair market value. For these purposes, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for Class A ordinary shares, in determining the price payable for Class A ordinary shares, there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) fair market value means the volume weighted average price of Class A ordinary shares as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the Class A ordinary shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without the right to receive such rights. 

          In addition, if we, at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to the holders of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares on account of such Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares (or other securities into which the warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described above, (b) certain ordinary cash dividends, (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a proposed initial business combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of associations to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within 24 months after the closing of this offering, (e) as a result of the repurchase of Class A ordinary shares by us if a proposed initial business combination is presented to our shareholders for approval, or (f) in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination, then the warrant exercise price will be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such event, by the amount of cash and/or the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, in respect of such event.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        If the number of outstanding Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination, reverse share split or reclassification of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation, combination, reverse share split, reclassification or similar event, the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares issuable on exercise of each warrant, as applicable, will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary share, as applicable. 
        Whenever the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted, as described above, the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, as applicable, and (y) the denominator of which will be the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares so purchasable immediately thereafter, as applicable. 

          In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares (other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares), or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding Class A ordinary shares or our outstanding Class C ordinary shares), or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved, the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of Class A ordinary shares, Class C ordinary shares or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event. If less than 70% of the consideration receivable by the holders of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares in such a transaction is payable in the form of ordinary shares in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established over-the-counter market, or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event, and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction, the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the Black-Scholes value (as defined in the warrant agreement) of the warrant. The purpose of such exercise price reduction is to provide additional value to holders of the warrants when an extraordinary transaction occurs during the exercise period of the warrants pursuant to which the holders of the warrants otherwise do not receive the full potential value of the warrants. 


          The warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least 65% of the then outstanding public warrants and forward purchase warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. You should review a copy of the warrant agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants. 

        The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive Class A ordinary shares. After the issuance of Class A ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders. The Class C ordinary shares do not entitle their holder to any voting rights.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, to be issued to the warrant holder. 
           Private Placement Warrants 

          The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except, among other limited exceptions as described under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the anchor investors, the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees) and they will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the initial anchor investors or BSOF Entities who purchased such warrants or their respective permitted transferees. Such anchor investors or BSOF Entities or their respective permitted transferees have the option to exercise the private placement warrants on a cashless basis. Except as described below, the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering. If the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial anchor investors, the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees, the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering. 


          If holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis, they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his, her or its warrants for that number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The “fair market value” will mean the average reported closing price of the Class A ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent. The reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the anchor investors, the BSOF Entities and their permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination. If they remain affiliated with us, their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited. We expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time. Even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities, an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material non-public information. Accordingly, unlike public shareholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the Class A ordinary shares received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise, the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities. As a result, we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate. 

        In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our founder or his affiliate may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. 

          The anchor investors and the BSOF Entities have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of any of these warrants) until the date that is 30 days after the date we complete our initial business combination, except that, among other limited exceptions as described under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants,” transfers can be made to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with the sponsor. 

        Dividends 
        We have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial

          condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. If we decrease the size of this offering, or if the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option in full, our sponsor will forfeit an amount of Class B ordinary shares to maintain the ownership of our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of our sponsor’s founder shares including the BSOF Entities), on an as-converted basis, at 20% of the sum of  (i) the total number of public shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option) plus (ii) the number of founder shares held by our sponsor (together with any permitted transferees of such founder shares including the BSOF Entities) following such forfeiture. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith. 

        Our Transfer Agent and Warrant Agent 
        The transfer agent for our ordinary shares and warrant agent for our warrants is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. We have agreed to indemnify Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent, its agents and each of its shareholders, directors, officers and employees against all claims and losses that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity, except for any claims and losses due to any gross negligence or intentional misconduct of the indemnified person or entity. 
        Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company has agreed that it has no right of set-off or any right, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any monies in, the trust account, and has irrevocably waived any right, title, interest or claim of any kind to, or to any monies in, the trust account that it may have now or in the future. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied, or a claim will only be able to be pursued, solely against us and our assets outside the trust account and not against the any monies in the trust account or interest earned thereon. 
        Certain Differences in Corporate Law 
        Cayman Islands companies are governed by the Companies Law. The Companies Law is modeled on English Law but does not follow recent English Law statutory enactments, and differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the material differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States and their shareholders. 
        Mergers and Similar Arrangements. In certain circumstances, the Companies Law allows for mergers or consolidations between two Cayman Islands companies, or between a Cayman Islands exempted company and a company incorporated in another jurisdiction (provided that is facilitated by the laws of that other jurisdiction). 
        Where the merger or consolidation is between two Cayman Islands companies, the directors of each company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation containing certain prescribed information. That plan or merger or consolidation must then be authorized by either (a) a special resolution (usually a majority of 662∕3% in value of the voting shares voted at a general meeting) of the shareholders of each company; or (b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company’s articles of association. No shareholder resolution is required for a merger between a parent company (i.e., a company that owns at least 90% of the issued shares of each class in a subsidiary company) and its subsidiary company. The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest of a constituent company must be obtained, unless the court waives such requirement. If the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies is satisfied that the requirements of the Companies Law (which includes certain other formalities) have been complied with, the Registrar of Companies will register the plan of merger or consolidation. 
        Where the merger or consolidation involves a foreign company, the procedure is similar, save that with respect to the foreign company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the merger or consolidation is permitted or not prohibited by the constitutional documents of the foreign company and by the laws of the jurisdiction in 
      
      
        130
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        which the foreign company is incorporated, and that those laws and any requirements of those constitutional documents have been or will be complied with; (ii) that no petition or other similar proceeding has been filed and remains outstanding or order made or resolution adopted to wind up or liquidate the foreign company in any jurisdictions; (iii) that no receiver, trustee, administrator or other similar person has been appointed in any jurisdiction and is acting in respect of the foreign company, its affairs or its property or any part thereof; and (iv) that no scheme, order, compromise or other similar arrangement has been entered into or made in any jurisdiction whereby the rights of creditors of the foreign company are and continue to be suspended or restricted. 
        Where the surviving company is the Cayman Islands exempted company, the directors of the Cayman Islands exempted company are further required to make a declaration to the effect that, having made due enquiry, they are of the opinion that the requirements set out below have been met: (i) that the foreign company is able to pay its debts as they fall due and that the merger or consolidated is bona fide and not intended to defraud unsecured creditors of the foreign company; (ii) that in respect of the transfer of any security interest granted by the foreign company to the surviving or consolidated company (a) consent or approval to the transfer has been obtained, released or waived; (b) the transfer is permitted by and has been approved in accordance with the constitutional documents of the foreign company; and (c) the laws of the jurisdiction of the foreign company with respect to the transfer have been or will be complied with; (iii) that the foreign company will, upon the merger or consolidation becoming effective, cease to be incorporated, registered or exist under the laws of the relevant foreign jurisdiction; and (iv) that there is no other reason why it would be against the public interest to permit the merger or consolidation. 
        Where the above procedures are adopted, the Companies Law provides for a right of dissenting shareholders to be paid a payment of the fair value of his shares upon their dissenting to the merger or consolidation if they follow a prescribed procedure. In essence, that procedure is as follows: (a) the shareholder must give his written objection to the merger or consolidation to the constituent company before the vote on the merger or consolidation, including a statement that the shareholder proposes to demand payment for his shares if the merger or consolidation is authorized by the vote; (b) within 20 days following the date on which the merger or consolidation is approved by the shareholders, the constituent company must give written notice to each shareholder who made a written objection; (c) a shareholder must within 20 days following receipt of such notice from the constituent company, give the constituent company a written notice of his intention to dissent including, among other details, a demand for payment of the fair value of his shares; (d) within seven days following the date of the expiration of the period set out in paragraph (b) above or seven days following the date on which the plan of merger or consolidation is filed, whichever is later, the constituent company, the surviving company or the consolidated company must make a written offer to each dissenting shareholder to purchase his shares at a price that the company determines is the fair value and if the company and the shareholder agree the price within 30 days following the date on which the offer was made, the company must pay the shareholder such amount; and (e) if the company and the shareholder fail to agree a price within such 30 day period, within 20 days following the date on which such 30 day period expires, the company (and any dissenting shareholder) must file a petition with the Cayman Islands Grand Court to determine the fair value and such petition must be accompanied by a list of the names and addresses of the dissenting shareholders with whom agreements as to the fair value of their shares have not been reached by the company. At the hearing of that petition, the court has the power to determine the fair value of the shares together with a fair rate of interest, if any, to be paid by the company upon the amount determined to be the fair value. Any dissenting shareholder whose name appears on the list filed by the company may participate fully in all proceedings until the determination of fair value is reached. These rights of a dissenting shareholder are not available in certain circumstances, for example, to dissenters holding shares of any class in respect of which an open market exists on a recognized stock exchange or recognized interdealer quotation system at the relevant date or where the consideration for such shares to be contributed are shares of any company listed on a national securities exchange or shares of the surviving or consolidated company. 
        Moreover, Cayman Islands law has separate statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction or amalgamation of companies in certain circumstances, schemes of arrangement will generally be more suited for complex mergers or other transactions involving widely held companies, commonly referred to in the Cayman Islands as a “scheme of arrangement” which may be tantamount to a merger. In the event that a merger was sought pursuant to a scheme of arrangement (the procedures for which are more rigorous and 
      
      
        131
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        take longer to complete than the procedures typically required to consummate a merger in the United States), the arrangement in question must be approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made and who must in addition represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meeting summoned for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the terms of the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder would have the right to express to the court the view that the transaction should not be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it satisfies itself that: 
        •
        we are not proposing to act illegally or beyond the scope of our corporate authority and the statutory provisions as to majority vote have been complied with; 
        ​
        •
        the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question; 
        ​
        •
        the arrangement is such as a businessman would reasonably approve; and 
        ​
        •
        the arrangement is not one that would more properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law or that would amount to a “fraud on the minority.” 
        ​
        If a scheme of arrangement or takeover offer (as described below) is approved, any dissenting shareholder would have no rights comparable to appraisal rights (providing rights to receive payment in cash for the judicially determined value of the shares), which would otherwise ordinarily be available to dissenting shareholders of United States corporations. 
        Squeeze-out Provisions. When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares to whom the offer relates is made within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands, but this is unlikely to succeed unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith, collusion or inequitable treatment of the shareholders. 
        Further, transactions similar to a merger, reconstruction and/or an amalgamation may in some circumstances be achieved through means other than these statutory provisions, such as a share capital exchange, asset acquisition or control, or through contractual arrangements of an operating business. 
        Shareholders’ Suits. Our Cayman Islands counsel is not aware of any reported class action having been brought in a Cayman Islands court. Derivative actions have been brought in the Cayman Islands courts, and the Cayman Islands courts have confirmed the availability for such actions. In most cases, we will be the proper plaintiff in any claim based on a breach of duty owed to us, and a claim against (for example) our officers or directors usually may not be brought by a shareholder. However, based both on Cayman Islands authorities and on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority and be applied by a court in the Cayman Islands, exceptions to the foregoing principle apply in circumstances in which: 
        •
        a company is acting, or proposing to act, illegally or beyond the scope of its authority; 
        ​
        •
        the act complained of, although not beyond the scope of the authority, could be effected if duly authorized by more than the number of votes which have actually been obtained; or 
        ​
        •
        those who control the company are perpetrating a “fraud on the minority.” 
        ​
        A shareholder may have a direct right of action against us where the individual rights of that shareholder have been infringed or are about to be infringed. 
        Enforcement of Civil Liabilities. The Cayman Islands has a different body of securities laws as compared to the United States and provides less protection to investors. Additionally, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to sue before the Federal courts of the United States. 
        We have been advised by our Cayman Islands legal counsel that the courts of the Cayman Islands are unlikely (i) to recognize or enforce against us judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state; and (ii) in original actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability 
      
      
        132
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States or any state, so far as the liabilities imposed by those provisions are penal in nature. In those circumstances, although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation to pay the sum for which judgment has been given provided certain conditions are met. For a foreign judgment to be enforced in the Cayman Islands, such judgment must be final and conclusive and for a liquidated sum, and must not be (i) in respect of taxes, a fine or penalty, (ii) inconsistent with a Cayman Islands judgment in respect of the same matter, (iii) impeachable on the grounds of fraud or (iv) obtained in a manner, or be of a kind the enforcement of which is, contrary to natural justice or the public policy of the Cayman Islands (awards of punitive or multiple damages may well be held to be contrary to public policy). A Cayman Islands Court may stay enforcement proceedings if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere. See “Risk Factors — After our initial business combination, it is possible that a majority of our directors and officers will live outside the United States and all of our assets will be located outside the United States; therefore, investors may not be able to enforce federal securities laws or their other legal rights.” 
        Special Considerations for Exempted Companies. We are an exempted company with limited liability (meaning our public shareholders have no liability, as members of the company, for liabilities of the company over and above the amount paid for their shares) under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident companies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands may apply to be registered as an exempted company. The requirements for an exempted company are essentially the same as for an ordinary company except for the exemptions and privileges listed below: 
        •
        annual reporting requirements are minimal and consist mainly of a statement that the company has conducted its operations mainly outside of the Cayman Islands and has complied with the provisions of the Companies Law; 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company’s register of members is not open to inspection; 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company does not have to hold an annual general meeting; 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company may issue negotiable or bearer shares or shares with no par value; 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation (such undertakings are usually given for 20 years in the first instance); 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands; 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company may register as a limited duration company; and 
        ​
        •
        an exempted company may register as a segregated portfolio company. 
        ​
        Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 
        The Business Combination Article of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association contains provisions designed to provide certain rights and protections relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without a special resolution. As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a resolution is deemed to be a special resolution where it has been approved by either (i) at least two-thirds (or any higher threshold specified in a company’s articles of association) of a company’s shareholders at a general meeting for which notice specifying the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution has been given; or (ii) if so authorized by a company’s articles of association, by a unanimous written resolution of all of the company’s shareholders. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that special resolutions must be approved either by at least two-thirds of our shareholders (i.e., the lowest threshold permissible under Cayman Islands law), or by a unanimous written resolution of all of our shareholders.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Our initial shareholders, who will collectively beneficially own approximately 26.4% of our Class A ordinary shares (on an as-converted basis) upon the closing of this offering (assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering and the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option and excluding 493,750 Class B ordinary shares held by one of our anchor investors who is expected to elect to convert such shares into Class C ordinary shares), will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose. Specifically, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide, among other things, that: 

          •
          If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law; 
          ​

        •
        Prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on our initial business combination; 
        ​
        •
        Although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor, our directors or our executive officers, we are not prohibited from doing so. In the event we enter into such a transaction, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view; 
        ​
        •
        If a shareholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, and will file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act; 
        ​
        •
        Our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination; 
        ​
        •
        If our shareholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their ordinary shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein; and 
        ​
        •
        We will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 
        ​
      
      ​

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        In addition, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. 
        The Companies Law permits a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands to amend its memorandum and articles of association with the approval of a special resolution. A company’s articles of association may specify that the approval of a higher majority is required but, provided the approval of the required majority is obtained, any Cayman Islands exempted company may amend its memorandum and articles of association regardless of whether its memorandum and articles of association provides otherwise. Accordingly, although we could amend any of the provisions relating to our proposed offering, structure and business plan which are contained in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we view all of these provisions as binding obligations to our shareholders and neither we, nor our officers or directors, will take any action to amend or waive any of these provisions unless we provide dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares. 
        Anti-Money Laundering — Cayman Islands 
        In order to comply with legislation or regulations aimed at the prevention of money laundering, we are required to adopt and maintain anti-money laundering procedures, and may require subscribers to provide evidence to verify their identity and source of funds. Where permitted, and subject to certain conditions, we may also delegate the maintenance of our anti-money laundering procedures (including the acquisition of due diligence information) to a suitable person. 

          We reserve the right to request such information as is necessary to verify the identity of a subscriber. In some cases, the directors may be satisfied that no further information is required since an exemption applies under the Money Laundering Regulations (2015 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, as amended and revised from time to time (the “Regulations”). Depending on the circumstances of each application, a detailed verification of identity might not be required where: 

        (a)
        the subscriber makes the payment for their investment from an account held in the subscriber’s name at a recognized financial institution; 
        ​
        (b)
        the subscriber is regulated by a recognized regulatory authority and is based or incorporated in, or formed under the law of, a recognized jurisdiction; or 
        ​
        (c)
        the application is made through an intermediary which is regulated by a recognized regulatory authority and is based in or incorporated in, or formed under the law of a recognized jurisdiction and an assurance is provided in relation to the procedures undertaken on the underlying investors. 
        ​
        For the purposes of these exceptions, recognition of a financial institution, regulatory authority or jurisdiction will be determined in accordance with the Regulations by reference to those jurisdictions recognized by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority as having equivalent anti-money laundering regulations. 
        In the event of delay or failure on the part of the subscriber in producing any information required for verification purposes, we may refuse to accept the application, in which case any funds received will be returned without interest to the account from which they were originally debited. 
        We also reserve the right to refuse to make any payment to a shareholder if our directors or officers suspect or are advised that the payment to such shareholder might result in a breach of applicable anti-money laundering or other laws or regulations by any person in any relevant jurisdiction, or if such refusal is considered necessary or appropriate to ensure our compliance with any such laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction. 
        If any person resident in the Cayman Islands knows or suspects, or has reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that another person is engaged in criminal conduct or is involved with terrorism or terrorist property and the information for that knowledge or suspicion came to their attention in the course of business in the regulated sector or other trade, profession, business or employment, the person will be required to report such knowledge or suspicion to (i) the Financial Reporting Authority of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the Proceeds of Crime Law (2017 Revision) of the Cayman Islands if the disclosure 
      
      
        135
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        relates to criminal conduct or money laundering or (ii) a police officer of the rank of constable or higher, or the Financial Reporting Authority, pursuant to the Terrorism Law (2017 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, if the disclosure relates to involvement with terrorism or terrorist financing and property. Such a report will not be treated as a breach of confidence or of any restriction upon the disclosure of information imposed by any enactment or otherwise. 
        Certain Anti-Takeover Provisions of our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association 
        Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors. As a result, in most circumstances, a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings. 

          Our authorized but unissued Class A ordinary shares and preference shares are available for future issuances without shareholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future offerings to raise additional capital, acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved Class A ordinary shares and preference shares could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or otherwise. 

        Securities Eligible for Future Sale 
        Immediately after this offering, we will have 41,250,000 (or 46,875,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Of these shares, the Class A ordinary shares sold in this offering (30,000,000 Class A ordinary shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised and 34,500,000 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except for any Class A ordinary shares purchased by one of our affiliates within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. All of the outstanding founder shares (11,250,000 founder shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised and 12,375,000 founder shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) and all of the outstanding private placement warrants (8,000,000 warrants if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is not exercised and 8,900,000 warrants if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be restricted securities under Rule 144, in that they were issued in private transactions not involving a public offering. 
        Upon the closing of the sale of the forward purchase securities, all of the 15,000,000 forward purchase shares, 5,000,000 forward purchase warrants and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the forward purchase warrants will be restricted securities under Rule 144. 
           Rule 144 
        Pursuant to Rule 144, a person who has beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that (i) such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale and (ii) we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least three months before the sale and have filed all required reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act during the 12 months (or such shorter period as we were required to file reports) preceding the sale. 
        Persons who have beneficially owned restricted shares or warrants for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the three months preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of: 
        •
        1% of the total number of ordinary shares then outstanding, which will equal 412,500 shares immediately after this offering (or 468,750 if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option); or 
        ​
        •
        the average weekly reported trading volume of the Class A ordinary shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale. 
        ​
      
      ​
      
        136
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Sales by our affiliates under Rule 144 are also limited by manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us. 
           Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies 
        Rule 144 is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by shell companies (other than business combination related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. However, Rule 144 also includes an important exception to this prohibition if the following conditions are met: 
        •
        the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; 
        ​
        •
        the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 
        ​
        •
        the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and 
        ​
        •
        at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. 
        ​

          As a result, our initial shareholders will be able to sell their founder shares and private placement warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Rule 144 without registration one year after we have completed our initial business combination subject to availability of current public information about us. 

        Registration Rights 

          Pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into concurrently with the closing of this offering, the holders of the private placement warrants, the warrants that may be issued upon conversion of the working capital loans, and the founder shares will be entitled to registration rights with respect to such warrants and the ordinary shares underlying such warrants and founder shares. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that we register such securities for sale under the Securities Act. In addition, these holders will have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination. However, the registration rights agreement provides that we will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lockup period, which occurs (i) in the case of the founder shares, as described in the following paragraph, and (ii) in the case of the private placement warrants and the respective Class A ordinary shares underlying such warrants, 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 


          Our initial shareholders (other than our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the closing of our initial business combination or (ii) the date on which we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after our initial business combination that results in all of our ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; and our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of  (i) the third anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination or (ii) the waiver of the foregoing restriction by anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares (in either case except as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same applicable restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. In addition, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which our sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares. We refer to such transfer restrictions throughout this prospectus as the lock-up. Notwithstanding the

          foregoing, if the closing price of our Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, all founder shares held by our initial shareholders (other than the earnout shares) will be released from the lock-up. 


          Pursuant to the forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement, we have agreed that we will use our reasonable best efforts (i) to file within 30 days after the closing of the initial business combination (and, with respect to clause (B) below, within 30 days following announcement of the results of the shareholder vote relating to our initial business combination or the results of our offer to shareholders to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with our initial business combination (whichever is later), which we refer to as the “disclosure date”) a registration statement with the SEC for a secondary offering of (A) the anchor investors’ forward purchase securities and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying their forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and BSOF Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities, including any time after we complete our initial business combination, (ii) to cause such registration statement to be declared effective promptly thereafter, but in no event later than 60 days after the closing of the initial business combination or the disclosure date, as the case may be and (iii) to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement until the earliest of  (A) the date on which the anchor investor or BSOF Entity ceases to hold the securities covered thereby and (B) the date all of the securities covered thereby can be sold publicly without restriction or limitation under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and without the requirement to be in compliance with Rule 144(c)(1) under the Securities Act, subject to certain conditions and limitations set forth in the forward purchase agreements. We will bear the cost of registering these securities.

        Listing of Securities 

          We have applied to have our units listed on the NYSE under the symbol “OMAD.U” commencing on or promptly after the date of this prospectus. We cannot guarantee that our securities will be approved for listing on the NYSE. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, we expect that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will be listed on the NYSE under the symbols “OMAD” and “OMAD.W,” respectively. We will not have units traded following consummation of our initial business combination.

        Taxation
        The following summary of certain Cayman Islands and United States federal income tax consequences generally applicable to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our units, each consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant, is based upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this prospectus, all of which are subject to change. This summary does not deal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our Class A ordinary shares and warrants, such as the tax consequences under state, local and other tax laws. 
        Prospective investors should consult their advisors on the possible tax consequences of investing in our securities under the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile. 
        Cayman Islands Tax Considerations 
        The following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in the securities of the Company. The discussion is a general summary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular circumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law. 
        Under Existing Cayman Islands Laws: 
        Payments of dividends and capital in respect of our securities will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the payment of a dividend or capital to any holder of the securities nor will gains derived from the disposal of the securities be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax. The Cayman Islands currently have no income, corporation or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax. 
        No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of the warrants. An instrument of transfer in respect of a warrant is stampable if executed in or brought into the Cayman Islands. 
        No stamp duty is payable in respect of the issue of our Class A ordinary shares or on an instrument of transfer in respect of such shares. 

          The Company has been incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, has applied for and expects to obtain after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part an undertaking from the Financial Secretary of the Cayman Islands in the following form: 

        The Tax Concessions Law (2011 Revision) Undertaking as to Tax Concessions 

          In accordance with the provision of Section 6 of The Tax Concessions Law (2011 Revision), the Financial Secretary undertakes with One Madison Corporation (“the Company”): 

        1.
        That no law which is hereafter enacted in the Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to the Company or its operations; and 
        ​
        2.
        In addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax shall be payable:

        United States Federal Income Tax Considerations 
           General 
        The following discussion summarizes certain United States federal income tax considerations generally applicable to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our units (each consisting of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant) that are purchased in this offering by U.S. Holders (as defined below) and Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). Because the components of a unit are generally separable at the option of the holder, the holder of a unit generally should be treated, for United States federal income tax purposes, as the owner of the underlying Class A ordinary share and warrant components of the unit. As a result, the discussion below with respect to holders of Class A ordinary shares and warrants should also apply to holders of units (as the deemed owners of the underlying Class A ordinary shares and warrants that constitute the units). 
        This discussion is limited to certain United States federal income tax considerations to beneficial owners of our securities who are initial purchasers of a unit pursuant to this offering and hold the unit and each component of the unit as a capital asset under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). This discussion assumes that the Class A ordinary shares and warrants will trade separately and that any distributions made (or deemed made) by us on our Class A ordinary shares and any consideration received (or deemed received) by a holder in consideration for the sale or other disposition of our securities will be in U.S. dollars. This discussion is a summary only and does not consider all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be relevant to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of a unit by a prospective investor in light of its particular circumstances, including: 
        •
        anchor investors; 
        ​
        •
        financial institutions or financial services entities; 
        ​
        •
        broker-dealers; 
        ​
        •
        taxpayers that are subject to the mark-to-market accounting rules; 
        ​
        •
        tax-exempt entities; 
        ​
        •
        governments or agencies or instrumentalities thereof; 
        ​
        •
        insurance companies; 
        ​
        •
        regulated investment companies; 
        ​
        •
        real estate investment trusts; 
        ​
        •
        expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States; 
        ​

          •
          persons that actually or constructively own five percent or more of our voting shares or ten percent or more of the total value of our shares; 
          ​

        •
        persons that acquired our securities pursuant to an exercise of employee share options, in connection with employee share incentive plans or otherwise as compensation; 
        ​
        •
        persons that hold our securities as part of a straddle, constructive sale, hedging, conversion or other integrated or similar transaction; or 
        ​
        •
        U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. 
        ​
        Moreover, the discussion below is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as of the date hereof, and such provisions may be repealed, revoked, modified or subject to differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below. Furthermore, this discussion does not address any aspect of United States federal non-income tax laws, such as gift, estate or Medicare contribution tax laws, or state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        We have not sought, and will not seek, a ruling from the IRS as to any United States federal income tax consequence described herein. The IRS may disagree with the discussion herein, and its determination may be upheld by a court. Moreover, there can be no assurance that future legislation, regulations, administrative rulings or court decisions will not change the accuracy of the statements in this discussion. 
        As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants who or that is for United States federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) that is created or organized (or treated as created or organized) in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) a trust if  (A) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (B) it has in effect a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person. 
        This discussion does not consider the tax treatment of partnerships or other pass-through entities or persons who hold our securities through such entities. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our securities, the United States federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships holding our securities and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their own tax advisors. 
        THIS DISCUSSION IS ONLY A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES. EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IN OUR SECURITIES IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO SUCH INVESTOR OF THE ACQUISITION, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, AND NON-U.S. TAX LAWS. 
           Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit 
        No statutory, administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for United States federal income tax purposes, and therefore, that treatment is not entirely clear. The acquisition of a unit should be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our Class A ordinary shares and one-half of one warrant, a whole one of which is exercisable to acquire one share of our Class A ordinary shares. We intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and, by purchasing a unit, you must adopt such treatment for tax purposes. For United States federal income tax purposes, each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one Class A ordinary share and the one-half of one warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance. The price allocated to each Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant should be the shareholder’s tax basis in such share or warrant. Any disposition of a unit should be treated for United States federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the Class A ordinary share and one-half of one warrant comprising the unit, and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the Class A ordinary share and warrant based on their respective relative fair market values. The separation of the Class A ordinary share and the one-half of one warrant constituting a unit should not be a taxable event for United States federal income tax purposes. 
        The foregoing treatment of the Class A ordinary shares and warrants and a holder’s purchase price allocation are not binding on the IRS or the courts. Because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units, no assurance can be given that the IRS or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below. Accordingly, each prospective investor is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit (including alternative characterizations of a unit). The balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for United States federal income tax purposes.

           U.S. Holders 
        Taxation of Distributions 
        Subject to the passive foreign investment company (“PFIC”) rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include in gross income as dividends the amount of any cash distribution paid on our Class A ordinary shares to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under United States federal income tax principles). Such dividends paid by us will be taxable to a corporate U.S. Holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to domestic corporations in respect of dividends received from other domestic corporations. Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, distributions in excess of such earnings and profits generally will be applied against and reduce the U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A ordinary shares (but not below zero) and, to the extent in excess of such basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such Class A ordinary shares. 
        With respect to non-corporate U.S. Holders, under tax laws currently in effect, dividends generally will be taxed at the lower applicable long-term capital gains rate (see “Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants” below) only if our Class A ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States and certain other requirements are met. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of such lower rate for any dividends paid with respect to our Class A ordinary shares. 
        Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants 
        Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other taxable disposition of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants (including on our dissolution and liquidation if we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required time period). Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S.Holder’s holding period for such Class A ordinary shares or warrants exceeds one year. It is unclear, however, whether certain redemption rights described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose. 
        The amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition generally will be equal to the difference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition (or, if the Class A ordinary shares or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the Class A ordinary shares or warrants based upon the then fair market values of the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the units) and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A ordinary shares or warrants so disposed of. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its Class A ordinary shares generally will equal the U.S.Holder’s acquisition cost (that is, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of Class A ordinary shares or one-half of one warrant, as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) reduced by any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder is currently eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. See “— Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant” below for a discussion regarding a U.S. Holder’s basis in a Class A ordinary share acquired pursuant to the exercise of a warrant. The deduction of capital losses is subject to certain limitations. 
        Redemption of Class A Ordinary Shares 
        Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, in the event that a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares are redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under “Description of Securities — Ordinary Shares” or if we purchase a U.S. Holder’s Class A ordinary shares in an open market transaction, the treatment of the transaction for United States federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the Class A ordinary shares under Section 302 of the Code. If the redemption or purchase by us qualifies as a sale of Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as described under “Gain or Loss on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Class A Ordinary Shares and Warrants” above. If the redemption or purchase by us does not qualify as a 
      
      
        142
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        sale of Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under “Taxation of Distributions.” Whether a redemption or purchase by us qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of our shares treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any shares constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning warrants) relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after such redemption or purchase. The redemption or purchase by us of Class A ordinary shares generally will be treated as a sale of the Class A ordinary shares (rather than as a corporate distribution) if such redemption or purchase (i) is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a “complete termination” of the U.S.Holder’s interest in us or (iii) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below. 
        In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only our shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also our shares that are constructively owned by such holder. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to shares owned directly, shares owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any shares the U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include Class A ordinary shares which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of Class A ordinary shares must, among other requirements, be less than 80 percent of the percentage of our outstanding voting shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder’s interest if either (i) all of our shares actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii) all of our shares actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of shares owned by certain family members and the U.S.Holder does not constructively own any other shares of ours. The redemption of the Class A ordinary shares will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. Holder’s conversion results in a “meaningful reduction” of the U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder’s proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority shareholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a “meaningful reduction.” A U.S. Holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption. 
        If none of the foregoing tests are satisfied, then the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution and the tax effects will be as described under “Taxation of Distributions” above. After the application of those rules, any remaining tax basis of the U.S. Holder in the redeemed Class A ordinary shares will be added to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its remaining shares, or, if it has none, to the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other shares constructively owned by such holder. 
        Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant 
        Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below and except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant, a U.S. Holder generally will not recognize gain or loss upon the acquisition of a Class A ordinary share on the exercise of a warrant for cash. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Class A ordinary share received upon exercise of the warrant generally will equal the sum of the U.S. Holder’s initial investment in the warrant (that is, the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) and the exercise price. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant; in either case, the holding period will not include the period during which the U.S.Holder held the warrant. If a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holder’s tax basis in the warrant. 
        The tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current law. A cashless exercise may not be taxable, either because the exercise is not a realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for United States federal income tax purposes. In either situation, a U.S.
      
      
        143
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Holder’s tax basis in the Class A ordinary shares received generally would equal the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the warrants. If the cashless exercise was not a realization event, it is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share will commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. If the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization, the holding period of the Class A ordinary shares would include the holding period of the warrants. 
        It is also possible that a cashless exercise may be treated as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized. In such event, a U.S. Holder may be deemed to have surrendered warrants with an aggregate fair market value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised. The U.S. Holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the warrants deemed surrendered and the U.S. Holder’s tax basis in such warrants. In this case, a U.S. Holder’s tax basis in the Class A ordinary shares received would equal the sum of the U.S.Holder’s initial investment in the warrants exercised (i.e., the portion of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the units that is allocated to the warrant, as described above under “— Allocation of Purchase Price and Characterization of a Unit”) and the exercise price of such warrants. It is unclear whether a U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary share would commence on the date of exercise of the warrant or the day following the date of exercise of the warrant. 
        Due to the absence of authority on the United States federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise, there can be no assurance which, if any, of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the IRS or a court of law. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise. 
        Possible Constructive Distributions 
        The terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of Class A ordinary shares for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events, as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned “Description of Securities — Warrants — Public Shareholders’ and Forward Purchase Warrants.” An adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable. The U.S. Holders of the warrants would, however, be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if, for example, the adjustment increases the warrant holders’ proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits (e.g., through an increase in the number of Class A ordinary shares that would be obtained upon exercise) as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of our Class A ordinary shares which is taxable to the U.S. Holders of such Class A ordinary shares as described under “— Taxation of Distributions” above. Such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the U.S. Holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of the increase in the interest. For certain information reporting purposes, we are required to determine the date and amount of any such constructive distributions. Proposed Treasury regulations, which we may rely on prior to the issuance of final regulations, specify how the date and amount of constructive distributions are determined. 
        Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules 
        A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes if either (i) at least 75% of its gross income in a taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, is passive income or (ii) at least 50% of its assets in a taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year), including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, are held for the production of, or produce, passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets.

          Because we are a blank check company, with no current active business, we believe that it is likely that we will meet the PFIC asset or income test for our current taxable year ending December 31, 2018. However, pursuant to a startup exception, a corporation will not be a PFIC for the first taxable year the corporation has gross income (the “startup year”), if  (1) no predecessor of the corporation was a PFIC; (2) the corporation satisfies the IRS that it will not be a PFIC for either of the first two taxable years

          following the startup year; and (3) the corporation is not in fact a PFIC for either of those years. Although subject to uncertainty, we may qualify for the startup exception for 2018, and, accordingly, we would not be treated as a PFIC for 2018. The applicability of the startup exception to us will not be known until after the close of our current taxable year ending December 31, 2018 and, perhaps, until after the close of the first two taxable years following our startup year (within the meaning of the startup exception). Although subject to uncertainty, it is possible that we could be treated as a PFIC for a taxable year prior to our startup year (within the meaning of the startup exception). Further, after the acquisition of a company or assets in a business combination, we may still meet one of the PFIC tests depending on the timing of the acquisition and the amount of our passive income and assets as well as the passive income and assets of the acquired business. If the company that we acquire in a business combination is a PFIC, then we will likely not qualify for the startup exception and will be a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December 31, 2018. Our actual PFIC status for our current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year, however, will not be determinable until after the end of such taxable year. Accordingly, there can be no assurance with respect to our status as a PFIC for our current taxable year ending December 31, 2018 or any future taxable year.

        Although our PFIC status is determined annually, an initial determination that our company is a PFIC will generally apply for subsequent years to a U.S. Holder who held Class A ordinary shares or warrants while we were a PFIC, whether or not we meet the test for PFIC status in those subsequent years. If we are determined to be a PFIC for any taxable year (or portion thereof) that is included in the holding period of a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants and, in the case of our Class A ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder did not make either a timely qualified electing fund (“QEF”) election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder held (or was deemed to hold) Class A ordinary shares, as described below, such U.S. Holder generally will be subject to special rules with respect to (i) any gain recognized by the U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of its Class A ordinary shares or warrants and (ii) any “excess distribution” made to the U.S. Holder (generally, any distributions to such U.S. Holder during a taxable year of the U.S. Holder that are greater than 125% of the average annual distributions received by such U.S. Holder in respect of the Class A ordinary shares during the three preceding taxable years of such U.S. Holder or, if shorter, such U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary shares). 
        Under these rules: 
        •
        the U.S. Holder’s gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over the U.S. Holder’s holding period for the Class A ordinary shares or warrants; 
        ​
        •
        the amount allocated to the U.S. Holder’s taxable year in which the U.S. Holder recognized the gain or received the excess distribution, or to the period in the U.S. Holder’s holding period before the first day of our first taxable year in which we are a PFIC, will be taxed as ordinary income; 
        ​
        •
        the amount allocated to other taxable years (or portions thereof) of the U.S. Holder and included in its holding period will be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for that year and applicable to the U.S. Holder; and 
        ​
        •
        an additional tax equal to the interest charge generally applicable to underpayments of tax will be imposed on the U.S. Holder with respect to the tax attributable to each such other taxable year of the U.S. Holder. 
        ​
        In general, if we are determined to be a PFIC, a U.S. Holder will avoid the PFIC tax consequences described above in respect to our Class A ordinary shares (but not our warrants) by making a timely and valid QEF election (if eligible to do so) to include in income its pro rata share of our net capital gains (as long-term capital gain) and other earnings and profits (as ordinary income), on a current basis, in each case whether or not distributed, in the taxable year of the U.S. Holder in which or with which our taxable year ends. A U.S. Holder generally may make a separate election to defer the payment of taxes on undistributed income inclusions under the QEF rules, but if deferred, any such taxes will be subject to an interest charge. 
        A U.S. Holder may not make a QEF election with respect to its warrants to acquire our Class A ordinary shares. As a result, if a U.S. Holder sells or otherwise disposes of such warrants (other than upon exercise of such warrants) and we were a PFIC at any time during the U.S. Holder’s holding period of such warrants, any gain recognized generally will be treated as an excess distribution, taxed as described above. If 
      
      
        145
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        a U.S. Holder that exercises such warrants properly makes a QEF election with respect to the newly acquired Class A ordinary shares (or has previously made a QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares), the QEF election will apply to the newly acquired Class A ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adverse tax consequences relating to PFIC shares, adjusted to take into account the current income inclusions resulting from the QEF election, will continue to apply with respect to such newly acquired Class A ordinary shares (which generally will be deemed to have a holding period for purposes of the PFIC rules that includes the period the U.S. Holder held the warrants), unless the U.S.Holder makes a purging election under the PFIC rules. Under the purging election, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to have sold such shares at their fair market value and any gain recognized on such deemed sale will be treated as an excess distribution, as described above. As a result of the purging election, the U.S. Holder will have a new basis and holding period in the Class A ordinary shares acquired upon the exercise of the warrants for purposes of the PFIC rules. 
        The QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and, once made, can be revoked only with the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder generally makes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621 (Information Return by a Shareholder of a Passive Foreign Investment Company or Qualified Electing Fund), including the information provided in a PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed United States federal income tax return for the tax year to which the election relates. Retroactive QEF elections generally may be made only by filing a protective statement with such return and if certain other conditions are met or with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a retroactive QEF election under their particular circumstances. 
        In order to comply with the requirements of a QEF election, a U.S. Holder must receive a PFIC annual information statement from us. If we determine we are a PFIC for any taxable year (of which there can be no assurance), we will endeavor to provide to a U.S. Holder such information as the IRS may require, including a PFIC annual information statement, in order to enable the U.S. Holder to make and maintain a QEF election, but there is no assurance that we will timely provide such required information. There is also no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of our status as a PFIC in the future or of the required information to be provided. 
        If a U.S. Holder has made a QEF election with respect to our Class A ordinary shares, and the excess distribution rules discussed above do not apply to such shares (because of a timely QEF election for our first taxable year as a PFIC in which the U.S. Holder holds (or is deemed to hold) such shares or a purge of the PFIC taint pursuant to a purging election, as described above), any gain recognized on the sale of our Class A ordinary shares generally will be taxable as capital gain and no additional tax charge will be imposed under the PFIC rules. As discussed above, if we are a PFIC for any taxable year, a U.S. Holder of our Class A ordinary shares that has made a QEF election will be currently taxed on its pro rata share of our earnings and profits, whether or not distributed for such year. A subsequent distribution of such earnings and profits that were previously included in income generally should not be taxable when distributed to such U.S. Holder. The tax basis of a U.S. Holder’s shares in a QEF will be increased by amounts that are included in income, and decreased by amounts distributed but not taxed as dividends, under the above rules. In addition, if we are not a PFIC for any taxable year, such U.S. Holder will not be subject to the QEF inclusion regime with respect to our Class A ordinary shares for such a taxable year. 
        If we are a PFIC and our Class A ordinary shares constitute “marketable stock,” a U.S. Holder may avoid the adverse PFIC tax consequences discussed above if such U.S. Holder, at the close of the first taxable year in which it holds (or is deemed to hold) our Class A ordinary shares, makes a mark-to-market election with respect to such shares for such taxable year. Such U.S. Holder generally will include for each of its taxable years as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of its Class A ordinary shares at the end of such year over its adjusted basis in its Class A ordinary shares. The U.S. Holder also will recognize an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of its adjusted basis of its Class A ordinary shares over the fair market value of its Class A ordinary shares at the end of its taxable year (but only to the extent of the net amount of previously included income as a result of the mark-to-market election). The U.S. Holder’s basis in its Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss amounts, and any further gain recognized on a sale or other taxable disposition of its Class A ordinary shares will be treated as ordinary income. Currently, a mark-to-market election may not be made with respect to warrants. 
      
      
        146
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        The mark-to-market election is available only for “marketable stock,” generally, stock that is regularly traded on a national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the NYSE (on which we intend to list the Class A ordinary shares), or on a foreign exchange or market that the IRS determines has rules sufficient to ensure that the market price represents a legitimate and sound fair market value. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability and tax consequences of a mark-to-market election in respect to our Class A ordinary shares under their particular circumstances. 
        If we are a PFIC and, at any time, have a foreign subsidiary that is classified as a PFIC, U.S. Holders generally would be deemed to own a portion of the shares of such lower-tier PFIC, and generally could incur liability for the deferred tax and interest charge described above if we receive a distribution from, or dispose of all or part of our interest in, the lower-tier PFIC or the U.S. Holders otherwise were deemed to have disposed of an interest in the lower-tier PFIC. We will endeavor to cause any lower-tier PFIC to provide to a U.S. Holder the information that may be required to make or maintain a QEF election with respect to the lower-tier PFIC. There can be no assurance that we will have timely knowledge of the status of any such lower-tier PFIC. In addition, we may not hold a controlling interest in any such lower-tier PFIC and thus there can be no assurance we will be able to cause the lower-tier PFIC to provide such required information. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the tax issues raised by lower-tier PFICs. 
        A U.S. Holder that owns (or is deemed to own) shares in a PFIC during any taxable year of the U.S.Holder, may have to file an IRS Form 8621 (whether or not a QEF or mark-to-market election is made) and such other information as may be required by the U.S. Treasury Department. Failure to do so, if required, will extend the statute of limitations until such required information is furnished to the IRS. 
        The rules dealing with PFICs and with the QEF and mark-to-market elections are very complex and are affected by various factors in addition to those described above. Accordingly, U.S. Holders of our Class A ordinary shares and warrants should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of the PFIC rules to our securities under their particular circumstances. 
        Tax Reporting 
        Certain U.S. Holders may be required to file an IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation) to report a transfer of property (including cash) to us. Substantial penalties may be imposed on a U.S. Holder that fails to comply with this reporting requirement. Furthermore, certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and certain entities will be required to report information with respect to such U.S. Holder’s investment in “specified foreign financial assets” on IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets), subject to certain exceptions. An interest in the Company constitutes a specified foreign financial asset for these purposes. Persons who are required to report specified foreign financial assets and fail to do so may be subject to substantial penalties. Potential investors are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the foreign financial asset and other reporting obligations and their application to an investment in our Class A ordinary shares and warrants. 
           Non-U.S. Holders 
        This section applies to you if you are a “Non-U.S. Holder.” As used herein, the term “Non-U.S.Holder” means a beneficial owner of our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
        •
        a non-resident alien individual (other than certain former citizens and residents of the United States subject to U.S. tax as expatriates); 
        ​
        •
        a foreign corporation; or 
        ​
        •
        an estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder; 
        ​
        but generally does not include an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition. If you are such an individual, you should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of our securities.

      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
        Dividends (including constructive distributions) paid or deemed paid to a Non-U.S. Holder in respect of our Class A ordinary shares generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax, unless the dividends are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains in the United States). In addition, a Non-U.S.Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain attributable to a sale or other disposition of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants unless such gain is effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base that such holder maintains in the United States). 
        Dividends (including constructive distributions) and gains that are effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, are attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States) generally will be subject to United States federal income tax at the same regular United States federal income tax rates applicable to a comparable U.S. Holder and, in the case of a Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or a lower applicable tax treaty rate. 
        The United States federal income tax treatment of a Non-U.S. Holder’s exercise of a warrant, or the lapse of a warrant held by a Non-U.S. Holder, generally will correspond to the United States federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a U.S. Holder, as described under “U.S. Holders — Exercise or Lapse of a Warrant,” above, although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange, the consequences would be similar to those described in the preceding paragraphs above for a Non-U.S. Holder’s gain on the sale or other disposition of our Class A ordinary shares and warrants. 
           Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
        Dividend payments with respect to our Class A ordinary shares and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of our Class A ordinary shares may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and possible United States backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a U.S. Holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes other required certifications, or who is otherwise exempt from backup withholding and establishes such exempt status. A Non-U.S. Holder generally will eliminate the requirement for information reporting and backup withholding by providing certification of its foreign status, under penalties of perjury, on a duly executed applicable IRS Form W-8 or by otherwise establishing an exemption. 
        Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, and a holder generally may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely filing the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding and the availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding in their particular circumstances.

        The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated to purchase all the units in the offering if any are purchased, other than those units covered by the over-allotment option described below. 
        We have granted to the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase on a pro rata basis up to 4,500,000 additional units at the initial public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The option may be exercised only to cover any over-allotments of units. 
        The underwriters propose to offer the units initially at the public offering price on the cover page of this prospectus and to selling group members at that price less a selling concession of  $      per unit. The underwriters and the selling group members may allow a discount of  $      per unit on sales to other broker/dealers. After the initial public offering the underwriters may change the public offering price and concession and discount to broker/dealers.

          We, our sponsor and our officers and directors have agreed that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, any units, warrants, ordinary shares or any other securities convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, ordinary shares; provided, however, that we may (1) issue and sell the private placement warrants, (2) issue and sell the additional units to cover our underwriters’ over-allotment option (if any), (3) register with the SEC pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into concurrently with the closing of this offering, the resale of the private placement warrants and

          the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and the founder shares, and (4) issue securities in connection with our initial business combination. Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated in their sole discretion may release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time without notice. 


          Our initial shareholders (other than our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the closing of our initial business combination or (B) subsequent to our initial business combination, if  (x) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after our initial business combination, or (y) we complete a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property; and our sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any sponsor-affiliate have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their founder shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) the third anniversary of the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the waiver of the foregoing restrictions by anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares (except with respect to permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). Any permitted transferees would be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of our initial shareholders with respect to any founder shares. In addition, our sponsor and the BSOF Entities have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which our sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares. 


          The private placement warrants (including the Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination (except with respect to permitted transferees as described herein under “Principal Shareholders — Transfers of Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants”). 

        We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in that respect. 

          We expect our units to be listed on the NYSE, under the symbol “OMAD.U” and, once the Class A ordinary shares and warrants begin separate trading, to have our Class A ordinary shares and warrants listed on the NYSE under the symbols “OMAD” and “OMAD.W,” respectively. 

        Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our securities. 
        The determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company. Among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies, prior offerings of those companies, our management, our capital structure, and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets, including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company. We cannot assure you, however, that the price at which the units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our units, Class A ordinary shares or warrants will develop and continue after this offering. 
        If we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, the trustee and the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any rights or claims to their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon, then in the trust account; and (ii) the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions will be distributed on a pro rata basis, together with any accrued interest thereon (which interest shall be net of taxes payable by us) to the public shareholders. 
        In connection with this offering, the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.

        •
        Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. 
        ​
        •
        Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of units in excess of the number of units the underwriters are obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of units over-allotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of units that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short position, the number of units involved is greater than the number of units in the over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or purchasing units in the open market. 
        ​
        •
        Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of units to close out the short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the over-allotment option. If the underwriters sell more units than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position can only be closed out by buying units in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. 
        ​
        •
        Penalty bids permit the representatives to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the units originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. 
        ​

          These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our units or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the units. As a result the price of our units may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. These transactions may be effected on the NYSE or otherwise and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. 

        We are not under any contractual obligation to engage any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering, and have no present intent to do so. However, any of the underwriters may introduce us to potential target businesses or assist us in raising additional capital in the future. If any of the underwriters provide services to us after this offering, we may pay such underwriter fair and reasonable fees that would be determined at that time in an arm’s length negotiation; provided that no agreement will be entered into with any of the underwriters and no fees for such services will be paid to any of the underwriters prior to the date that is 90 days from the date of this prospectus, unless FINRA determines that such payment would not be deemed underwriters’ compensation in connection with this offering and we may pay the underwriters of this offering or any entity with which they are affiliated a finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us in connection with the completion of a business combination. 
        Some of the underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with us or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions. 
        In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

          To the Board of Directors and Shareholder of One Madison Corporation


          We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of One Madison Corporation (the ‘‘Company’’), as of September 30, 2017, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholder’s equity and cash flows for the period from July 13, 2017 (date of inception) to September 30, 2017. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


          We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


          In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position One Madison Corporation as of September 30, 2017 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from July 13, 2017 (date of inception) to September 30, 2017, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

        One Madison Corporation
        Notes to Financial Statements
        NOTE 1.   DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS 

          One Madison Corporation (the “Company”) is a newly incorporated blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2017. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses that the Company has not yet identified (“Initial Business Combination”). Although the Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating its Initial Business Combination, the Company intends to focus on North American or Western European Consumer Products related businesses with a particular sub-focus on companies in one of the following categories: (i) consumer products or services, (ii) food and beverage and (iii) adjacent manufacturing or industrial services businesses linked to a consumer end-user. The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the “Securities Act,” as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). 


          At September 30, 2017, the Company had not yet commenced operations. All activity for the period from July 13, 2017 (date of inception) through September 30, 2017 relates to the Company’s formation and the proposed initial public offering (“Proposed Offering”) described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of its Initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Proposed Offering. The Company has selected December 31st as its fiscal year end. 


          The Company’s ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through a proposed initial public offering of 30,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit (or 34,500,000 units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) (“Units” and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the “Public Shares”) which is discussed in Note 3 (the “Proposed Offering”) and the sale of 8,000,000 warrants (or 8,900,000 warrants if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of  $1.00 per warrant in a private placement to the Company’s founder, Omar M. Asali, the other Anchor Investors (as defined below) and certain entities affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. (the “BSOF Entities”) that will close simultaneously with the Proposed Offering. Upon the closing of the Proposed Offering, management has agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.00 per Unit sold in the Proposed Offering, including the proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (“Trust Account”) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of the Initial Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as described below. The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of its Proposed Offering and Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating an Initial Business Combination. The Company’s Initial Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the Initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete an Initial Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. 

        The Company will provide its shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of an Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of an Initial Business Combination 
      
      
        F-7
      
      
    
    
      TABLE OF CONTENTS
      
         

          or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially approximately $10.00 per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). The per-share amount to be distributed to public shareholders who redeem their Public Shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriter (as discussed in Note 6). These Public Shares will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Offering, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” In such case, the Company will proceed with an Initial Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of an Initial Business Combination and a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Initial Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by the law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing an Initial Business Combination. If, however, a shareholder approval of the transactions is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or legal reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. Additionally, each public shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the initial shareholders (as defined below) have agreed to vote their Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) (subject to restrictions on voting applicable to one of the initial shareholders) and other than the BSOF Entities, any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Offering in favor of an Initial Business Combination. In addition, the initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and, with respect to our initial shareholders other than the Anchor Investors (as defined below) and the BSOF Entities, Public Shares in connection with the completion of an Initial Business Combination. 

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. 

          The Company’s sponsor, One Madison Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”), the BSOF Entities and the Anchor Investors, together with any permitted transferees (collectively, the “initial shareholders”), have agreed not to propose an amendment to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association that would affect the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete an Initial Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Class A ordinary shares in conjunction with any such amendment. 

        If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within 24 months from the closing of the Proposed Offering (the “Combination Period”), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. 
        In connection with the redemption of 100% of the Company’s outstanding Public Shares for a portion of the funds held in the Trust Account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not 
      
      
        F-8

        previously released to the Company to pay the Company’s taxes payable (less taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). 
        The initial shareholders have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete an Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the initial shareholders should acquire Public Shares in or after the Proposed Offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such Public Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within in the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Company’s Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the residual assets remaining available for distribution (including Trust Account assets) will be only $10.00 per share initially held in the Trust Account. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, our Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account or to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriter of the Proposed Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that our Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Company’s independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.
        NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
        Basis of presentation 

          The accompanying financial statements of the Company are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In connection with the Company’s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, “Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern”, as of September 30, 2017, the Company does not have sufficient liquidity to meet its current obligations. However, management has determined that the Company has access to funds from the Sponsor entity that are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of the Company until the earlier of the consummation of the Proposed Offering or a minimum one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements. 

        Emerging growth company 

          The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the “Securities Act”), as modified by the JOBS Act, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

        Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities

        registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used. 
        Use of estimates 
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
        Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near-term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
        Concentration of credit risk 

          Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution which, at times may exceed the Federal depository insurance coverage of $250,000. At September 30, 2017, the Company had not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account. 

        Fair value of financial instruments 
        The fair value of the Company’s assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures” approximates the carrying amounts represented in the accompanying balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. 
        Deferred offering costs 

          The Company complies with the requirements of FASB ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) Topic 5A — “Expenses of Offering.” Deferred offering costs of  $630,175, consist of costs incurred in connection with preparation for the Proposed Offering. These costs, together with the underwriter discount, will be charged to capital upon completion of the Proposed Offering or charged to operations if the Proposed Offering is not completed. 

        Income taxes 
        The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

          FASB ASC Topic 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company’s management determined that the Cayman Islands is the Company’s only major tax jurisdiction. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2017. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. 

        The Company may be subject to potential examination by U.S. federal, U.S. states or foreign taxing authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with U.S.federal, U.S. state and foreign tax laws. The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months. 
        Net loss per share 

          Net loss per ordinary share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, plus, to the extent dilutive, the incremental number of ordinary shares to settle warrants, as calculated using the treasury stock method. Weighted average shares was reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 1,125,000 ordinary shares that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters. In addition, weighted average shares was reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 2,250,000 ordinary shares that are subject to forfeiture upon failure to satisfy certain earnout conditions as defined in the Securities Subscription Agreement, as amended, and the Strategic Partnership Agreement. These shares subject to earnout conditions consist of 157,500 shares initially held by the BSOF Entities and 2,092,500 shares initially held by the Sponsor. At September 30, 2017, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted loss per ordinary share is the same as basic loss per ordinary share for the period. 

        Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

          The Company’s management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. 

        NOTE 3.   PROPOSED OFFERING 
        Pursuant to the Proposed Offering, the Company will offer for sale up to 30,000,000 Units (or 34,500,000 Units if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at a purchase price of  $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit will consist of one Class A ordinary share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of  $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). 
        NOTE 4.   PRIVATE PLACEMENT 

          The Anchor Investors and the BSOF Entities are expected to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 Private Placement Warrants (or 8,900,000 Private Placement Warrants if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in full), of which Mr. Asali is expected to purchase 2,006,041 (or 2,153,747 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full), at $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of the Proposed Offering. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless.

        NOTE 5.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
        Founder Shares 

          On July 18, 2017, the Company issued 8,625,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”) to the Sponsor in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000. This number includes an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters (Note 8). Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company has issued 3,750,000 Founder Shares to certain investors, including Mr. Asali and the Company’s other executive officers, (collectively, the “Anchor Investors”), for $0.01 per share in connection with the forward purchase agreements prior to the offering. The Sponsor currently owns 8,100,000 Class B ordinary shares, following the transfer of 525,000 Founder Shares to the BSOF Entities. The Founder Shares will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) upon the consummation of an Initial Business Combination at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Founder Shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of   (i) the total number of Public Shares, plus (ii) the sum of   (a) the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (including forward purchase shares, but not forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the Initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, minus (b) the number of Public Shares redeemed by Public Shareholders in connection with the Initial Business Combination. 


          The Sponsor, its controlled affiliates and any director, officer or employee of the Sponsor who is also serving in any such role or position at the Company, including Mr. Asali (each, a “sponsor-affiliate” provided that such term does not refer to any of the Company’s non-executive directors), have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (a) the third anniversary after the completion of the Initial Business Combination or (b) the waiver of such restrictions on transfer by Anchor Investors representing over 50.0% of the Forward Purchase Shares (except to certain permitted transferees and subject to certain exceptions). The initial shareholders (other than the Sponsor, its controlled affiliates or any sponsor-affiliate) have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of their Founder Shares and any Class A ordinary shares or Class C shares issued upon conversion thereof until the earlier to occur of: (i) one year after the completion of the Initial Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction after the Initial Business Combination that results in all of the Company’s ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property (except to certain permitted transferees and subject to certain exceptions). Any permitted transferees will be subject to the same restrictions and other agreements of the initial shareholders with respect to any Founder Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after the Initial Business Combination, the Founder Shares held by the initial shareholders (other than the Sponsor’s and BSOF Entities’ Founder Shares that are subject to the earnout condition in the Securities Subscription Agreement, between the Company and the Sponsor, as amended, and the Strategic Partnership Agreement) will be released from the lock-up. 

        Promissory Note — Related Party 

          The Sponsor has agreed to loan the Company up to $200,000 to be used for the payment of costs related to the Proposed Offering. The loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of the Proposed Offering. The Company intends to repay the loan from the proceeds of the Proposed Offering not being placed in the Trust Account. As of September 30, 2017, there were $91,993 of outstanding borrowings under the promissory note of which $5,993 represented formation costs paid directly by the Sponsor. As of January 2, 2018, there were $92,844 of outstanding borrowings under the promissory note.

        Administrative Service Fee 
        The Company has agreed, commencing on the effective date of the Proposed Offering through the earlier of the Company’s consummation of an Initial Business Combination and its liquidation, to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a monthly fee of  $10,000 for office space, and secretarial and administrative services. 
        Related Party Loans 
        In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an Initial Business Combination, an affiliate of the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (“Working Capital Loans”). If the Company completes an Initial Business Combination, the Company would repay the Working Capital Loans out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, the Working Capital Loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that an Initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans, other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released for working capital purposes. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such Working Capital Loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. The Working Capital Loans would either be repaid upon consummation of an Initial Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of such Working Capital Loans may be convertible into warrants of the post Business Combination entity at a price of  $1.00 per warrant. The warrants would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. 
        NOTE 6.   COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES 
        Registration Rights 

          The holders of the Founder Shares and Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be entered into concurrently with the closing of the Proposed Offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not permit any registration statement filed under the Securities Act to become effective until termination of the applicable lock-up period. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. 

        Underwriting Agreement 
        The Company will grant the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of this prospectus to purchase up to 4,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Proposed Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. 
        The underwriter will be entitled to an underwriting discount of $0.20 per unit, or $6,000,000 in the aggregate (or $6,900,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Proposed Offering. $0.35 per unit, or $10,500,000 in the aggregate (or $12,075,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be payable to the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes an Initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement for the offering.

          Class B Ordinary Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of Class B ordinary shares with a par value of  $0.0001 per share. Holders of the Company’s Class B ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. The Company initially issued 8,625,000 Class B ordinary shares on July 18, 2017. This number includes an aggregate of 1,125,000 ordinary shares that are subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised by the underwriters. The Class B ordinary shares and will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (or the Class C ordinary shares, at the election of the holder) on the first business day following the consummation of the Initial Business Combination. The ratio at which Class B ordinary shares will convert into Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares will be such that the number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of   (i) the total number of Public Shares (including any such shares issued following the exercise of the over-allotment option), plus (ii) the sum of  (a) the total number of Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issued or deemed issued or issuable upon conversion or exercise of any equity-linked securities or rights issued or deemed issued, by the Company in connection with or in relation to the consummation of the Initial Business Combination (including forward purchase shares, but not forward purchase warrants), excluding any Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities exercisable for or convertible into Class A ordinary shares issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the Initial Business Combination and any Private Placement Warrants issued to the Sponsor upon conversion of Working Capital Loans, minus (b) the number of Public Shares redeemed by Public Shareholders in connection with the Initial Business Combination. 


          Class C Ordinary Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of Class C ordinary shares with a par value of  $0.0001 per share. Following the consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination, each issued Class C Share shall be converted into one Class A Share, subject to any necessary adjustments for any share splits, capitalizations, consolidations or similar transactions occurring in respect of the Class A Shares or the Class C Shares, (i) upon receipt by the Company of 65 days’ notice in writing from the registered holder of such Class C ordinary share to convert such Class C ordinary share, or (ii) automatically upon the transfer by the registered holder of such Class C ordinary share, whether or not for value, to a third party, except for transfers to a nominee or “affiliate” (as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of such holder in a transfer that will not result in a change in beneficial ownership or to a person that already holds Class A ordinary shares. At September 30, 2017, there are no Class C ordinary shares issued or outstanding. 

        Holders of Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders except as required by law. The holders of Class C ordinary shares will not have the right to vote in general meetings of the Company.

          In December 2017, the Company amended the Securities Subscription Agreement dated July 18, 2017 to include an “earnout” clause which requires the forfeiture of certain Founder Shares by the Sponsor under certain circumstances as described in the agreement. In December 2017, the Company and the Sponsor entered into the Strategic Partnership Agreement with the BSOF Entities which provides for, among other things, a similar “earnout” clause which requires the forfeiture of certain Founder Shares by the BSOF Entities under certain circumstances as described in the agreement. These shares will be subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor and the BSOF Entities on the fifth anniversary of the Initial Business Combination unless following the Initial Business Combination, either (A) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares (or any successor class of ordinary shares or common shares) equals or exceeds, in the case of the Sponsor, $12.50 per share and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period or (B) the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for consideration in cash, securities or other property which equals or exceeds, in the case of the Sponsor, $12.50 per share, and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) (each, an “earnout condition”). The number of earnout shares subject to forfeiture will initially be 2,250,000. In

          connection with the earnout clause, the Sponsor and the BSOF Entities have also agreed to not transfer, assign or sell any of their earnout shares until the earlier of  (i) the date on which one or more of the earnout conditions has been satisfied and (ii) the date on which the Sponsor and the BSOF Entities forfeit the earnout shares.


          Preference Shares — The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 preference shares with a par value of  $0.0001 per share. At September 30, 2017, there are no preference shares issued or outstanding. 


          Warrants — Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of   (a) 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination or (b) 12 months from the closing of the Proposed Offering; provided in each case that the Company has an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available (or the Company permits holders to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis and such cashless exercise is exempt from registration under the Securities Act). The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 30 business days, after the closing of the Initial Business Combination, the Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the Public Warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the sixtieth (60th) day after the closing of the Initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of the Initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 


          The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Proposed Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Placement Warrants will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial Anchor Investors and the BSOF Entities who purchased such warrants or their respective permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than such Anchor Investors, the BSOF Entities or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 

        The Company may call the Public Warrants for redemption (except with respect to the Private Placement Warrants): 
        •
        in whole and not in part; 
        ​
        •
        at a price of $0.01 per warrant; 
        ​
        •
        upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption; and 
        ​

          •
          if, and only if, the last reported closing price of the public shares equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 
          ​

        If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. 
        The exercise price and number of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares, as applicable, issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a share dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the warrants will not

        be adjusted for issuance of Class A ordinary shares or Class C ordinary shares at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants shares. If the Company is unable to complete an Initial Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 
        NOTE 8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

          In October 2017, the Company entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which certain investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares (collectively, the “Forward Purchase Shares”), plus an aggregate of 5,000,000 redeemable warrants (the “Forward Purchase Warrants”), for an aggregate purchase price of $10.00 per Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share, as applicable, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of the Initial Business Combination. In connection with these agreements, the Company issued to such investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 Founder Shares for $0.01 per share. The Founder Shares issued to such investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the Founder Shares issued to the Sponsor. The Anchor Investors will have redemption rights with respect to any Public Shares they own. The forward purchase agreements also provide that the investors are entitled to a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans that are convertible into Private Placement Warrants) by the Company for capital raising purposes, or if the Company offers or seeks commitments for any equity or equity-linked securities to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with the closing of the Initial Business Combination (other than the Units the Company is offering by this prospectus and their component Public Shares and Public Warrants, the Founder Shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for which such Founder Shares are convertible), the Forward Purchase Shares, the Forward Purchase Warrant and the Private Placement Warrants) and registration rights with respect to the (A) Forward Purchase Shares, Forward Purchase Warrants, and Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying their Forward Purchase Warrants and their Founder Shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants acquired by the Anchor Investors, including any time after we complete our Initial Business Combination. The Class C ordinary shares have identical terms as the Class A ordinary shares, except the Class C ordinary shares do not grant their holders any voting rights. The amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that the Class C ordinary shares may be converted into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder with 65 days written notice or upon the transfer of such Class C ordinary shares to a non-affiliate of the holder.


          In December 2017, the Company amended the Securities Subscription Agreement dated July 18, 2017 to include an “earnout” clause which requires the forfeiture of certain Founder Shares by the Sponsor under certain circumstances as described in the agreement. In December 2017, the Company and the Sponsor entered into the Strategic Partnership Agreement with the BSOF Entities which provides for, among other things, a similar “earnout” clause which requires the forfeiture of certain Founder Shares by the BSOF Entities under certain circumstances as described in the agreement. These shares will be subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor and the BSOF Entities on the fifth anniversary of the Initial Business Combination unless following the Initial Business Combination, either (A) the closing price of the Class A ordinary shares (or any successor class of ordinary shares or common shares) equals or exceeds, in the case of the Sponsor, $12.50 per share and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30 consecutive trading day period or (B) the Company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the ordinary shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for consideration in cash, securities or other property which equals or exceeds, in the case of the Sponsor, $12.50 per share, and in the case of the BSOF Entities, $12.25 per share (in each case as adjusted for share splits, dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) (each, an“earnout condition”). The number of earnout shares subject to forfeiture will initially be 2,250,000. In

          Item 14.   Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 


          Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company’s memorandum and articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against willful default, willful neglect, civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association will provide for indemnification of our officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by law, including for any liability incurred in their capacities as such, except through their own actual fraud, willful default or willful neglect. We may purchase a policy of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directors. 


          Our officers and directors have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the trust account, and have agreed to waive any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any services provided to us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will only be able to be satisfied by us if  (i) we have sufficient funds outside of the trust account or (ii) we consummate an initial business combination. 


          Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 


          Item 15.   Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities. 


          On July 18, 2017, One Madison Group LLC, our sponsor, were issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 of our Class B ordinary shares (up to 1,125,000 of which are subject to forfeiture depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised), which were issued in exchange for a capital contribution of  $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Such securities were issued in connection with

        our organization pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. On October 5, 2017, in connection with the execution of the forward purchase agreements, we issued to certain investors (including Mr. Asali), whom we refer to as “anchor investors,” an aggregate of 3,750,000 Class B ordinary shares, in exchange for a capital contribution of  $37,500, or $0.01 per share. The founder shares were sold to the anchor investors in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act as all of the anchor investors are accredited investors under Rule 501 of Regulation D. 
        Mr. Asali, together with his affiliates, holds an 80% ownership interest in our sponsor. Our sponsor is an accredited investor for purposes of Rule 501 of Regulation D. Each of the equity holders in our sponsor is an accredited investor under Rule 501 of Regulation D. The sole business of our sponsor is to act as the company’s sponsor in connection with this offering. 

          The anchor investors, BSOF Master Fund L.P. and BSOF Master Fund II L.P., have committed, pursuant to separate written agreements, to purchase an aggregate of 8,000,000 private placement warrants (or 8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of which Mr. Asali has committed to purchase 2,006,041 (assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option) and the BSOF Entities have committed to purchase 560,000 in the aggregate, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share or Class C ordinary share at $11.50 per share, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant ($8,000,000 in the aggregate or $8,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering. These issuances will be made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

        On October 5, 2017, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to which the anchor investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares, plus an aggregate of 5,000,000 redeemable warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $150,000,000 in a private placement to close concurrently with our initial business combination. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination, and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or amendment, as applicable. 
        No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sales.

        (b)
        Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
