exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option and reflects a 3,250-for-1
stock split of the existing common stock.

                              Mykrolis Corporation

Our Company

   We are a worldwide developer, manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas
delivery systems, components and consumables used to precisely measure,
deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and chemicals, as well
as the deionized water, photoresists and vacuum systems, that are utilized in
the semiconductor manufacturing process. Photoresists are light sensitive
liquid chemicals used to coat semiconductor wafers in order to form a circuit
pattern. In addition, our products are used to manufacture a range of other
products, such as flat panel displays, high purity chemicals, photoresists,
solar cells, gas lasers, optical disks and fiber optic cables.

   We offer thousands of products grouped in 250 product categories, including
more than 2,500 consumable products. Our consumables are those products, such
as filters for liquid and gas processes, that are used by our customers in the
manufacturing process and which require periodic replacement to maintain the
purity and precision of the manufacturing process. Our products use
purification technologies to remove particles, ions and molecules from liquid
or gas streams, as well as electro-mechanical, pressure differential and
related technologies to permit semiconductor and other electronics
manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of liquids, gases
and vacuum systems used in these manufacturing processes. Our specially
designed proprietary filters remove sub-micron sized particles and bubbles from
the different chemical fluid streams, typically liquid or gas, that are used in
the manufacturing process.

   The increasing complexity of semiconductor devices has resulted in the need
for more complex, higher-precision liquid and gas delivery, measurement,
control and purification systems. The ability of semiconductor device
manufacturers to offer integrated circuits with smaller geometries, greater
functionality and higher performance at a lower cost requires continuous
improvements in semiconductor process equipment, process controls and liquid
and gas delivery systems. Manufacturing a semiconductor can require hundreds of
process steps, many of which involve the precise measurement, delivery, control
and purification of process liquids, gases and other chemicals. The design and
performance of those liquid and gas delivery systems, subsystems, components
and consumables are critical to the semiconductor manufacturing process because
they directly affect cost of ownership and manufacturing yield, which is the
ratio of acceptable wafers to total wafers processed.

   As equipment and process complexity in semiconductor manufacturing
increases, semiconductor original equipment manufacturers and device
manufacturers are seeking to improve time-to-market, reduce manufacturing costs
and improve production quality and reliability and long-term service and
support. To address these issues, semiconductor equipment companies and device
manufacturers are outsourcing the design and manufacture of liquid and gas
delivery, measurement, control and purification systems, components and
consumables to us and to other well-established subsystem and component
companies that have worldwide presence and leading technologies.

   We have been selling our filtration products to semiconductor device
manufacturers since 1978, and we believe that we currently offer the most
comprehensive range of filtration, purification, dispense, pressure and vacuum
measurement and control products serving the semiconductor industry. We are an
integrated multinational manufacturer, and we sell our products and services to
semiconductor device manufacturers, as well as to original equipment
manufacturers and materials suppliers to those companies. We have been a
pioneer in the field of filtration and purification products and have been
instrumental in the development of many industry innovations for over two
decades.

   We have an extensive installed base for our products with industry leading
customers worldwide. We sell our products primarily through our direct sales
force located in over 25 offices worldwide, and we currently have manufacturing
facilities in the United States, Japan and England. We are in the process of
relocating the operations of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United
States and downsizing our manufacturing facility in England as part of our
worldwide manufacturing rationalization plan. We anticipate opening a new
manufacturing facility outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and
moving between 10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations from our
existing domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new facility
over the next two to three years. We also have a network of service and support
facilities to serve our customers worldwide.

   Our major customer groups include semiconductor device manufacturers,
semiconductor original equipment manufacturers and gas and chemical materials
companies. Our customers include most major semiconductor device manufacturers
and semiconductor equipment suppliers in the United States, Japan, Taiwan,
Korea and Europe, as well as other electronic device manufacturers. Our most
significant customers based on sales in 2000 include the following industry
leaders:

    Applied Materials, Inc.          Novellus Systems, Inc.
    ASM Lithography Holding N.V.     Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
    Dainippon Screen Manufacturing Co.,
    Ltd.
                                     Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
                                     Co. Ltd.
    FSI International, Inc.          Tokyo Electron Limited
    LAM Research Corporation

   We seek to leverage our longstanding global customer relationships with
semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers and equipment companies
to develop next generation liquid and gas delivery system products and
consumables. We also seek to support our customers' product development,
applications development and service and support needs on a worldwide basis.
Our products are designed to meet all of the liquid, gas and chemical delivery,
control, dispense and purification needs of our customers, which allows
semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers and equipment companies
to outsource the complete design, manufacture, service and support of their
liquid and gas delivery, control, dispense and purification systems to us. Our
competitive strengths include:

  .  demonstrated industry innovation;

  .  technologically advanced products for high-growth markets;

  .  comprehensive product offering;

  .  advanced application development services;

  .  global manufacturing, service and support;

  .  low cost of ownership; and

  .  environmentally conscious products.

   The market for our products is highly fragmented, and our competitive
position varies depending on the market segment and specific product areas
within these segments. For example, other companies have

                                       5
<PAGE>

more established positions in the markets related to gas delivery systems and
components and some of our competitors have cost advantages over us in these
markets due to their larger market share and the related economies of scale. In
addition, while we have longstanding relationships with a number of
semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers, we face significant
competition from companies that have longstanding relationships with other
semiconductor and electronic device manufacturers and, as a result, have been
able to have their products specified by those customers for use in
manufacturers' fabrication facilities. In the markets for our consumable
products, our competitors compete against us on the basis of price as well as
alternative membrane technology having different functionality, manufacturing
capabilities and breadth of geographic presence. Competitors with greater
financial resources may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or
services or other incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors
may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies or devote
more resources to developing new technologies and may be able to adopt more
aggressive pricing policies and undertake more extensive marketing campaigns.

Our Business Strategy

   Our objective is to enhance our position as a worldwide developer,
manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas delivery systems, components and
consumables used by semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers to
precisely measure, deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and
chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. In doing so, we assist our
customers in achieving improved returns on invested capital. Our strategy to
achieve this objective includes the following key elements:

  .  extend technology in high-growth markets;

  .  provide comprehensive and flexible product offerings;

  .  optimize global presence;

  .  continue to develop strategic relationships;

  .  maintain a diversified revenue stream;

  .  pursue strategic acquisitions; and

  .  leverage core technologies in related markets.

Our History

   Mykrolis Corporation is a Delaware corporation organized on October 16, 2000
under the name Millipore MicroElectronics, Inc. in connection with the proposed
spin-off by Millipore Corporation of its microelectronics business unit. On
March 27, 2001, we changed our name to Mykrolis Corporation. On March 31, 2001,
Millipore effected the separation of our business from Millipore's business and
is currently in the process of recording the transfer of assets in a number of
foreign jurisdictions. In the early 1980's, Millipore internally developed
products with applications in semiconductor manufacturing, which became the
Millipore microelectronics business unit. Subsequently, through internal
development and acquisitions, Millipore expanded that business unit into the
business that now makes up Mykrolis Corporation. Our principal executive
offices are located at One Patriots Park, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730, and our
telephone number is (877) 695-7654. We maintain a website on the Internet at
www.mykrolis.com. Information contained in our website is not incorporated by
reference into this prospectus, and you should not consider that information as
part of this prospectus.

Our Relationship With Millipore

   We are currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millipore. After the
completion of this offering, Millipore will own approximately 82.3% of the
outstanding shares of our common stock, or approximately 80.1% if the
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares.
Millipore currently plans to complete its divestiture of Mykrolis approximately
six months following this offering by distributing all of the shares of
Mykrolis common stock owned by Millipore to the holders of Millipore's common
stock. However, Millipore is not obligated to complete the distribution, and
the distribution may not occur by the anticipated time or at all.

   Millipore will, in its sole discretion but subject to the underwriter lock-
up agreement, determine the timing, structure and terms of its distribution of
our common stock. Millipore's distribution will also be subject to Millipore's
obtaining amendments to the covenants contained in its debt agreements.
Millipore has received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service that the distribution of the shares of our common stock to Millipore
stockholders will be tax-free to those stockholders and that our separation
from Millipore qualifies as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

   We have entered into agreements with Millipore related to the separation of
our business operations from Millipore. These agreements provide for, among
other things:

  .  the transfer from Millipore to us of assets, and the assumption by us of
     liabilities, relating to our business;

  .  the allocation of intellectual property between Millipore and us; and

  .  various interim and ongoing relationships between Millipore and us.

   The agreements regarding the separation of our business operations from
Millipore are described more fully in the sections entitled "Our Separation
from Millipore" and "Arrangements Between Mykrolis and Millipore" included
elsewhere in this prospectus. The terms of those agreements, which were
negotiated in the context of a parent-subsidiary relationship, may be more or
less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third
parties. See "Risk Factors--Risks Related to our Separation from Millipore."
The assets and liabilities that were transferred to us are described more fully
in our combined financial statements and notes to those statements that are
also included elsewhere in this prospectus.

Recent Developments

   On July 20, 2001, Millipore Corporation announced its unaudited consolidated
results of operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2001, including the net
sales and loss for the three months ended June 30, 2001 attributable to us. In
that announcement, Millipore reflected its microelectronics business as a
discontinued operation. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial

                             Summary Financial Data

   The following table sets forth summary historical financial information
derived from our audited combined statements of operations for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000, our unaudited combined balance sheet at March
31, 2001 and our unaudited combined statements of operations for the years
ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 and for the three months ended March 31, 2000
and 2001. The summary historical financial information includes allocations of
Millipore corporate expenses related to our business, including centralized
research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits, officers'
salaries, real estate, insurance, information technology services,
distribution, treasury and other Millipore corporate and infrastructure costs.
These expense allocations have been determined on a basis that Millipore and we
consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided
or the benefit received by us. The pro forma earnings per share and share
information is based on historical information and gives effect to the number
of shares required to be issued, at an estimated offering price of $16.00 per
share, in order to obtain the amount of net proceeds required to repay amounts
owed to Millipore under the separation agreements. You should read our
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and our combined financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this prospectus for a further explanation of the financial data
summarized here.

                                  RISK FACTORS

   You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an
investment decision. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these
risks could have a material and negative effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could
decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your
investment.

   This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are usually accompanied by
words such as "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" or similar
expressions. Our actual results may differ materially from the results
discussed in the forward-looking statements because of factors such as those
discussed below.

                  Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry

Our business depends substantially on semiconductor industry capital spending,
which is characterized by periodic fluctuations that may cause a reduction in
demand for our products.

   Our business depends substantially upon the capital expenditures of
semiconductor device manufacturers, which in turn depend upon the demand for
semiconductors and other products utilizing semiconductors. We estimate that
approximately 90% of our sales during 1999 and 2000 were to semiconductor
capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device manufacturers, and we
expect that sales to such customers will continue to account for a substantial
majority of our sales. Reductions in demand for the products manufactured by
semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers and semiconductor device
manufacturers will restrict our ability to grow our business and cause our
sales and profitability to decline. Historically, the semiconductor market has
been highly cyclical and has experienced periods of overcapacity, resulting in
significantly reduced demand for capital equipment used to make semiconductors.
For example, the semiconductor industry is currently experiencing a significant
decline, which is causing a number of our customers to reduce their orders. The
recent downturn has had an adverse effect on our recent operating results. Our
net sales for the first quarter of 2001 were $83.0 million, representing a
$17.0 million, or 17.0%, decline from our net sales in the fourth quarter of
2000. In addition, our 2001 second quarter net sales were $56.4 million,
representing a $26.6 million, or 32%, decline from our net sales in the first
quarter of 2001. Our 2001 first quarter and second quarter financial
information also reflects a negative currency effect on both sales and
profitability due to the declining value of the Japanese yen and the Euro
versus the US dollar. We also experienced downturns in 1996 and 1998. During
the 1998 downturn, our annual net sales declined approximately $82.9 million,
or 31% from the prior year. There is typically a three to six month lag between
a change in capital expenditures within the semiconductor industry and the
related impact on the demand for our products. If the current downturn
continues for any significant period of time, it will inhibit our growth and
cause our sales and profitability to decline significantly.

The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are
difficult to predict. As a result, our inability to meet demand in response to
these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our market share.

   Our ability to increase sales of our products, particularly our capital
equipment products, depends in part upon our ability to ramp up the use of our
manufacturing capacity for such products in a timely manner and to mobilize our
supply chain. In order to meet the demands of our customers, we may be required
to ramp up our manufacturing capacity in as little as a few months. If we are
unable to expand our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or to manage such
expansion effectively, our customers could seek such products from other
suppliers, and our market share could be reduced. Because demand shifts in the
semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to foresee, we may not be able
to increase capacity quickly enough to respond to such an increase in demand.

                                       10
<PAGE>

Our annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations as a
result of rapid demand shifts and our insignificant level of backlog and if we
fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share
price may decrease significantly.

   Our sales and operating results can vary significantly from quarter to
quarter and year to year. Because our expense levels are relatively fixed in
the short-term, an unanticipated decline in revenue in a particular quarter
could disproportionately affect our net income in that quarter. In addition, we
make a substantial portion of our shipments shortly after we receive the order,
and therefore we operate with an insignificant level of backlog. As a
consequence of the just-in-time nature of shipments and the low level of
backlog, our results of operations may decline quickly and significantly in
response to changes in order patterns or rapid decreases in demand for our
products. We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in
the future. Such fluctuations in our results could cause us to fail to meet the
expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our share
price to decline substantially. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of
our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon
them as indicators of our future performance.

Because we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties and many of our
costs are fixed, any significant changes, cancellations or deferrals could
cause our revenue and profitability to decline or fluctuate.

   As is typical in the microelectronics industry, we do not usually obtain
long-term purchase orders or commitments from our customers. Instead, we work
closely with our customers to develop non-binding forecasts of the future
volume of orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production
quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for reasons beyond our
control. Order cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold inventory for
longer than anticipated, which could reduce our profitability, restrict our
ability to fund our operations and cause us to incur unanticipated reductions
or delays in our revenue. Please see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Recent Developments" for a
discussion of recent cancellations and rescheduling of orders. Our customers
often change their orders multiple times between initial order and delivery.
Such changes usually relate to quantities or delivery dates, but sometimes
relate to the specifications of the products we are supplying. If a customer
does not timely pay for these products, we could incur significant charges
against our income. In addition, our profitability may be affected by the
generally fixed nature of our costs. Because a substantial portion of our costs
are fixed, we may experience and currently are experiencing deterioration in
gross margins when volumes decline. From time to time, we make capital
investments in anticipation of future business opportunities. We cannot assure
you that we will receive the anticipated business. If we are unable to obtain
the anticipated business, our revenue and profitability may decline.

If we are unable to maintain our technological expertise in design and
manufacturing processes, we will not be able to successfully compete.

   We believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to develop
and provide products that meet the changing needs of our customers, including
the transition from the use of 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers,
the shrinking of integrated circuit line-widths and the use of new classes of
materials, such as copper, titanium nitride and organic and inorganic
dielectric materials, which are materials that have either a low or high
resistance to the flow of electricity. This requires that we successfully
anticipate and respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes in a
cost-effective and timely manner. Our inability to develop the technical
specifications for any of our new products or enhancements to our existing
products or to manufacture and ship these products or enhancements in volume in
a timely manner could harm our business prospects and significantly reduce our
sales. In addition, if new products have reliability or quality problems, we
may experience reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance
and payment, additional service and warranty expense and damage to our
reputation.

Our competitive position will be weakened if semiconductor device manufacturers
do not require semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to design our
products into new generations of their equipment.

   New products designed by semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers
typically have a lifespan of five to ten years. Our competitive success depends
on our products being designed into new generations of

                                       11
<PAGE>

equipment for the semiconductor industry. In some cases, semiconductor device
manufacturers may direct semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a
specified supplier's product in their equipment. Accordingly, our success will
depend in part on our ability to have semiconductor device manufacturers
specify that our products be used at their semiconductor fabrication
facilities. If our products are not specified by our customers, our net sales
may be reduced during the lifespan of our customers' products.

Because our sales are concentrated on a small number of key customers, our
revenue and profitability may materially decline if one or more of our key
customers do not continue to purchase our existing and new products in
significant quantities.

   We depend and expect to continue to depend on a small number of customers
for a large portion of our business, and changes in our customers' orders have
had a significant impact on our operating results. In 1998, 1999, 2000 and the
three months ended March 31, 2001, our top customer accounted for approximately
11%, 13%, 18% and 17%, respectively, of our net sales. In those same periods,
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 29%, 31%, 39%
and 38%, respectively, of our net sales. In addition, we sell products to
systems integrators who then sell components, which include our products, to
some of our major customers. If any one of our key customers decides to
purchase significantly less from us or to terminate its relationship with us,
our revenue and profitability may decline significantly. We could lose our key
customers or significant sales to our key customers because of factors beyond
our control, such as a significant disruption in our customers' businesses
generally or in a specific product line. For example, we are currently
experiencing softening demand for our products as a result of the downturn in
the semiconductor industry. These customers may stop incorporating our products
into their products with limited notice to us and suffer little or no penalty
for doing so. In addition, if any of our customers merge, we may experience
lower overall sales from the merged companies. Because one of our strategies
has been to develop long-term relationships with a few key customers in the
product areas in which we focus and because we have a long product design and
development cycle for most of our products and prospective customers typically
require lengthy product qualification periods prior to placing volume orders,
we may be unable to replace these customers quickly or at all.

Competition from existing or new companies in the microelectronics industry
could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer
orders, reduced margins, the inability to take advantage of new business
opportunities and the loss of market share.

   We operate in a highly competitive industry. We compete against many
domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater manufacturing,
financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. In
addition, some of our competitors may have more developed relationships with
our existing customers than we do, which may enable them to have their products
specified for use more frequently by these customers. We also face competition
from the manufacturing operations of our current and potential customers, who
continually evaluate the benefits of internal manufacturing versus outsourcing.
As more original equipment manufacturers dispose of their manufacturing
operations and increase the outsourcing of their products to liquid and gas
delivery system and other component companies, we may face increasing
competitive pressures to grow our business in order to maintain our market
share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could
experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins,
the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and a loss of
market share.

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity and manufacturing efforts
outside the United States, which subjects us to additional business risks and
may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.

   Sales by our international subsidiaries to customers outside the United
States accounted for approximately 64% of our net sales in the three months
ended March 31, 2001, 61% of our net sales in 2000, 61% of our net sales in
1999 and 57% of our net sales in 1998. We anticipate that international sales
will continue to account for a majority of our net sales. In addition, a number
of our key domestic customers derive a significant portion of their revenues
from sales in international markets. We also manufacture a significant portion
of our products outside the United States and are dependent on international
suppliers for many of our parts. We intend to

                                       12
<PAGE>

continue to pursue opportunities in both sales and manufacturing
internationally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks
and potential costs that could adversely affect our revenue and profitability,
including:

  .  the transition of between 10% and 20% of our manufacturing operations to
     our new facility to be opened outside the United States in late 2001 or
     early 2002;

  .  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements that could impose
     additional costs on our operations or limit our ability to operate our
     business;

  .  greater difficulty in collecting our accounts receivable and longer
     payment cycles than is typical in domestic operations;

  .  changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing
     foreign operations; and

  .  political and economic instability.

   In the past, we have incurred costs or experienced disruptions due to the
factors described above and expect to do so in the future. For example, our
operations in Asia, and particularly Korea, Taiwan and Japan, have been
negatively impacted in the past as a result of regional economic instability,
most recently in 1998. In addition, Taiwan accounts for a growing portion of
the world's semiconductor manufacturing. There are currently strained relations
between China and Taiwan. Any adverse developments in those relations could
significantly disrupt the worldwide production of semiconductors, which would
lead to reduced sales of our products.

Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar in relation to other currencies may
lead to lower gross margins or may cause us to raise prices, which could result
in reduced sales.

   Exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our net sales and
results of operations. Approximately 61% of our net sales in 2000 and 64% of
our net sales in the first quarter of 2001 were denominated in foreign
currencies. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase
prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to
such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products
in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our profitability could
decline. In addition, sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in
the currency of the country in which these products are sold, and the currency
we receive in payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of
receipt versus the time of sale as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.

If we need to shift the production of any of our products to a different
manufacturing facility, we could face additional costs and delays that could
prevent us from meeting our customers' demands.

   While we have the capability to manufacture our products in multiple
facilities, the transfer of production from one facility to another is costly
and presents the possibility of additional disruptions and delays during the
transition period. We anticipate opening a new manufacturing facility outside
the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and moving between 10% and 20% of
our overall manufacturing operations from our existing domestic and foreign
manufacturing facilities to this new facility over the next two to three years.
The manufacture of our products is highly complex and requires sophisticated
and costly equipment, and we might not be able to successfully transition the
production to a different facility. As a result, any prolonged disruption in
the operations of any of our manufacturing facilities or any unforseen delays
in shifting manufacturing operations to our new facility to be opened outside
the United States, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction
or damage to the facility or other reasons, could result in increased costs and
reduced revenues and profitability and could harm our prospects.

                                       13
<PAGE>

We incur significant cash outlays over lengthy time periods in order to
research, develop, manufacture and market new products, which may never reach
market or may have limited market acceptance.

   We make significant cash expenditures to research, develop and market new
products. For example, we incurred $23.2 million of research and development
expense in 2000. The development period for a product can be as long as three
years. Following development, it may take an additional two to three years for
the market size of that product to reach a substantial level. We cannot be
certain of the success of a new product. A product concept may never progress
beyond the development stage or may only achieve limited acceptance in the
marketplace. Under such circumstances, we do not receive a direct return on our
expenditures and may not even realize any indirect benefits. Additionally,
capacity expansion may be necessary in order to manufacture a new product. If
sales levels do not increase to offset the additional fixed operating expenses
associated with any such expansion, our revenue and profitability could decline
and our prospects could be harmed.

We depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole source for our raw
materials and components, and our production would be substantially curtailed
if these suppliers are not able to meet our demands and alternative sources are
not available.

   We purchase raw materials and components from third parties to complete our
customers' orders, and some of these raw materials and components are ordered
from sole-source suppliers. Although we work with our customers and suppliers
to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components, we
sometimes experience short-term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and
delayed shipments. In the past, there have been industry-wide shortages of
electronic components, particularly memory and logic devices. If a significant
shortage of raw materials or components were to occur, we may have to delay
shipment. Supply shortages of particular components will likely substantially
curtail production of products using these components. In addition, while most
of our significant customer contracts permit periodic reviews of pricing based
on decreases and increases in the prices of raw materials and components, we
are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers and significant
price increases from our suppliers could cause our profitability to decline.
The loss of any of these or other significant suppliers, delays in shipments,
the inability of a supplier to meet performance and quality specifications or
delivery schedules or our inability to pass along price increases could cause
our revenue and profitability to decline significantly.

We may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures that could negatively
affect our profitability, increase our debt and dilute your ownership of our
company.

   As part of our business strategy, we expect to address gaps in our product
offerings, diversify into complementary product markets or pursue additional
technology and customers through acquisitions or joint ventures. As a result,
we may enter markets in which we have no or limited prior experience.
Competition for acquiring attractive businesses in our industry is substantial.
In executing this part of our business strategy, we may experience difficulty
in identifying suitable acquisition candidates or in completing selected
transactions at appropriate valuations. If we were to make any acquisitions, we
may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing
business and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or experience
negative effects on our reported results of operations from acquisition-related
charges and amortization of acquired technology, goodwill and other
intangibles. We may experience difficulties in operating in foreign countries
or over significant geographical distances and in retaining key employees or
customers of an acquired business, and our management's attention could be
diverted from other business issues. We may not identify or complete these
transactions in a timely manner, on a cost effective basis or at all, and we
may not realize the benefits of any acquisition or joint venture.

We may not have financing for future strategic acquisitions and we may be
limited in the amount of equity we can issue in acquisitions, which may prevent
us from addressing gaps in our product offerings, improving our technology or
increasing our manufacturing capacity.

   If we are able to identify acquisition candidates, we may finance such
acquisitions with substantial debt or with potentially dilutive issuances of
equity securities. Our ability to successfully complete acquisitions in the

                                       14
<PAGE>

future will depend upon the availability of financing and the market value of
our stock. In particular, we expect to fund future acquisitions in whole or in
part by issuing additional equity. If the price of our equity is low or
volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies. Further, any equity
issued would dilute your ownership of us. Also, under applicable tax rules
related to tax-free spinoff transactions, we will be significantly limited for
at least two years in our ability to issue shares of our common stock for
acquisitions.

   Our acquisition strategy could require us to incur substantial amounts of
indebtedness. As of June 30, 2001, we had no debt outstanding other than
amounts outstanding under the separation revolving credit agreement, which will
be repaid with the proceeds of this offering. Our future level of indebtedness
could have consequences for our business, including:

  .  greater vulnerability to the cyclical nature of our industry and the
     effects of rapid demand shifts affecting our business;

  .  dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
     repayment of debt, limiting the availability of cash for working
     capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions which may be attractive to
     us; and

  .  reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our
     business and industry.

   Furthermore, if we raise funds through the issuance of debt, the debt
securities issued will likely have rights, preferences and privileges senior to
those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation or
otherwise, and the terms of the debt securities may impose restrictions on our
operations. We cannot assure you that financing for acquisitions will be
available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and if we need to incur debt
for acquisitions or any other purpose prior to the distribution, we will be
restricted by the terms of Millipore's existing indebtedness.

Loss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their
experience in the microelectronics industry and their technological expertise.
Similarly, our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could
inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.

   We depend on the services of our key senior executives and other
technological experts because of their experience in the microelectronics
industry and their technical expertise. The loss of the services of one or
several of our key employees or an inability to attract, train and retain
qualified and skilled employees, specifically engineering and sales personnel,
could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to
operate and grow our business successfully. In particular, after our separation
from Millipore, we will have to develop and implement a new administrative and
managerial infrastructure. Our future success depends on the successful
development and implementation of this infrastructure and our ability to
expand, integrate and retain our management team. In addition, our ability to
successfully integrate acquired facilities or businesses depends, in part, on
our ability to retain and motivate key management and employees hired by us in
connection with the acquisition.

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and
prospects could be harmed.

   Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability
to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in our principal product
families. We rely, in part, on patent, trade secret and trademark law to
protect that technology. We routinely enter into confidentiality agreements
with our employees. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements
will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or
that our confidential and proprietary information and technology will not be
independently developed by or become otherwise known to third parties. We have
obtained a number of patents relating to our products and have filed
applications for additional patents. We cannot assure you that any of our
pending patent applications will be approved, that we will develop additional
proprietary technology that is patentable, that any patents owned by or issued
to us will provide us with competitive advantages or that these patents will
not be challenged by any third parties. Patent filings by third parties,
whether made before or after the date of our filings, could render our
intellectual property less valuable. Competitors may misappropriate our
intellectual property, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property
may arise. In addition, if we do not

                                       15
<PAGE>

obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property, our
competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired, which
would limit our growth and future revenue. Furthermore, there can be no
assurance that third parties will not design around our patents.

Protection of our intellectual property rights may result in costly litigation.

   We may from time to time be required to institute litigation in order to
enforce our patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to
protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the
proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such
litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
could negatively affect our sales, profitability and prospects regardless of
whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights. For example, in 1998,
we settled a patent lawsuit in which each party claimed infringement of a
patent by the other. In connection with the settlement, we incurred a charge of
approximately $3.7 million and agreed to a cross-license of the two patents at
issue. In connection with future intellectual property infringement claims, we
will not have the benefit of asserting counterclaims based on Millipore's
intellectual property portfolio, and we will not be able to offer licenses to
Millipore's intellectual property in order to resolve claims.

Our ability to manufacture and sell our products and develop new products in
response to competitive pressures could be restricted or delayed, and we could
incur significant expenses, if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses to
the proprietary technology of others.

   We license and will continue to license technology used in the manufacture
and distribution of our products from third parties. Our inability to acquire
any third-party licenses, or integrate the related third-party technologies
into our products, could result in delays in our product developments and
enhancements until equivalent technologies can be identified, licensed or
integrated. We may also require new licenses in the future as our business
grows and technology evolves. We cannot assure you that these licenses will be
available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

If we infringe on the proprietary technology of others, our business and
prospects could be harmed.

   Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to avoid
infringing or misappropriating any patents or other proprietary rights owned by
third parties. If we are found to infringe or misappropriate a third party's
patent or other proprietary rights, we could be required to pay damages to such
third party, alter our products or processes, obtain a license from the third
party or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights, including making
or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. If we are required to
obtain a license from a third party, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to do so on commercially favorable terms, if at all. We are currently a
defendant in a lawsuit in Japan instituted by Kurabo Industries Ltd. regarding
the alleged infringement of one of its Japanese patents. Kurabo Industries Ltd.
has alleged $11 million in damages and is seeking an injunction against our
future use of the technology at issue. There can be no assurances that we will
prevail in this litigation. If we do not prevail in this litigation, products
representing up to 4% of our sales in 2000 could be affected by an injunction.
The patent at issue expires in 2003.

We are subject to a variety of environmental laws which could cause us to incur
significant expenses.

   In addition to other regulatory requirements affecting our business, we are
subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign regulatory
requirements relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of, and human exposure to,
hazardous chemicals. We generate and handle materials that are considered
hazardous waste under applicable law. If we fail to comply with any present or
future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension
of production. In addition, compliance with these or future laws could restrict
our ability to expand our facilities or build new facilities or require us to
acquire costly equipment, incur other significant expenses or modify our
manufacturing processes.

                 Risks Related to our Separation from Millipore

Our historical financial information may not be representative of our results
as a stand-alone company and, therefore, may not be reliable as an indicator of
our historical or future results.

   We do not have an operating history as an independent company. Millipore did
not account for us, and we were not operated, as a stand-alone entity for the
periods presented. The historical combined financial information we have
included in this prospectus has been derived from Millipore's consolidated
financial statements and may not be indicative of our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows in the future nor is it necessarily
indicative of what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows
would have been had we been a stand-alone entity for the periods presented.
This is primarily a result of the following factors:

  . our historical combined financial statements reflect allocations,
    primarily with respect to general corporate and research expenses. These
    allocations may be less than the general corporate and research expenses
    we will incur in the future as a stand-alone company; and

  . our historical combined financial statements do not reflect the
    significant changes that we expect to occur in the future as a result of
    our separation from Millipore, this offering and the distribution,
    including changes in how we fund our operations, conduct research and tax
    planning and manage employee matters. Following our separation from
    Millipore, we expect to incur incremental non-recurring operating costs
    and expenses associated with increased marketing expenses related to
    establishing a new brand identity, legal fees, retention bonuses,
    increased depreciation due to decreases in the estimated useful lives of
    fixed assets and leasehold improvements and other separation related
    costs. In 2001 and 2002, we expect to incur approximately $10.5 million
    of such expenses associated with our separation from Millipore.

We have no history operating as a stand-alone company, and we may be unable to
make the changes necessary to operate as a stand-alone company, or we may incur
greater costs as a stand-alone company that may cause our profitability to
decline.

   Prior to our separation, Millipore conducted our business as a division
through various subsidiaries rather than as a stand-alone company. In addition,
Millipore performed various corporate functions for us, including the
following:
  . information technology;
  . finance and accounting;
  . public relations;
  . employee relations;
  . investor relations; and
  . legal and tax functions.

   Until the distribution, and in some cases even after the distribution, we
will rely on Millipore for various transitional services, as described under
"Arrangements Between Mykrolis and Millipore--Master Transitional Services
Agreement." We currently use Millipore's systems to support our operations,
including systems for managing inventory, order processing, human resources,
shipping, accounting, payroll and internal computing operations. Many of these
systems are proprietary to Millipore and are very complex. These systems have
been modified, and are in the process of being further modified, to enable us
to separately track items related to our business. These modifications,
however, may result in unexpected system failures or the loss or corruption of
data. We are in the process of creating our own systems and business functions
to replace many of the systems and business functions that Millipore provides
us. We may not be successful in implementing these systems or transitioning
data from Millipore's systems to ours in a timely manner. If we do not have in
place our own systems and business functions or if we do not have agreements
with other providers of these services once our transitional services agreement
with Millipore expires, we may not be able to effectively operate our business,
and our profitability may decline.

                                       17
<PAGE>

   Any failure or significant downtime in Millipore's or our own information
systems could prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products or
billing customers and could cause delays in production and delivery of our
products and could harm our business and prospects. In addition, Millipore's
and our information systems require the services of employees with extensive
knowledge of these information systems and the business environment in which we
operate.

We currently use Millipore's operational and administrative infrastructure, and
our ability to satisfy our customers and operate our business will suffer if we
do not develop our own infrastructure quickly and cost effectively.

   We have identified facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts for operational and
administrative use following the separation, and we currently have office space
in Millipore's Bedford, Massachusetts campus. We have entered into arrangements
with Millipore under the master transitional services agreement to continue to
use its facilities until we can transition all of our personnel and equipment
to our new facilities. This transition is expected to be completed on or after
the distribution date. We are building an independent business infrastructure
following our separation from Millipore, and we expect to make capital
expenditures of approximately $8 million for renovations to laboratory and
office space at our headquarters facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, and
approximately $14 million in connection with the opening of a new manufacturing
facility outside the United States. If we are unable to successfully transition
our operations to these new facilities and build our independent business
infrastructure in a timely fashion, we may incur significant additional costs
and our business and prospects will be harmed.

We currently use Millipore's manufacturing infrastructure, and our ability to
meet our customer's demands will suffer if we do not successfully transition
our manufacturing requirements to our own facilities.

   We are in the process of transitioning our manufacturing capabilities from
Millipore facilities to our own facilities and have entered into transition
agreements with Millipore relating to the manufacture and distribution of
specified products for limited periods of time. Pursuant to our worldwide
manufacturing rationalization plan, we are in the process of consolidating a
number of our existing manufacturing facilities. We anticipate opening a new
manufacturing facility outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and
anticipate moving between 10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations
from our existing domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new
facility over the next two to three years. The new facility is expected to
replace manufacturing capacity that we will lose as a result of our exit from
the Jaffrey, New Hampshire facility as part of the separation. With respect to
our new manufacturing facility outside the United States, there can be no
assurance that we will be able to identify an acceptable location or enter into
an agreement for such facility on favorable terms or at all. In addition, even
if we obtain an acceptable facility, we may face unforeseen delays or costs in
transitioning our manufacturing activities to this facility. As a result of the
disruption to our manufacturing process we may face unforeseen production
delays. Any disruption to our production capacity could prevent us from meeting
our customers' delivery requirements and could harm our business.

Following our separation from Millipore, we will not have access to the
research and development resources that were previously available to us, which
could limit our research and development activities, thereby inhibiting our
ability to develop new products in response to competitive pressures and
harming our business and prospects.

   Prior to our separation from Millipore, many research and development
projects were conducted through the centralized Millipore research group.
Following our separation from Millipore, while our research and development
personnel have been transferred to us in accordance with the terms of the
separation agreements, we do not have access to any other resources or
personnel in Millipore's research group other than in specific limited
circumstances outlined in our research agreement with Millipore. This agreement
is described in greater detail under the caption "Arrangements between Mykrolis
and Millipore--Research Agreement." As a result,

                                       18
<PAGE>

we will not have access to all of the research and development facilities and
resources that were previously available to us, and we may not be able to
manage projects as successfully as we have in the past. If we are unable to
continue to successfully develop new products and technology through internal
research and development activities, we may not be able to maintain our market
position or successfully grow our business and our business and prospects may
be harmed.

Our agreements with Millipore limit our ability to use Millipore's technology
to fields of use in the microelectronics industry and may prevent us from
expanding our business beyond the microelectronics industry.

   Our use of Millipore's technology is governed by the separation agreements,
such as the master patent license agreement and the master trade secret and
know-how agreement. The licenses granted by these agreements prohibit our use
of Millipore's technology in fields of use outside of the microelectronics
industry. In general, where technology is used both by Millipore in the
manufacture of its products and by us in the manufacture of our products,
Millipore retained ownership of the technology and granted to us a license to
use the technology limited to fields of use in the microelectronics industry.
In some cases, Millipore transferred ownership of the technology to us and
retained an exclusive license to the technology in its fields of use in the
biopharmaceutical and related industries. Under the master patent license
agreement and the master trade secret and know-how agreement, we may sell
products using Millipore's technology only to customers in the microelectronics
industry, as defined in the agreements, and we may not transfer the technology
except in limited circumstances. These restrictions could limit our ability to
expand our business into markets outside the microelectronics industry, which
could limit our growth.

Prior to the anticipated distribution, Millipore will have substantial control
over our business operations.

   Prior to this offering, Millipore held all of our outstanding common stock,
and after the offering, Millipore will beneficially own approximately 82.3% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock and 80.1% if the underwriters fully
exercise their over-allotment option. As a result, Millipore has significant
control over our business, policies and affairs. For example, Millipore has the
power to appoint new management, prevent or cause a change of control, alter
the terms of our separation agreements with Millipore, allocate business
opportunities that may be suitable for us and approve any action requiring the
approval of the holders of our common stock, including adopting amendments to
our certificate of incorporation and approving mergers or sales of all or
substantially all of our assets. The interests of Millipore may differ from
your interests or the interests of other stockholders. Investors in this
offering will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote prior
to the distribution of our stock to the Millipore stockholders, and Millipore
may not complete the distribution of our stock to Millipore's stockholders.
Millipore is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a
third party.

Because the distribution is subject to conditions, the distribution may not
occur and we may not achieve many of the expected benefits of our separation,
we may lose many of our employees and our business and stock price may suffer.

   Millipore currently intends that, subject to obtaining approval by the
Millipore board of directors, it will distribute to its stockholders all of our
common stock that it owns approximately six months after this offering.
However, Millipore is not obligated to make such a distribution, and the
distribution may not occur by that time or at all. Millipore has advised us
that it would not complete the distribution if its board of directors
determines that the distribution is no longer in the best interest of Millipore
and its stockholders. Millipore's distribution will also be contingent upon
Millipore's obtaining amendments to the covenants contained in its debt
agreements. Millipore has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service
that the distribution will be tax-free to Millipore stockholders and that our
separation from Millipore qualifies as a reorganization. Until this
distribution occurs, the risks relating to Millipore's control of us will
continue to be relevant to our stockholders. If the distribution is delayed or
not completed at all, the liquidity of our shares will be severely constrained
unless and until Millipore elects to sell some of its significant ownership.
Other than the underwriter lock-up agreement, there are no limits on these
sales and the sale or potential sale by Millipore

                                       19
<PAGE>

could adversely affect the market price of our stock. In addition, because of
the limited number of publicly-traded shares of our common stock until the
distribution occurs, relatively small trades of our stock will have a
disproportionate effect on our stock price. Also, if Millipore does not
distribute its shares, we may face significant difficulty hiring and retaining
key personnel, many of whom may be attracted by the potential of operating our
business as a fully independent entity.

We will not be able to rely on Millipore to fund our future capital
requirements, and financing from other sources may not be available on
favorable terms or at all.

   In the past, our capital needs have been satisfied by Millipore. However,
following the consummation of this offering, Millipore will no longer provide
funds to finance our working capital or other cash requirements. We cannot
assure you that financing from other sources, if needed, will be available on
favorable terms or at all. We will likely not be able to obtain financing with
interest rates as favorable as those that Millipore could obtain. In addition,
following our separation from Millipore but prior to the distribution by
Millipore of our capital stock owned by them, we will be subject to the
restrictive covenants contained in Millipore's existing debt agreements, which
will restrict our ability to incur debt. With limited exceptions, the terms of
Millipore's debt agreements will prohibit us from creating or incurring any
lien on our properties or assets prior to the time that Millipore owns less
than 50% of our capital stock. Similarly, the indentures governing Millipore's
publicly-traded bonds prohibit us, until such time as Millipore owns less than
50% of our capital stock, from creating or incurring any lien on our properties
or assets unless Millipore's bonds are secured by an equal and ratable lien on
the same properties or assets. As described more fully under "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations--
Liquidity and Capital Resources," we anticipate obtaining a short-term line of
credit of up to $35 million following this offering. However, we may not be
able to obtain this line of credit on favorable terms or at all and these
covenants may limit or restrict our ability to obtain a short-term line of
credit prior to the distribution.

If the transitional services being provided to us by Millipore are not
sufficient to meet our needs, or if we are not able to replace these services
after our agreements with Millipore expire, we will be unable to manage
critical operational functions of our business.

   Millipore has agreed to provide transitional services to us, including
services related to:

  .  information technology support services;

  .  supply chain management;

  .  human resources administration;

  .  research and development;

  .  product order administration;

  .  customer support;

  .  manufacture of membranes;

  .  product distribution;

  .  buildings and facilities, including office and manufacturing space;

  .  treasury services; and

  .  legal, finance, tax and accounting services.

   Although Millipore is contractually obligated to provide us with these
services, these services may not be provided at the same level as when we were
part of Millipore, and we may not be able to obtain the same benefits. These
transitional service arrangements generally have a term of five years following
the separation in the case of manufacturing and research services and one year
following the separation in most other cases. After the expiration of these
various arrangements, we may not be able to replace the transitional services
or enter into appropriate leases or other agreements in a timely manner or on
terms and conditions, including cost, as favorable as those we will receive
from Millipore. In particular, the manufacture of membranes involves the use of
proprietary processes and equipment that belong to Millipore. As a result,
after the expiration of the membrane manufacture agreement, we must acquire or
design our own manufacturing equipment and develop our own processes to replace
these proprietary processes and equipment.

                                       20
<PAGE>

   These agreements were made in the context of a parent-subsidiary
relationship and were negotiated in the overall context of our separation from
Millipore. The prices charged to us under these agreements may be lower than
the prices that we may be required to pay third parties for similar services or
the costs of similar services if we undertake them ourselves and accordingly,
following the expiration of our agreements with Millipore, our costs to procure
these services may increase.

Our directors and executive officers may have conflicts of interest because of
their ownership of Millipore common stock and because one is also a director
and non-executive chairman of Millipore.

   Many of our directors and executive officers have a substantial amount of
their personal financial portfolios in Millipore common stock and options to
purchase Millipore common stock. In addition, their unvested options to
purchase Millipore common stock may not convert into options to purchase our
common stock if the distribution does not occur. Ownership of Millipore common
stock by our directors and officers after our separation from Millipore could
create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when directors and
officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for
Millipore and us. In addition, C. William Zadel, our Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer and one of our directors, is also the Chairman, Chief
Executive Officer and a director of Millipore. Upon consummation of this
offering, Mr. Zadel will resign as Chief Executive Officer of Millipore but
will continue to serve as non-executive chairman of Millipore. He will have
obligations to both companies and may have conflicts of interest with respect
to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as
acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for both
Millipore and us. Because our certificate of incorporation provides, in
accordance with Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, that
we have renounced any interest in future business opportunities that are
presented to Millipore, its subsidiaries other than us, or our officers or
directors who are also employees or directors of Millipore or its subsidiaries
other than us at the time the opportunity is presented, these conflicts may not
ultimately be resolved on favorable terms for us. In addition, because Section
122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law was only recently enacted,
there is no case law testing the statutory provision and little other guidance
interpreting it. As a result, the Delaware courts may interpret the statute in
the future in a manner not anticipated by Millipore or us or the statute may be
modified or amended in the future in a manner not anticipated by Millipore or
us.

We may have potential business conflicts of interest with Millipore with
respect to our past and ongoing relationships and, because of Millipore's
controlling ownership, we may not resolve these conflicts on the most favorable
terms to us.

   Conflicts of interest may arise between Millipore and us in a number of
areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:

  .  labor, tax, employee benefit, intellectual property, indemnification and
     other matters arising from our separation from Millipore;

  .  employee retention and recruiting;

  .  the sale or distribution by Millipore of all or any portion of its
     ownership interest in us;

  .  the nature, quality and pricing of transitional services Millipore has
     agreed to provide us;

  .  business opportunities that may be attractive to both Millipore and us;
     and

  .  the terms of the non-competition provisions contained in the separation
     agreements between Millipore and us, which govern Millipore's ability to
     compete with us.

   We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do,
the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an
unaffiliated party. The agreements we have entered into with Millipore may be
amended upon agreement between the parties. While we are controlled by
Millipore, Millipore may be able to require us to agree to amendments to these
agreements that may be less favorable to us than the current terms of the
agreements.

Our ability to engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions using
our stock is subject to limitations because of the federal income tax
requirements for a tax-free distribution.

   For the distribution of our stock by Millipore to qualify as tax-free to
Millipore and its stockholders, Millipore must own at least 80% of the voting
power of our voting stock at the time of the distribution. In order to satisfy
the requirements for a tax-free distribution, we may not issue additional stock
prior to the distribution if it would reduce Millipore's voting power below
this 80% threshold. If the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in
full, we will have issued stock representing approximately 19.9% of our voting
power in the offering. Thus, before the distribution, we may issue to persons
other than Millipore only a limited amount of our stock in acquisitions or
otherwise without affecting the tax-free status of the distribution.
In addition, for the distribution of our stock by Millipore to qualify as tax-
free to Millipore, there must not be a change in ownership of 50% or more in
either the voting power or value of either our stock or Millipore's stock that
is considered to be part of a plan or a series of related transactions related
to Millipore's intended distribution of our stock to its stockholders. For this
purpose, a change in ownership may include the issuance of our common stock or
Millipore's common stock in acquisitions and other similar strategic
transactions or for compensation of employees and others. If there is a direct
or indirect acquisition of our stock or Millipore's stock by one or more
persons during the four-year period beginning two years prior to and ending two
years after the distribution, it will be presumed to be part of a plan or a
series of related transactions related to Millipore's intended distribution of
our stock, and the distribution will be taxable to Millipore unless the
presumption is successfully rebutted. The direct or indirect acquisition of our
stock can include open market transactions. As a result, if within two years of
the distribution any person or group of persons acting pursuant to a
coordinated plan acquires 50% or more of our common stock, including through
open market transactions, that is part of a plan or series of related
transactions with the distribution by Millipore of our common stock, the
distribution will be taxable to Millipore. Pursuant to our tax sharing
agreement with Millipore, we may be responsible for the tax imposed on
Millipore if the distribution fails to qualify as tax-free. For the above
reasons, we are limited in our ability to use our stock for acquisitions and
other similar strategic transactions or for compensation of employees and
others. Many of our competitors have issued their stock to complete
acquisitions, to expand their product offerings and speed the development of
new technology, and to attract and retain employees and other key personnel.
Therefore, these competitors may have a significant competitive advantage over
us.

We may be responsible for income tax liabilities that relate to the proposed
distribution of shares of our common stock by Millipore.

   Millipore has received a tax ruling from the IRS to the effect that the
distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. The tax ruling is binding on the IRS, and can be relied upon by
Millipore provided that the factual representations and assumptions made in
Millipore's request are true. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances
that would cause such representations and assumptions to be untrue.

   Our tax sharing agreement with Millipore provides that we will be
responsible for certain taxes imposed on Millipore, us or our respective
subsidiaries if (i) we or one or more of our shareholders are responsible for
the distribution's failure to qualify for tax-free treatment, or (ii) the
distribution of our shares subsequently becomes taxable to Millipore as a
result of a change of ownership of 50% or more of the voting power or value of
our stock. The process for determining whether a change of ownership has
occurred under the tax rules is complex. If we do not carefully monitor our
compliance with these rules we might inadvertently cause or permit a change of
ownership to occur, triggering our obligation to indemnify Millipore pursuant
to the tax sharing agreement. In addition, our obligation to indemnify
Millipore in the event that a change of ownership causes the distribution not
to be tax-free could discourage or prevent a third party from making a proposal
to acquire our company. If the distribution by Millipore was determined to be
taxable, the U.S. federal income tax payable by Millipore as a result of the
distribution for which we have agreed to indemnify Millipore would be equal to
35% of the difference between the market value of the distributed stock on the
date of the distribution and the tax basis of

                                       22
<PAGE>

such stock. Assuming a market value of $16.00 per share for the distributed
stock, the U.S. federal income tax payable by Millipore would equal
approximately $128.3 million. If we were required to pay any of the taxes
described above, the payment would significantly harm our business, financial
position, results of operations and cash flow.

We have agreed to convert the unvested Millipore stock options held by our
directors, officers and employees as of the distribution date into options to
purchase shares of our common stock at a conversion rate based on the then
market prices of the shares and any significant increase in the price of
Millipore's common stock or decrease in our stock price prior to the
distribution date could result in additional dilution to stockholders
purchasing shares in this offering.

   Many of our directors, officers and employees have unvested options to
purchase Millipore common stock that will convert into options to purchase our
common stock at the time of the distribution. These options will be converted
using a formula that is based on the relative values of Millipore common stock
and our common stock at the time of the conversion, which we expect to be at
the time the distribution occurs. Because our conversion obligation depends on
the value of these stocks, the number of our shares to be issued cannot be
determined at this time. Our obligation could result in a significant number of
our shares being subject to substituted awards, depending on the values of
Millipore common stock and our common stock at the time of conversion. Please
see "Management--Treatment of Millipore Options" for more detailed information
about the number of these Millipore options held by our employees and about how
they will be converted into options based on our common stock.

   Risks Related to the Securities Markets and Ownership of Our Common Stock

Substantial sales of common stock, including sales by index funds, may occur in
connection with the distribution, which could cause our stock price to decline.

   If Millipore distributes all of the shares of our common stock that it owns
to Millipore stockholders after this offering, substantially all of these
shares will be eligible for immediate resale in the public market. We are
unable to predict whether significant amounts of common stock will be sold in
the open market in anticipation of, or following, this distribution, or by
Millipore if the distribution does not occur. We are also unable to predict
whether a sufficient number of buyers will be in the market at that time. A
portion of Millipore's common stock is held by index funds tied to the Standard
& Poor's 500 Index or other stock indices. If our stock is not included in
these indices at the time of Millipore's distribution of our common stock,
these index funds will be required to sell our stock that they receive in the
distribution. As of March 31, 2001, index funds held less than 5% of
Millipore's common stock. Some other institutional stockholders are not allowed
by their charters to hold stock of companies that do not pay dividends. Because
we currently do not intend to pay dividends, we expect that these stockholders
will sell the shares of our common stock distributed to them. As of March 31,
2001, approximately 85% of Millipore's common stock was held by institutional
investors, including index funds. Any sales of substantial amounts of our
common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might
occur, whether as a result of the distribution or otherwise, could cause the
market price of our common stock to decrease. Millipore has the sole
discretion, subject to the underwriter lock-up agreement, to determine the
timing, structure and terms of its distribution of our common stock, all of
which may also affect the level of market transactions in our common stock.

Our securities have no prior market, and we cannot assure you that our stock
price will not decline after the offering.

   Before this offering, there has not been a public market for our common
stock, and an active public market for our common stock may not develop or be
sustained after this offering. The market price of our common stock could be
subject to significant fluctuations after this offering. Among the factors that
could affect our stock price are:

  .  quarterly variations in our operating results;

  .  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research
     reports by analysts;

  .  speculation in the press or investment community;

                                       23
<PAGE>

  .  strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or
     restructurings;

  .  actions by institutional stockholders or by Millipore prior to its
     distribution of our stock;

  .  general market conditions; and

  .  domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our
     performance.

   The stock markets in general, and the markets for high technology stocks in
particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated
to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market
fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decrease. In
particular, we cannot assure you that you will be able to resell your shares at
or above the initial public offering price, which will be determined by
negotiations between the representatives of the underwriters and us.

Provisions in our charter documents, Delaware law, the Internal Revenue Code
relating to Millipore's distribution of our common stock and our shareholder
rights plan, when implemented, may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, which
could decrease the value of your shares.


   Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and, when
implemented, our shareholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it
harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of
directors, although these provisions have little significance while we are
controlled by Millipore. These provisions include a classified board of
directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent. In
addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without
stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a
potential hostile acquirer. Our shareholder rights plan, when implemented, will
permit our stockholders to purchase shares of our common stock at a 50%
discount upon the occurrence of specified events, including the acquisition by
anyone of 15% or more of our common stock, unless such event is approved by our
board of directors. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other
business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our
outstanding common stock. Although we believe these provisions provide for an
opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to
negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer
may be considered beneficial by stockholders. If a change of control or change
in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock
could suffer.

   In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our common stock could
trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code or
prevent Millipore from distributing "control" of us as defined in Section
368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. For a discussion of Section 355(e) and
Section 368(c), please see "Our Separation from Millipore--Tax Limitations on
Additional Issuances of Our Stock." Under the tax sharing agreement, we would
be required to indemnify Millipore for the resulting tax and this indemnity
obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that
stockholders may consider favorable.

Participants in our directed share program must hold their shares for a minimum
of 30 days following the date of this prospectus and accordingly will be
subject to market risks not imposed on other investors in the offering.

   At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the common stock
offered hereby for sale to our employees, families and friends of directors and
executive officers and other persons having business relationships with us. As
a condition to the purchase of reserved shares, the purchasers will be required
to agree that they may not, subject to exceptions, offer, sell, contract to
sell or otherwise dispose of or hedge any such shares for a period of 30 days
after the date of this prospectus. As a result of such restriction, such
purchasers may face risks not faced by other investors who have the right to
sell their shares at any time following the offering. These risks include the
market risk of holding our shares during the period that such restrictions are
in effect and limitations on such purchasers' ability to transfer the shares
for tax planning purposes or otherwise.

                                       24
<PAGE>

The initial public offering price is significantly higher than the book value
of our common stock, and you will experience immediate and substantial dilution
in the value of your investment.

   The initial public offering price per share significantly exceeds our net
tangible book value per share. Accordingly, investors purchasing shares in this
offering will suffer immediate and substantial dilution of $8.77 per share,
based on an estimated offering price of $16.00 per share after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses and after application of
the net proceeds as set forth under "Use of Proceeds", meaning that your share
of our net tangible book value immediately following this offering will be less
than the price that you paid for our common stock in this offering. As a
result, unless we are able to increase our net tangible book value per share
through income from operations or otherwise, upon a liquidation of Mykrolis at
net tangible book value, you would receive less than the price that you paid
for our common stock in this offering while Millipore would receive more than
its cost for its shares of Mykrolis. See "Dilution."

Your percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital
stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders
vote.

   Following the consummation of this offering, our board of directors has the
authority, without action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part
of our authorized but unissued shares. These issuances would dilute your
percentage ownership interest, which will have the effect of reducing your
influence over matters on which our stockholders vote. In addition, if the
issuances are made at prices that reflect a discount from the then current
trading price of our common stock, your interest in the book value of our
common stock might be diluted.

                         OUR SEPARATION FROM MILLIPORE

Overview

   On October 3, 2000, Millipore announced its plan to make its
microelectronics operating division, which was subsequently organized as
Mykrolis, an independent, publicly-traded company focused on the
microelectronics industry. Until the completion of this offering, we will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Millipore. The separation of our business from
Millipore, including the transfer of related assets, liabilities and
intellectual property rights, was effected as of March 31, 2001.

Benefits of the Separation Following the Distribution

   We believe that the benefits we will realize as a result of our separation
from Millipore include the following:

   More Capital Planning Flexibility. As a separate company, we will have
enhanced capital planning flexibility. We will be able to have direct access to
the capital markets to issue debt or equity securities and to use our own stock
to facilitate growth through acquisitions. Moreover, we will no longer have to
compete with other business units of Millipore for funding from Millipore.

   Greater Strategic Focus. In addition to the microelectronics business,
Millipore generates significant revenue from other lines of products, including
biopharmaceutical, life sciences, laboratory and food and beverage products.
Our focus will be on developing businesses and strategic opportunities for
microelectronics products. This effort will be supported by our board of
directors, management team and employees.

   Increased Speed and Responsiveness. As a company smaller than Millipore, we
will focus on one line of business. As a result, we expect to make decisions
more quickly, deploy resources more rapidly and efficiently and operate with
more agility than we could as a part of a larger organization. As a result, we
expect to be more responsive to customers and suppliers.

   Better Incentives for Employees and Greater Accountability. We expect that
the motivation of our employees and the focus of our management will be
strengthened by incentive compensation programs tied to the market performance
of our common stock. Our separation from Millipore will enable us to offer our
employees compensation directly linked to the performance of the
microelectronics business, which we expect to enhance our ability to attract
and retain qualified personnel.

Disadvantages of the Separation Following the Distribution

   Our separation from Millipore entails a number of significant disadvantages,
including the following:

   Reduced Diversification of Revenues. As a separate company focused on the
microelectronics industry, our revenues will be more closely tied to market
conditions in that industry and, during market downturns such as the one
currently affecting the microelectronics industry, our revenues and income will
likely be more negatively impacted than if we had a more diversified business.
As a result, during market downturns in the microelectronics industry, we will
not be able to rely on alternative revenue streams previously available to us
from Millipore to fund our cash needs.

   Reduced Economies of Scale. As a company smaller than Millipore, we will not
be able to realize the same economies of scale in purchasing raw materials,
manufacturing and distributing our products, maintaining our facilities and
providing sales and service support to our customers. In addition, we will no
longer be able to benefit from Millipore's market presence when negotiating
terms for our leases, supply agreements or other contracts and we may not be
able to achieve as favorable pricing terms as were available to us as part of
Millipore.

   Reduced Availability of Resources. As a separate company, we will not have
access to the breadth and depth of resources previously available to us as a
part of Millipore. For example, we will have fewer

                                       27
<PAGE>

employees and more limited research and development facilities and expertise.
In addition, while we will have more capital planning flexibility and direct
access to the capital markets, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms
as favorable as those that would have been available to us as part of
Millipore.

   The Need to Establish a New Brand Identity. As a newly organized company, we
will need to allocate resources to develop a new brand identity under the name
Mykrolis and will no longer be able to benefit from Millipore's international
presence and reputation.

Separation and Transitional Arrangements

   Millipore and we, and, in some cases, our respective subsidiaries, have
entered into agreements providing for the separation of our business from
Millipore, including a master separation and distribution agreement. These
agreements generally provide for, among other things:

  .  the transfer from Millipore to us of assets and the assumption by us of
     liabilities relating to our business;

  .  the allocation of intellectual property between Millipore and us; and

  .  various interim and ongoing relationships between Millipore and us.

Tax Limitations on Additional Issuances of Our Stock

   After the completion of this offering, we will be limited in the amount of
stock that we can issue because of potential adverse tax consequences.

   First, in order for the distribution to be tax-free to Millipore and its
stockholders, Millipore must distribute "control" of Mykrolis, as defined in
Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Section 368(c), "control"
means ownership of stock possessing at least 80% of the total combined voting
power of all classes of stock entitled to vote and at least 80% of the total
number of shares of each other class of nonvoting stock. Because we will have
only voting stock outstanding, Millipore must distribute stock representing at
least 80% of the combined voting power of our common stock to satisfy the
Section 368(c) "control" test. If the over-allotment option granted by us is
exercised in full, we will have issued or transferred stock representing
approximately 19.9% of our voting power in the offering. Thus, before the
distribution we may issue to persons other than Millipore only a limited amount
of our stock in acquisitions or otherwise without violating the Section 368(c)
"control" test.

   Second, under Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, Millipore will
recognize taxable gain on the distribution if there are one or more
acquisitions of our stock representing 50% or more of our stock, measured by
vote or value, and the stock acquisitions are part of a plan or series of
related transactions that includes the distribution. The shares issued in the
offering including any shares issued in the over-allotment option, to the
extent it is exercised, will be considered to be part of a plan that includes
the distribution. In addition, any other shares of our common stock acquired
within two years before or after the distribution are presumed to be part of
such a plan unless we can rebut that presumption. Under proposed Treasury
regulations, which may or may not be adopted in their current form, shares
issued in acquisitions that occur or are negotiated less than six months after
the distribution will generally be treated as part of the plan. Consequently,
to avoid causing the distribution to be taxable to Millipore under Section
355(e), we may be significantly limited in our ability to issue our shares in
acquisitions that are negotiated or closed within six months after the
distribution. We may continue to be subject to restrictions on the use of stock
for acquisitions after this six-month period. If an issuance of our stock
causes the distribution to be taxable to Millipore under Section 355(e), we
could be required to indemnify Millipore against that tax under the tax sharing
agreement.

The Distribution by Millipore of Our Common Stock

   After completion of this offering, Millipore will own approximately 82.3% of
the outstanding shares of our common stock, or approximately 80.1% if the
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase

                                       28
<PAGE>

additional shares. Millipore currently plans to complete its divestiture of
Mykrolis approximately six months after this offering by distributing all of
its shares of our common stock to the holders of Millipore's common stock.
However, Millipore is not obligated to complete the distribution, and we cannot
assure you as to whether or when it will occur.

   Millipore has received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the
distribution will be tax-free to Millipore stockholders and that the
transaction will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. Millipore has advised us that it would not complete the distribution
if its board of directors determines that the distribution is no longer in the
best interest of Millipore and its stockholders. Millipore has further advised
us that it currently expects that the principal factors it would consider in
determining whether and when to complete the distribution include:

  .  the relative market prices of our common stock and Millipore's common
     stock;

  .  the absence of any court orders or regulations prohibiting or
     restricting the completion of the distribution; and

  .  other conditions affecting our business or Millipore's business.

In addition, Millipore's distribution will be contingent upon Millipore's
obtaining amendments to the covenants contained in its debt agreements,
including with respect to permitted dividends and distributions.

                                       29
<PAGE>

                                USE OF PROCEEDS

   We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$101.0 million, based on the estimated initial public offering price of $16.00
per share and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for:

  .  repayment of an aggregate of $26.0 million, assuming an offering price
     of $16.00 per share, outstanding under our separation revolving credit
     agreement and our separation note with Millipore. Amounts outstanding
     under the separation revolving credit agreement must be repaid on or
     before the earlier of December 31, 2002 or fifteen days following the
     closing of this offering and bear no interest. Any amounts remaining
     outstanding thereafter are in default and bear interest at a rate of
     twelve-month LIBOR plus 1.5% per annum. As of June 30, 2001 we had
     approximately $13.8 million outstanding under the separation revolving
     credit agreement. Amounts borrowed under the separation revolving credit
     agreement were used to fund our working capital requirements between the
     date of our separation and this offering and to satisfy any amounts
     payable by us related to the retention by Millipore of specified
     Mykrolis assets and liabilities and the retention by us of specified
     Millipore assets and liabilities that could not be transferred at the
     separation due to restrictions imposed by foreign laws or because such
     transfer was not practical. The separation note is payable no later than
     the fifteenth day following this offering and any amounts repaid on or
     prior to such date will bear no interest. If we are in default on the
     payment of the separation note, interest will accrue at an interest rate
     equal to a base rate plus 1.5% per annum. At March 31, 2001, the
     interest rate would have been 9.5% per annum. Millipore contributed its
     microelectronics business to us in exchange for shares of our common
     stock plus the separation note. The amount of the separation note
     represents amounts payable to Millipore pursuant to the terms of our
     separation agreements and was determined by agreement between Millipore
     and us to ensure that all net proceeds of this offering in excess of
     $75.0 million would be payable to Millipore. The principal balance of
     the separation note is calculated by deducting from the net proceeds of
     this offering (i) the outstanding balance under the separation revolving
     credit agreement as described above, and (ii) the $75.0 million to be
     retained by us for general corporate purposes from the proceeds of this
     offering. As a result, the allocation of the $26.0 million between the
     separation revolving credit agreement and the separation note will not
     be determined until the time of the offering based upon the amounts
     borrowed under the separation revolving credit agreement; and

  .  $75.0 million for general corporate purposes, such as capital
     expenditures associated with the development of our stand-alone
     infrastructure, research and development activities, working capital
     requirements and other liabilities, and potential investments in, or
     acquisitions of, other businesses or technologies that would enable us
     to address gaps in our product offerings, secure new customers,
     diversify into complementary product markets and broaden our
     technological capabilities. We have not made specific allocations of the
     net proceeds for any of these subcategories and will only make such
     allocations from time to time following this offering as determined in
     the discretion of our management. However, we currently expect to use
     approximately $8 million to renovate laboratory and office space at our
     headquarters facility in Bedford, Massachusetts and approximately $14
     million in connection with the opening of a new manufacturing facility
     outside the United States. While we have no current commitments with
     respect to any future acquisitions, we frequently evaluate strategic
     opportunities and, subject to restrictions due to Section 355(e) and
     Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which may significantly
     limit our ability to issue shares of our common stock for acquisitions,
     we intend to actively pursue acquisitions and investments in
     complementary businesses.

   Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of a significant
portion of the net proceeds of this offering. You will not have the opportunity
to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which we base our
decisions on how to use this portion of the proceeds. Pending such uses, we
intend to invest this portion of the net proceeds of this offering to be
received by us in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

                                DIVIDEND POLICY

   We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development
and growth of our business. Therefore, we do not anticipate paying any cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.

   The following table sets forth our capitalization as of March 31, 2001. Our
capitalization is presented:

  .  on an actual basis; and

  .  on an as adjusted basis, assuming an initial public offering price of
     $16.00 per share, to reflect our receipt of the estimated net proceeds
     from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering of $101.0
     million and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described
     in "Use of Proceeds" to repay amounts owed to Millipore under the
     separation revolving credit agreement and the separation note of $26.0
     million.

   You should read the information set forth below together with "Selected
Financial Data," our historical combined financial statements and the notes to

                                    DILUTION

   Our net tangible book value at March 31, 2001 was approximately $210.4
million, or $6.47 per share. Net tangible book value per share is determined by
dividing our net tangible book value, which is total tangible assets less total
liabilities, by the number of shares of common stock outstanding immediately
before this offering. Tangible assets represent total assets excluding goodwill
and identifiable intangible assets. Dilution in net tangible book value per
share represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers
of shares of our common stock in this offering and the net tangible book value
per share of our common stock immediately afterwards. After giving effect to
our sale of 7,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed
initial public offering price of $16.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses payable by us and giving
effect to the application of the net proceeds as set forth above under "Use of
Proceeds," our as adjusted net tangible book value at March 31, 2001 would have
been approximately $285.4 million, or $7.23 per share. This represents an
immediate increase in net tangible book value of $0.76 per share to our
existing stockholder and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of
$8.77 per share to new investors purchasing shares of common stock in this
offering. The following table illustrates this dilution per share:

   The discussion and table above assume no exercise of options outstanding
under our stock option plans and no issuance of shares reserved for future
issuance under our stock option plans or employee stock purchase plan. As of
March 31, 2001, there were no options outstanding to purchase shares of our
common stock. However, following the distribution by Millipore of the shares of
our common stock owned by Millipore, we will assume unvested options to
purchase shares of Millipore common stock that are held by our directors,
officers and employees, which Millipore options will be converted into options
to purchase shares of our common stock at an exchange ratio based upon the
relative values of our shares of common stock and Millipore's shares of common
stock on the distribution date as more fully described under "Management--
Treatment of Millipore Options." As of March 31, 2001, our employees held
unvested options to purchase 807,353 shares of Millipore common stock at a
weighted average exercise price per share of $40.62. To the extent that any of
these options are exercised or any additional options are granted and
exercised, there will be further dilution to new investors.

   The following table summarizes as of March 31, 2001 the number of shares of
common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us and the
average price per share paid by Millipore and by new investors at an assumed
initial public offering price of $16.00 per share without giving effect to the
underwriting discounts and commissions and the assumed offering expenses:

                            SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

   The following table sets forth selected historical financial information
derived from our audited combined balance sheets at December 31, 1998, 1999 and
2000, and our audited combined statements of operations for the years then
ended and from our unaudited combined balance sheets at December 31, 1996 and
1997 and at March 31, 2001 and our unaudited combined statements of operations
for the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997 and the three months ended March
31, 2000 and 2001. The selected historical financial information includes
allocations of Millipore corporate expenses related to our business, including
centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits,
officers' salaries, real estate, insurance, information technology services,
distribution, treasury and other Millipore corporate and infrastructure costs.
These expense allocations have been determined on a basis that Millipore and we
consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided
or the benefit received by us. The pro forma earnings per share and share
information is based on historical information and gives effect to the number
of shares required to be issued, at an estimated offering price of $16.00 per
share, in order to obtain the amount of net proceeds required to repay amounts
owed to Millipore under the separation agreements. You should read our
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and our combined financial statements and related notes included
elsewhere in this prospectus for a further explanation of the financial data
summarized here.

   This selected financial information may not be indicative of our future
performance as a stand-alone company.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

   You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and
results of operations with the combined financial statements and notes to the
combined financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements and involves numerous risks and
uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described in the "Risk
Factors" section of this prospectus. Our actual results may differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Overview

   We are a worldwide developer, manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas
delivery systems, components and consumables used to precisely measure,
deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and chemicals, as well
as the deionized water, photoresists and vacuum systems, that are utilized in
the semiconductor manufacturing process. We also provide capital equipment
warranty and repair services to our customers. Our products include membrane
and metal-based filters, housings, precision liquid dispense filtration pumps,
resin-based gas purifiers and mass flow and pressure controllers. Mass flow and
pressure controllers provide precise measurement and control of mass flow rates
of gases that are introduced into the semiconductor and other electronics
manufacturing process chamber. Our products are used by our customers in
manufacturing operations to remove contaminants in process fluid streams and
process gas applications, to measure and control flow rates in process gas
streams and to control and monitor pressure and vacuum levels in process
chambers.

   Our products are sold globally through a direct sales force and through
distributors in selected regions. Our customers are located worldwide and we
currently manufacture our products worldwide at six sites located in the United
States, Japan and England. As part of our worldwide manufacturing
rationalization plan, we are in the process of relocating the operations of two
of these manufacturing facilities, in Bedford, Massachusetts and Jaffrey, New
Hampshire, and downsizing a third manufacturing facility, in Swindon, England.
We anticipate opening a new manufacturing facility outside the United States in
late 2001 or early 2002 and moving between 10% and 20% of our overall
manufacturing operations from our existing domestic and foreign manufacturing
facilities to this new facility over the next two to three years.

Our Separation from Millipore

   On October 3, 2000, Millipore announced its plan to spin-off a separate
company, initially named Millipore MicroElectronics, Inc. and subsequently
renamed Mykrolis Corporation, composed of Millipore's microelectronics business
which serves the semiconductor industry with products needed to manufacture
semiconductor devices. On October 16, 2000, Mykrolis Corporation was
incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millipore. Our
business historically has been operated as a fully integrated internal business
unit of Millipore. This offering will represent less than 20% of our capital
stock. Millipore has announced that it intends to distribute the shares of our
common stock that it owns to Millipore shareholders through a tax-free dividend
approximately six months following this offering. The distribution by Millipore
is subject to conditions, which may not occur by the contemplated time or at
all.

   Millipore transferred to us on March 31, 2001, referred to as the separation
date, substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the
microelectronics business. However, Millipore retained a limited number of our
assets and liabilities, including specified accounts payable and accounts
receivable outstanding as of the separation date, because it was impractical to
transfer these assets and liabilities to a different legal entity. Pursuant to
the separation revolving credit agreement, Millipore has provided us with a
line of credit to support our cash requirements between the separation date and
the consummation of this offering. In addition, at the separation date, we
entered into a separation note agreement with Millipore. The amount of the
separation note is contingent upon the amount of the offering proceeds and the
amount owed by us under the separation revolving credit agreement. The
separation note provides that the net proceeds of the offering, less all
expenses related to the initial public offering, less $75.0 million of offering
proceeds that we will retain to

                                       34
<PAGE>

fund our operations and less any amounts owed under the separation revolving
credit agreement, will be paid over to Millipore. The amount of the separation
note will be determined shortly before this offering. Immediately following
this offering, we will pay to Millipore any outstanding balances under the
separation revolving credit agreement and will repay the separation note.

   We entered into agreements with Millipore under which Millipore will provide
services to us during a transition period after the separation date. The
agreements relate to facilities services, information technology services,
distribution, accounting, finance and other services and arrangements. Under
these agreements, we will reimburse Millipore for the cost of these services.
The duration of each of the different transition services varies depending on
the anticipated time it will take for us to replace the service, but is
generally for a one-year period. In addition, we will enter into agreements
with Millipore for membrane manufacturing and supply, research and development,
product distribution and contract manufacturing, generally for a five-year
period. Many of the agreements, including those for facilities and information
technology services, may be extended beyond the initial transition period by
agreement of the parties. The agreements do not necessarily reflect the costs
of obtaining the services from unrelated third parties or of our providing the
applicable services ourselves. However, we believe that purchasing these
services from Millipore provides us with an efficient means of obtaining these
services during the transition period. In addition, we will provide transition
services to Millipore, for which we will be reimbursed at our cost.

   We must also negotiate new agreements with various third parties as a
separate, stand-alone entity, such as the agreements for our new manufacturing
facility outside the United States and the arrangements for our information
technology application hosting services. There can be no assurance that the
terms we will be able to negotiate for these agreements will be as favorable as
those we enjoyed as part of Millipore. In addition, as part of Millipore, we
benefited from various economies of scale including shared global
administrative functions, facilities and volume purchase discounts. We expect
that our costs and expenses will increase as a result of the loss of these
economies of scale, although the amount is not determinable at this time.

Restructuring and Other Charges and Non-recurring Separation Expenses

   During the first quarter of 2001, we recorded restructuring and other
charges of $12.6 million in connection with our separation from Millipore to
improve our manufacturing asset utilization and resize our overall cost
structure. The restructuring and other charges included $11.3 million of
employee severance costs, a $1.0 million write-off of equipment and leasehold
improvements and $0.3 million of lease cancellation costs. Key initiatives of
the restructuring program included:

  . Consolidating manufacturing operations to eliminate redundant
    manufacturing processes. We are in the process of relocating the
    operations of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United States
    and downsizing our manufacturing facility in England. The consolidation
    of our manufacturing operations is expected to be completed in the first
    quarter of 2002. We also anticipate opening a new manufacturing facility
    outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and moving between
    10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations from our existing
    domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new facility over
    the next two to three years.

  . Realigning our European organizational structure to focus on our
    operating business units, thereby consolidating our sales and
    administrative activities into fewer locations that are closer to our
    customer base. We expect to complete this transition during 2001.

  . Reducing our administrative and management infrastructure costs in Asia.
    These cost reductions are expected to result in lower overhead for
    administrative and management infrastructure in Asia and will be achieved
    through reduced facility costs and administrative positions during 2001.

  . Reducing our workforce in the U.S. in order to address anticipated
    changes in the demand for our products due to the current semiconductor
    industry downturn.

   The restructuring initiatives resulted in the elimination of 205 positions
worldwide. Notification to employees was completed in the first quarter of
2001. However, a number of these employees will continue in their existing
positions through the first quarter of 2002 with their related salary costs
charged to operations as

                                       35
<PAGE>

incurred. In the first quarter of 2001, approximately $6.1 million of
restructuring reserve, consisting primarily of severance and associated
benefits for 77 employees, was utilized. At March 31, 2001, approximately
$6.5 million of restructuring costs remained accrued. We believe that such
amounts will be substantially paid by the end of the first quarter of 2002. The
restructuring program is expected to yield annualized savings of approximately
$8.8 million. The savings will result from reduced wages, facility related
costs and depreciation. The savings will be reflected in costs of sales,
selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development
expenses. The savings began in the second quarter of 2001 but are not expected
to be fully realized until the first quarter of 2002.

   In addition, in connection with our separation from Millipore and the
implementation of our worldwide manufacturing strategy, we expect to incur
incremental, non-recurring operating costs and expenses which, we estimate,
could amount to approximately $17.5 million over a three-year period from 2001
to 2003. These anticipated costs and expenses are associated with the
following:

  .  continued implementation of our manufacturing strategy, including our
     plan to open a manufacturing facility outside of the United States and
     to relocate production activities to the new facility. We anticipate
     that these expenses will total approximately $7.0 million and will
     include severance costs, retention bonuses and increased depreciation
     due to decreases in the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and
     leasehold improvements. The majority of these costs will be incurred in
     2001 and 2002.

  .  other separation-related costs and expenses including legal fees,
     increased marketing expenses related to establishing a new brand
     identity, retention bonuses, increased depreciation due to decreases in
     the estimated useful lives of fixed assets and leasehold improvements.
     These costs and expenses totaled $3.5 million in the three months ended
     March 31, 2001. Through the end of 2002, we anticipate incurring
     additional similar costs and expenses totaling approximately $7.0
     million.

   We will also incur other third party costs, fees and expenses relating to
our separation from Millipore. Such costs, fees and expenses include, among
others, start-up costs related to designing and constructing our computer
infrastructure and implementing treasury, real estate, pension and records
retention management services. We expect to outsource these services and
functions and will need to negotiate service agreements with new service
providers. We expect these future costs to be consistent with the historical
costs incurred for these services.

Basis of Presentation

   Our combined financial statements have been prepared using Millipore's
historical bases in the assets and liabilities and our historical results of
operations include allocations of Millipore corporate expenses described below.
Management believes the assumptions underlying the preparation of the combined
financial statements are reasonable. However, the financial information
included here may not necessarily reflect the combined financial position,
operating results, changes in our invested equity and cash flows in the future
or what they would have been had we been a separate, stand-alone entity during
the periods presented.

   Our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade
discounts and allowances. We recognize revenue when contractual obligations
have been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the
customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.
Revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided. Our service
revenue was less than 3.0% of total net sales for each of the three years ended
December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and each of the three months ended March 31,
2000 and 2001.

   Millipore uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing
of its operations. Our cash deposits are transferred to Millipore on a regular
basis and netted against Millipore's net investment. As a result, none of
Millipore's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the corporate level have been
allocated to us. Changes in invested equity include our net earnings, net cash
transfers to Millipore and other transfers from Millipore.

   The combined financial statements include allocations of Millipore corporate
expenses, including centralized research and development, legal, accounting,
employee benefits, officers' salaries, real estate, insurance, information
technology services, distribution, treasury and other Millipore corporate and

                                       36
<PAGE>

infrastructure costs. These expense allocations have been determined on a basis
that Millipore and we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization
of services provided or the benefit received by us. The allocation methods
include relative sales, headcount, square footage and specific identification.
Since the separation date, we have been performing these functions using our
own resources or through purchased services, including services obtained from
Millipore pursuant to a transition services agreement.

   Allocated costs included in the accompanying combined statements of
operations are as follows:

Recent Developments

   The semiconductor industry in which we participate is highly cyclical. A
downturn, which began in the middle of 1996, continued into early 1999. Since
then, we recorded eight sequential quarters of increased sales during 1999 and
2000. However, recent industry results and published reports indicate that an
industry wide decline has begun. Because of the recent downturn in the
semiconductor industry, we experienced a significant decline in our revenues in
the first and second quarters of 2001. Our net sales in the first quarter of
2001 were $83.0 million, representing a $17.0 million, or 17.0%, decline from
our net sales in the fourth quarter of 2000. In addition, on July 20, 2001,
Millipore Corporation announced its unaudited consolidated results of
operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2001. In that announcement Millipore
reported our net sales in the second

                                       37
<PAGE>

quarter of 2001 of $56.4 million, representing a 35% decrease compared to our
net sales of $86.2 million in the second quarter of 2000, and a decrease of
32%, or 30% in local currencies, compared to the first quarter of 2001.
Millipore also reported a net loss before income taxes for us for the second
quarter of 2001 of $6.2 million. Our 2001 first and second quarter financial
information reflects a negative currency effect on both sales and profitability
due to the declining value of the Japanese yen and the Euro versus the US
dollar. Millipore's announcement also reflected its microelectronics business
as a discontinued operation and Millipore reported a loss on the disposal of
our business of $35.1 million before income taxes. This amount includes our
estimated operating loss through the anticipated distribution date of $27.8
million and the estimated costs to dispose of our business of $7.3 million.

   In addition, in the second quarter of 2001, our net cash used in operating
activities was $11.6 million as compared to a net cash provided by operating
activities of $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2001. The net increase in
cash used in operating activities resulted from a combination of the
continuation of the industry-wide downturn affecting the microelectronics
industry and our business; the growth in inventory of $4.5 million during the
quarter; and the effect of our separation arrangements with Millipore, which
affected the timing of our collection of accounts receivable. Our separation
arrangements included the exchange of our U.S. accounts receivable for
Millipore Asian accounts receivable having substantially equivalent value. This
exchange was made because it was not practical to transfer back to Millipore
the accounts receivable of the former Millipore Asian subsidiaries transferred
to us in the separation. We believe that the quality of the Asian accounts we
received is at least equivalent to the quality of the U.S. accounts that we
exchanged. As a general matter, regional business practices in Asia result in
longer collection periods for accounts receivable than in the U.S. We expect
that our net cash from operating activities in the third quarter of 2001 will
be positively impacted by the collection of these Millipore Asian receivables.


   The cash used in operating activities during the second quarter resulted in
an increase in the balance under the separation revolving credit agreement.
This will result in a corresponding decrease in the amount payable under the
separation note at the time of the offering. As a result, our cash position
following the offering ($75 million) and the payment to Millipore of all
amounts owing under our separation agreements (all net proceeds in excess of
$75 million) remains unchanged. We believe that the net proceeds of the
offering, after payment of the amounts due to Millipore under the separation
agreements, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to
satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure, restructuring and research
and development requirements for the next eighteen months.


   We are continuing to experience softening demand for our liquid and gas
delivery systems, components and consumables from a number of our large
customers. These customers have rescheduled or cancelled orders as they
attempt, we believe, to manage their inventories in response to weakness in
their markets. As a result, we anticipate our revenues and our operating income
to decrease in 2001. We continually review our overall cost and expense
structure, our workforce levels and our production schedules in response to our
anticipated revenues and expect to respond to changes in the demand for our
products and changes in our revenues as necessary, particularly through expense
controls and limitations on discretionary spending. There can be no assurance
as to the extent or duration of this cyclical downturn or as to its impact on
us.

Three Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2000

   Net Sales. During the first quarter of 2001, net sales increased 6.9%
compared to the same period last year. Sales growth was most significant in
Europe and Asia while sales remained flat in North America and Japan. Sales
were down 17.0% in the first quarter of 2001 compared to the fourth quarter of
2000. Although recently published industry results and forecasts predict
continued declines in demand for both semiconductors and semiconductor capital
equipment for at least the remainder of 2001, the extent and the duration of
this industry downturn is unknown. Sales and sales growth by geography are
summarized in the table below.

   Gross Profit Margins. Gross profit margins decreased from 51.0% in the first
quarter of 2000 to 47.6% in the first quarter of 2001. The decrease is
primarily due to anticipated reduction in product demand and related reduced
production volumes. We have responded to this change in demand during the first
quarter of 2001 by restructuring our manufacturing operations as a result of
the industry downturn.

   Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses increased in the first quarter of
2001 by $15.6 million as compared to the first quarter of 2000. Excluding the
impact of restructuring and other charges of $12.6 million and $3.5 million of
non-recurring separation-related costs and expenses, operating expenses
decreased $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2001. As a percentage of net
sales, operating expenses excluding restructuring and other charges and
separation-related expenses decreased from 36.1% in the first quarter of 2000
to 33.2% in the first quarter of 2001 as a result of strict discretionary
containment measures. We expect to incur costs and expenses as we continue to
implement our manufacturing strategy and our separation from Millipore and
develop our own infrastructure. Although the aggregate amount of these expenses
is not determinable at this time, we expect to incur approximately $8.8 million
of additional incremental non-recurring operating costs and expenses in 2001
and an aggregate of $5.2 million in 2002 and 2003 associated with our
separation from Millipore.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.0% during the
first quarter of 2001 to $25.2 million compared to $23.0 million during the
first quarter of 2000. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and
administrative expenses increased from 29.6% in the first quarter of 2000 to
30.4% in the first quarter of 2001.

   Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense, net includes foreign currency
transaction exchange gains and losses as well as gains and losses on
investments in 20%-50% owned entities accounted for under the equity method.

   Provision for Income Taxes. Income taxes were calculated as if we filed tax
returns separately from Millipore. However, Millipore was managing its tax
position for the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses, and its tax
strategies are not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that we would
have followed or will follow as a stand-alone company.

<PAGE>


   Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2001 and 2000 was 35% and
38%, respectively. This provision for income taxes on a pre-tax loss in the
first quarter of 2001 is due to net operating losses incurred in the United
States for which we have provided no tax benefit and taxable income in certain
foreign jurisdictions. We will continue to evaluate our tax position throughout
2001 and may find it necessary to adjust our effective tax rate in subsequent
quarters depending on the geographic mix of our earnings, the continued
development of our tax strategies during the year, and in light of the fact
that we will be included in the Millipore consolidated tax return until the
date that Millipore distributes our shares to its stockholders.


Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Years Ended December 31, 1999 and 1998

   Net Sales. During 2000, net sales increased 72.3% to $355.5 million from
$206.3 million in 1999 and during 1999 increased 14.2% from $180.6 million in
1998. The net sales increase in both years was primarily due to a recovery in
the semiconductor industry as well as the impact of our new product
introductions. Beginning in the middle of 1997 and continuing throughout 1998,
the semiconductor industry entered a cyclical downturn. This resulted in a
decline in microelectronics hardware sales as new semiconductor plant
construction and upgrades declined due to industry overcapacity. In addition,
sales of consumable purification products also declined, although to a lesser
extent, as semiconductor fabrication plants focused on achieving manufacturing
efficiencies and reducing materials costs. During 1999, the industry came out
of this downturn and the Asian economies rebounded. By 2000, semiconductor
manufacturing volumes as well as our sales achieved record levels.

   Sales and sales growth by geography are summarized in the table below. Local
currency sales growth represents the growth in sales based on the foreign
currency balances translated, in all periods presented, at Millipore's 2000
budgeted exchange rates, thereby excluding the impact of fluctuations in the
actual foreign currency rates. Management uses this presentation to evaluate
sales growth because we believe that the local currency results provide a
clearer presentation of the underlying sales trends.

   As a general matter, a weaker U.S. dollar will favorably affect our sales
growth. During 2000 as compared to 1999, the Japanese yen strengthened against
the U.S. dollar by approximately 5% and the Euro weakened against the U.S.
dollar by approximately 15%. The net effect of currency translation in 2000,
including the impact of the declining Euro and the stronger Japanese yen,
resulted in an increase in reported sales growth by 1.8% over the preceding
year. Similarly, in 1999, the net effect of currency translation, including the
impact of the Japanese yen strengthening against the U.S. dollar by
approximately 13% and the Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar by
approximately 5% during the year, resulted in an increase in reported sales
growth of 5.5%.

   Gross Profit Margins. Gross profit margins were 50.9% in 2000, 48.1% in 1999
and 33.5% in 1998. Gross profit margins of 50.9% were higher in 2000 than in
prior years primarily due to increased operating leverage resulting from higher
production volume and manufacturing yield, partially offset by the inflationary
impact of major electronic component shortages. In 1999, gross profit margins
of 48.1% were lower than in 2000 primarily as a result of lower production
volumes. However, 1999 gross profit margins benefited from savings realized
from restructuring initiatives, which began in the third quarter of 1998 when
we recorded a restructuring reserve and consolidated four redundant facilities
into our Allen, Texas facility. During 1998, gross profit margins, excluding
unusual items, were 37.5%. The unusual items recorded in 1998 as part of the
restructuring initiatives were a $1.2 million charge for the write-off of
inventory and manufacturing equipment associated with our product line
rationalization activities and a $6.0 million charge for the write-off of
excess and obsolete inventory. Excluding these unusual items, gross profit
margin percentages were depressed in 1998, as a result of significantly reduced
volumes in manufacturing plants due to the downturn in sales and our
duplicative manufacturing facilities. These duplicative manufacturing costs
resulted from concurrent operations at three existing plants located in
California and Texas which we acquired in our acquisition of Tylan General,
Inc. in 1997 and the start up of operations at our then new manufacturing
facility in Allen, Texas.

   Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses increased 27.9% in 2000 from
$93.2 million in 1999 to $119.2 million and decreased 9.3% in 1999 from $102.7
million in 1998. Excluding the impact of restructuring items and a litigation
settlement, operating expenses grew 26.6% in 2000 from $94.4 million in 1999 to
$119.5 million and grew 2.7% in 1999 from $91.9 million in 1998. As a
percentage of net sales, operating expenses, excluding restructuring items and
litigation settlement, decreased to 33.6% in 2000 from 45.8% in 1999 and 50.9%
in 1998.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 28.4% in 2000 to
$96.4 million from $75.1 million in 1999 and 6.7% in 1999 from $70.4 million in
1998. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased to 27.1% in 2000 from 36.4% in 1999 and 39.0% in 1998. In
2000, we invested in sales, customer support and marketing resources. These
investments were undertaken to maintain and improve our customer service,
support the launch of new products, develop future sales initiatives and
improve our competitive position. In 2000, the strong sales and profit
performances resulted in increased incentive compensation payments. The
increased spending in 1999 as compared to 1998 was planned to respond to the
increased sales volume in 1999 and anticipated continued growth in 2000, while
partially offset by cost saving programs derived from the 1998 restructuring
activities.

   Research and development expenses increased 19.7% in 2000 to $23.1 million
from $19.3 million in 1999 and decreased 10.2% in 1999 from $21.5 million in
1998. During 2000, we focused on novel technology development and licensing for
advanced copper interconnect and photolithography applications. Additional
investments were made to develop in-house copper plating capability. We also
focused on photochemical dispense systems, which are specifically designed to
address advanced deep ultraviolet photolithography. In 1999, the decrease was
primarily due to the elimination of research and development expenses for non-
strategic product lines and consolidation into our Allen, Texas facility in
order to eliminate duplicative development programs.

   1998 Restructuring Program and Provision for Excess Inventory. In the second
quarter of 1998, Millipore announced a restructuring program to improve its
competitive position by streamlining worldwide operations and reducing its
overall cost structure.

   Key initiatives of the restructuring program that affected us included:

  .  discontinuance of non-strategic product lines and rationalization of
     product offerings to improve our product line focus. The non-strategic
     product lines consisted of semiconductor fabrication plant monitoring
     and control software and various filtration devices. These actions were
     completed by September 30, 1998.

  .  renegotiation of marketing, research and development, and supply
     agreements. These actions were completed during 1999.

                                       41
<PAGE>

   In the third quarter of 1998, our portion of the restructuring expense
associated with these activities totaled $8.3 million and included a
restructuring charge of $7.1 million, a $0.8 million charge for inventory
write-offs and a $0.4 million charge for write-offs of fixed assets against
cost of sales. The $7.1 million restructuring charge included $5.0 million of
employee severance costs, a $1.4 million write-off of real and intangible
assets associated with discontinued product lines and $0.7 million of contract
termination costs as part of the termination of rights under a technology
development collaboration agreement.

   We reevaluated the accrual for the restructuring program, and in the third
quarters of 1999 and 2000 we reversed $1.2 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, of the remaining balance. The reversals reflected lower estimates
for severance costs attributed to higher levels of attrition than originally
anticipated and affected employees filling open positions at Millipore that
resulted from improved business conditions. These restructuring initiatives
combined with the consolidation of our plants resulted in the elimination of
460 positions worldwide.

   During the third quarter of 1998, we also recorded in cost of sales an
incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory of $6.0 million in
response to adverse changes in demand attributable to declining business
conditions in Asia and the slowdown in the semiconductor industry.

   Benefits from the restructuring program and our plant consolidation resulted
in savings of approximately $28 million in 1999. The savings resulted from
reduced wages, amortization and lower cost of products and were reflected
primarily as reductions in cost of sales. Additional spending as a result of
increased volume through manufacturing plants offset these savings.

   Litigation Settlement. In 1998, we recorded a charge of approximately $3.7
million for the settlement of a patent lawsuit with Mott Metallurgical
Corporation in which each party claimed infringement of one of its patents by
the other. As part of the settlement, the parties agreed to cross license the
two patents at issue.

   Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense, net includes foreign currency
transaction exchange gains and losses as well as gains and losses on
investments in 20%-50% owned entities accounted for under the equity method. In
2000, other expense, net included the write-off of a cost method investment in
a privately held company.

   Provision for Income Taxes. Our effective tax rate, calculated on a separate
return basis, for 2000, 1999 and 1998 was 38%, 45% and 37%, respectively. The
rate is based on our earnings before taxes in the various tax jurisdictions in
which we operate throughout the world. The 45% tax rate in 1999 resulted from
the impact of our non-tax deductible goodwill amortization in combination with
a low pretax profit.

Quarterly Results of Operations

   We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant
fluctuations in our quarterly results. Our expense levels are based, in part,
on expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels in a particular quarter
do not meet expectations, operating results are adversely affected. The
following table sets forth our unaudited operating results for our last nine
quarters. The information has been derived from our unaudited combined
financial statements that, in our opinion, reflect all normal, recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation. The operating results for any
quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

   Historically, Millipore has managed our overall capital requirements on a
centralized basis including management of cash and debt. Millipore has retained
cash receipts associated with our business on a daily basis and has provided
funds to cover our disbursements. Accordingly, we have reported neither cash or
cash equivalents nor debt at December 31, 1998, 1999 or 2000 or March 31, 2000
or 2001.

   Millipore has provided a line of credit to us pursuant to a separation
revolving credit agreement to support our cash requirements between the
separation date and the date of this offering. From the net proceeds of this
offering, after payment of associated costs to complete the transaction, we
will pay to Millipore any outstanding balances under the separation revolving
credit agreement, we will retain $75.0 million for general corporate purposes,
and we will pay to Millipore the remaining net proceeds from the offering,
which will constitute the amount due under the separation note. See
"Arrangements between Mykrolis and Millipore--Separation Revolving Credit
Agreement and Separation Note."

   Our cash flows from operations reflected a net use of cash of approximately
$6.0 million during the first quarter of 2000 compared to cash provided by
operations of $3.3 million during the first quarter of 2001. In the first
quarter of 2001, our cash flows provided by operations consisted of uses of
cash associated with our restructuring actions of $2.1 million and an increase
in inventory of $9.0 million, more than offset by a reduction in accounts
receivable of $13.5 million. The decrease in accounts receivable can be
attributed to ongoing collection efforts and decreased sales volume. Inventory
growth related to raw material purchase commitments made in the fourth quarter
of 2000 to meet anticipated capacity needs for the first quarter of 2001.

   Our cash flows from operations reflected a net use of cash of $10.0 million,
$1.4 million and $5.1 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
increase in cash flows used in operations in 2000 was primarily attributed to
growth in accounts receivable and inventory due to a significant sales volume
increase that more than offset increased net income. The growth in accounts
receivable was due to the increase in net sales in Japan and Asia where
regional business practices result in longer collection periods. We continue to
aggressively manage our collection activities. Inventory levels increased due
to stocking levels of new products and efforts to increase customer service
levels through increased product availability.

   The net use of cash from operations in 1999 of $1.4 million was primarily
attributed to an increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels as a
result of an increase in sales volume, which more than offset improved net
income and increased accounts payable. The net use of cash from operations in
1998 of $5.1 million was primarily attributed to the cash disbursements related
to the 1998 restructuring programs.

   Cash flow used in investing activities consists of capital expenditures for
property, plant and equipment of $2.2 million, $11.8 million, $4.2 million and
$31.8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2001 and the years ended
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Expenditures in 2000 were $7.6
million higher than in 1999 due to additional spending on machinery and
equipment in our Allen, Texas, Jaffrey, New Hampshire, Bedford, Massachusetts
and Yonezawa, Japan facilities to increase manufacturing capacity. In 1998, as
part of a plant consolidation and production expansion plan, we invested $28.0
million in the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Allen, Texas. We
expect that capital expenditures for 2001 will be approximately $30.0 million
and will include the necessary capital expenditures to support our normal
operations, approximately $8 million for the renovation of our headquarters
facility and approximately $14 million for the start-up of a new manufacturing
site outside the United States.

   Millipore has used a centralized approach to cash management in the
financing of its operations. Our financing activities consisted of $1.1 million
of net cash transfers to Millipore in the three months ended March 31, 2001.
The cash flow from financing activities in the years ended December 31, 1998,
1999 and 2000 reflect net cash transfers from Millipore of $21.9 million in
2000, $5.6 million in 1999 and $36.9 million in 1998. The cash flows from
financing activities reflect changes in the amount of cash financing from
Millipore required to fund our capital expenditures and operating activities.

   Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on the
normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from
uncertainties related to global economies. We believe that the net proceeds of
the offering, after payment of the amounts due to Millipore as described above,
together with cash

                                       44
<PAGE>

generated from operations, will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital,
capital expenditure, restructuring and research and development requirements
for the next eighteen months. We expect that our cash flow needs beyond the
next eighteen months will be satisfied through cash flow generated from
operations together with borrowings under a short-term line of credit that we
expect to obtain following this offering in an amount of up to $35 million.
Pursuant to the terms of the lease for our Bedford, Massachusetts headquarters
facility, the landlord has an option to sell the facility to us at any time
prior to November 2005, the end of the lease term, at 90% of the then current
fair market value. We estimate that the current fair market value of the
facility is approximately $15.8 million. If our cash flows from operations are
less than we expect, we may need to incur debt or issue additional equity. Also
we may need to incur debt or issue equity to make a strategic acquisition or
investment. Prior to the distribution, our ability to incur debt will be
limited by the covenants in Millipore's existing debt agreements. With limited
exceptions, the terms of Millipore's revolving credit agreement will prohibit
us from creating or incurring any lien on our properties or assets prior to the
time that Millipore owns less than 50% of our capital stock. Similarly, the
indentures governing Millipore's publicly-traded bonds prohibit us, until such
time as Millipore owns less than 50% of our capital stock, from creating or
incurring any lien on our properties or assets unless Millipore's bonds are
secured by an equal and ratable lien on the same properties or assets.
In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary
short-term or other financing on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to
obtain necessary financing, we may not have sufficient cash to operate our
business.

Revolving Credit Facility

   Based upon discussions with Fleet National Bank and Fleet Securities, Inc.,
we expect to enter into a revolving credit facility in connection with this
offering. In order for us to enter into the revolving credit facility prior to
the distribution, Millipore will need to obtain consent from the lenders under
its debt agreements. We expect that the revolving credit facility will provide
for borrowings of up to $35 million and have a final maturity in 2004. We
anticipate that the revolving credit facility will be secured by substantially
all of our assets. To date, no definitive agreement has been executed, and no
assurance can be given that Millipore will obtain the required consents or that
the revolving credit facility will be executed on these terms or entered into
at all.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure Relating to Market Risks

   We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales
commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Historically, our exposure to exchange
rate risk has been managed on an enterprise-wide basis as part of Millipore's
risk management strategy. Millipore manages these market risks through its
normal financing and operating activities and, when appropriate, through the
use of derivative financial instruments. We do not currently hold derivative
financial instruments and are currently evaluating our future hedging strategy.

   Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We sell our products in many countries
and a substantial portion of our net sales and a portion of our costs and
expenses are denominated in foreign currencies. Approximately 64% and 61% of
our net sales in the three months ended March 31, 2001 and the year ended
December 31, 2000, respectively, were derived from customers outside of the
United States, principally in Asia. This business is transacted through our
network of international operations and is generally conducted in the local
currency. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will
continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. This exposes
us to risks associated with changes in foreign currency that can adversely
impact revenues, net income and cash flow. Approximately 52% of our net sales
in the three months ended March 31, 2001 and in the year ended December 31,
2000 were derived from Asia, including Japan, where, on average, the yen
strengthened against the U.S. dollar during 2000 and 1999 but is currently
experiencing a weakening against the U.S. dollar. Generally a stronger yen has
a favorable impact on our net revenue growth and an adverse effect on our
operating expense growth. We are exposed to changes in the Japanese yen that
cannot be mitigated through normal operating activities. Accordingly, Millipore
has managed the net equity exposure risk through the use of debt swap
agreements. However, these positions have not been transferred to us. In
addition, approximately 9% of our net sales in 2000 were derived from Europe
where, on average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro during 2000
and 1999. Continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro may
adversely affect our net revenue growth and favorably impact our operating
expense growth.

                                       45
<PAGE>

   Credit Risk. We are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk,
principally in accounts receivable, as historically we have relied on a limited
number of customers for a substantial portion of our net sales. We perform
ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and we generally do not require
collateral. Our major customers are large, well-established microelectronics
companies that have historically paid their accounts receivable balances with
us.

   Interest Rate Risk. Millipore will retain all of its debt. Therefore, no
debt has been directly attributed to us. Accordingly, we have not historically
been exposed to interest rate risk.

   Implementation of the Euro. On January 1, 1999, 11 member countries of the
European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing
sovereign "legacy" currencies, and adopted the Euro as their new common legal
currency. As of that date, the Euro began trading on currency exchanges and the
legacy currencies will remain legal tender in the participating countries for a
transition period between January 1, 1999 and January 1, 2002. In the first
quarter of 1999, we began, where applicable, invoicing customers and
intercompany transactions in the Euro. In connection with the transition to the
Euro, we assessed and have adjusted our pricing/marketing strategy over the
past three years in order to ensure that we remain competitive in a broader
European market. We have fully implemented these adjustments and do not
anticipate any future costs associated with these adjustments. Furthermore, we
commenced a plan to upgrade our computer applications to enable business
transactions to be executed correctly in the Euro effective January 1, 2002.
Millipore acquired the license to this upgrade in 1999 and the costs associated
with this license were split between Millipore and us at the separation
pursuant to the terms of our separation agreements.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

   In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets" effective January 1, 2002. SFAS 142 requires, among other things, the
cessation of the amortization of goodwill. In addition, the standard includes
provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles
as goodwill, reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized
intangibles, reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported
goodwill and the identification of reporting units for purposes of assessing
potential future impairments of goodwill. SFAS 142 also requires us to complete
a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption.
We are currently assessing the impact of this new statement on our combined
financial position and results of operations and have not yet determined the
impact of adoption.

   In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, or SAB 101, "Revenue Recognition". SAB 101
summarizes the staff's view in applying generally accepted accounting
principles to revenue recognition. We adopted SAB 101 as of January 1, 2000.
The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or
results of operations.

   In March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Interpretation 44, or FIN 44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving
Stock Compensation--an interpretation of Accounting Principles Board Opinion
25, or APB Opinion 25. FIN 44 clarifies the application of APB Opinion 25 and
among other issues clarifies the following: the definition of an employee for
purposes of applying APB Opinion 25; the criteria for determining whether a
plan qualifies as a non-compensatory plan; the accounting consequence of
various modifications to the terms of previously fixed stock options or awards;
and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards in a business
combination. FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000, but a few conclusions in FIN 44
cover specific events that occurred after either December 15, 1998 or January
12, 2000. The application of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on our
financial position or results of operations.

   In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" effective January 1, 2001. SFAS 133
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative
instrument, including derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be
recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its
fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivative's fair
value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are
met. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS 138, which amended provisions of SFAS
133. We adopted these pronouncements effective January 1, 2001, and they did
not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

                                    BUSINESS

Overview

   We are a worldwide developer, manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas
delivery systems, components and consumables used to precisely measure,
deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and chemicals, as well
as the deionized water, photoresists and vacuum systems, that are utilized in
the semiconductor manufacturing process. In addition, our products are used to
manufacture a range of other products, such as flat panel displays, high purity
chemicals, photoresists, solar cells, gas lasers, optical and magnetic storage
devices and fiber optic cables.

   We offer thousands of products grouped in 250 product categories, including
more than 2,500 consumable products. Our consumables are those products, such
as filters for liquid and gas processes, that are used by our customers in the
manufacturing process and which require periodic replacement to maintain the
purity and precision of the manufacturing process. Our products use
purification technologies to remove particles, ions and molecules from liquid
and gas streams, as well as electro-mechanical, pressure differential and
related technologies, to permit semiconductor and other electronics
manufacturers to monitor and control the flow and condition of liquids, gases
and vacuum systems used in these manufacturing processes. Our specially
designed proprietary filters remove sub-micron sized particles and bubbles from
the different chemical fluid streams, typically liquid or gas, that are used in
the manufacturing process.

   The increasing complexity of semiconductor devices has resulted in the need
for more complex, higher-precision liquid and gas delivery, measurement,
control and purification systems. The ability of semiconductor device
manufacturers to offer integrated circuits with smaller geometries, greater
functionality and higher performance at a lower cost requires continuous
improvements in semiconductor process equipment, process controls and liquid
and gas delivery systems. Manufacturing a semiconductor can require hundreds of
process steps, many of which involve the precise measurement, delivery, control
and purification of process liquids, gases and other chemicals. The design and
performance of those liquid and gas delivery systems, subsystems, components
and consumables are critical to the semiconductor manufacturing process because
they directly affect cost of ownership and manufacturing yield.

   As equipment and process complexity in semiconductor manufacturing
increases, semiconductor original equipment manufacturers and device
manufacturers are seeking to improve time-to-market, reduce manufacturing costs
and improve production quality and reliability and long-term service and
support. To address these issues, semiconductor equipment companies and device
manufacturers are outsourcing the design and manufacture of liquid and gas
delivery, measurement, control and purification systems, components, and
consumables to us and to other well-established subsystem and component
companies that have worldwide presence and leading technologies.

   We have been selling our filtration products to semiconductor device
manufacturers since 1978, and we believe that we currently offer the most
comprehensive range of filtration, purification, dispense, pressure and vacuum
measurement and control products serving the semiconductor industry. We are an
integrated multinational manufacturer, and we sell our products and services to
semiconductor device manufacturers, as well as to original equipment
manufacturers and materials suppliers to those companies. We have been a
pioneer in the field of filtration and purification products and have been
instrumental in the development of many industry innovations for over two
decades.

   We have an extensive installed base for our products with industry leading
customers worldwide. We sell our products primarily through our direct sales
force located in over 25 offices worldwide, and we currently have manufacturing
facilities in the United States, Japan and England. We are in the process of
relocating the operations of two of our manufacturing facilities in the United
States and downsizing our manufacturing facility in England as part of our
worldwide manufacturing rationalization plan. We anticipate opening a new
manufacturing facility outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and
moving between 10% and 20% of our overall

                                       47
<PAGE>

manufacturing operations from our existing domestic and foreign manufacturing
facilities to this new facility over the next two to three years. We also have
a network of service and support facilities to serve our customers worldwide.
Our customers include most major semiconductor device manufacturers and
semiconductor equipment suppliers in the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Korea
and Europe, as well as other electronic device manufacturers.

   Whereas demand for semiconductor capital equipment has historically
fluctuated based, in part, on the cyclical production schedules at
semiconductor manufacturing facilities, the volume of semiconductors and other
manufactured electronic devices has been more constant. This industry trend,
when coupled with the fact that consumable products require more frequent
replacement than capital equipment components, has led to a more consistent
demand for our consumable products.

Industry Background

   The semiconductor industry has grown considerably in recent years and,
although highly cyclical, is expected to continue to grow rapidly, primarily as
a result of the increasing demand for digital consumer electronics,
communications equipment and computers. Gartner, Inc., an independent market
research company, reported that the worldwide semiconductor market is expected
to grow from approximately $188 billion in 2001 to approximately $337 billion
in 2005, representing a compound annual growth rate of approximately 16%.

   Much of this growth has been facilitated by dramatic improvements in
semiconductor manufacturing technologies which have enabled semiconductor
manufacturers to produce smaller, faster, more complex and higher performance
semiconductors, while steadily reducing the cost per function. To satisfy the
growing demand for semiconductors and to accommodate new manufacturing
technologies, semiconductor manufacturers have added new equipment and have
built new manufacturing facilities. Gartner, Inc. estimates that the worldwide
semiconductor capital spending market is expected to grow from approximately
$47 billion in 2001 to approximately $92 billion in 2005, representing a
compound annual growth rate of approximately 18%.

   Moreover, we believe that semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers are
outsourcing a significant portion of their production to component and sub-
assembly companies and that the demand for outsourced semiconductor capital
equipment components and subassemblies will grow at an even faster rate than
the semiconductor capital equipment market as a whole.

   The extensive and complex process of turning bare silicon wafers into
finished integrated circuits is dependent upon a variety of materials, such as
liquids, gases, chemicals, metals and filters, which are used repeatedly
through the manufacturing process. Semiconductor unit volume is the primary
demand driver for these process materials and products because they are used or
consumed during the production process and require replacement or replenishment
on a regular basis. As a result, the market for consumables is less cyclical
than the semiconductor capital equipment market.

The Semiconductor Manufacturing Process

   The manufacturing of semiconductors and other electronic devices can require
hundreds of process steps. These steps take place within a process chamber,
which provides a controlled environment for the fabrication of semiconductor
and other electronic devices. The primary processing steps in the manufacture
of semiconductors are:

   Deposition. Deposition refers to placing layers of insulating or conductive
materials on a wafer surface in thin films that make up the circuit elements of
semiconductor devices. The two main deposition processes are physical vapor
deposition, where a thin film is deposited on a wafer surface in a low-pressure
gas environment, and chemical vapor deposition, where a thin film is deposited
on a wafer surface using a gas medium and a chemical bonding process. In
addition, electro-plating technology is utilized for the deposition of

                                       48
<PAGE>

low resistance materials such as copper. The control of uniformity and
thickness of these films through filtration and purification of the fluids and
materials used during the process is critical to the performance of the
semiconductor circuit and, consequently, the manufacturing yield.

   Chemical Mechanical Planarization. Chemical mechanical planarization
flattens, or planarizes, the topography of the film surface to permit the
patterning of small features on the resulting smooth surface by the
photolithography process. Semiconductor manufacturers need filtration and
purification systems to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields through the
chemical mechanical planarization process by filtering the liquid slurries,
which are solutions containing abrasive particles in a chemical mixture, to
remove oversized particles and contaminants that can cause defects on a wafer's
surface while not affecting the functioning of the abrasive particles in the
liquid slurries.

   Photolithography. Photolithography is the process step that defines the
patterns of the circuits to be built on the chip. Before photolithography, a
wafer is pre-coated with photoresist, a light sensitive film composed of ultra-
high purity chemicals in liquid form. The photoresist is exposed to specific
forms of radiation, such as ultraviolet light, electrons or x-rays, to form
patterns which eventually become the circuitry on the chip. This process is
repeated many times, using different patterns and interconnects between layers
to form the complex, multi-layer circuitry on a semiconductor chip. As device
geometries decrease and wafer sizes increase, it is even more critical that
these photoresists have an accurate thickness and uniformity, as well as low
levels of contamination, for manufacturers to achieve acceptable yields in the
manufacturing process.

   Etch and Resist Strip. Etch is the process of selectively removing precise
areas of thin films that have been deposited on the surface of a wafer. The
hardened photoresist protects the remaining material that makes up the
circuits. During etch, specific areas of the film not covered by photoresist
are removed to leave a desired circuit pattern. Similarly, resist strip is a
process of removing the photoresist material from the wafer after the desired
pattern has been placed on the wafer. Emerging advanced etch and resist strip
applications require precisely controlled gas chemistries and flow rates in
order to achieve precise etch and resist strip characteristics.

   Wet Cleaning. Ultra-high purity chemicals and photoresists of precise
composition are used to clean the wafers, to pattern circuit images and to
remove photoresists after etch. Before processes such as photoresist coating,
thin film deposition, ion implantation, diffusion and oxidation, and after
processes, such as ion implantation and etch, the photoresists must be stripped
off, and the wafer cleaned in multiple steps of chemical processes. To maintain
manufacturing yields and avoid defective products, these chemicals must be
maintained at very high purity levels without the presence of foreign matters
such as particles, ions or organic contaminants.

   Many of the processes used to manufacture semiconductors are also used to
manufacture flat panel displays, magnetic and optical storage devices and fiber
optic cables for telecommunications, resulting in the need for similar
filtration, purification, control and measurement capabilities.

Current Trends in Semiconductor Manufacturing

   In response to increasing competition in the semiconductor industry,
semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers continuously seek to
improve their competitive position through a variety of means, including
technological innovation, cost reduction and improved customer service and
support. These ongoing efforts are driving a number of key trends in the
industry, which impact not only semiconductor and other electronic device
manufacturers, but also their equipment, component and materials suppliers.
These trends include:

  .  Smaller Geometries. To achieve greater speed and functionality and to
     reduce the size of electronic components, semiconductor manufacturers
     are continuing to shrink the size and geometries of semiconductor
     components. This trend requires increasingly tighter manufacturing
     tolerances, a higher

                                       49
<PAGE>

    sensitivity to impurities and the need for greater precision to achieve
    desired yields. In addition, the transition to smaller circuit patterns,
    including the use of .13 microns and smaller line widths, requires new
    and additional manufacturing process steps.

  .  Larger Wafer Size. Semiconductor manufacturers are transitioning from
     200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers in an effort to improve
     productivity and reduce costs. This shift in wafer size requires
     semiconductor manufacturers to retool their existing facilities and
     makes it increasingly important for manufacturers to achieve high levels
     of surface uniformity and flatness. To achieve these objectives, the
     manufacturing process must be cleaner and more precise. At the same
     time, the larger wafer sizes make the process of maintaining constant
     flow and pressure rates for the process liquids, gases and chemicals
     more difficult. As a result, we believe that larger wafer sizes will
     generate increased demand for more precise liquid and gas delivery
     systems, filters and other consumable products.

  .  New Materials and Processes. The transition to smaller circuit patterns
     and feature sizes is also leading to the introduction of new materials,
     such as new types of photoresist chemicals, copper for conductors and a
     new class of organic and inorganic materials for insulators. These
     changes are being accompanied by the development of new liquid processes
     such as chemical mechanical planarization and copper plating that
     require new technologies for the purification, filtration, delivery and
     control of liquids in the process chamber.

  .  Need for Greater Process Control. High capital and operating costs
     associated with the semiconductor manufacturing industry have made it
     critical for manufacturers to collect and use real-time process data to
     permit close analysis and control of all aspects of the semiconductor
     manufacturing process. Manufacturers are seeking production components
     and integrated systems with capabilities for self-monitoring and
     adjusting production tolerances and processes.

  .  Trends Toward Outsourcing Within the Semiconductor Manufacturing Supply
     Chain. Escalating costs of new fabrication facilities and production
     equipment and the increasing focus on time-to-market are driving demand
     for an increased level of outsourcing and consolidation within the
     manufacturing supply chain. Just as semiconductor companies and
     integrated device manufacturers are outsourcing larger portions of their
     manufacturing capabilities to foundries, we believe that semiconductor
     capital equipment companies have also begun to outsource some of their
     manufacturing requirements to semiconductor component, subsystem and
     materials companies, particularly those with global capabilities.
     Outsourcing the design and manufacture of critical components and
     subsystems, such as mass flow controllers, liquid and gas delivery
     systems, vacuum systems, wafer handling robotics and automation
     software, enables these capital equipment companies to better focus on
     their core competencies.

  .  Demand for Global Presence. The semiconductor manufacturing industry
     operates increasingly on a global basis, as manufacturers seek proximity
     to customers and suppliers to lower production costs and to reduce the
     time required to manufacture and distribute commercial products on a
     worldwide basis. As a result, semiconductor capital equipment and
     subsystem suppliers that provide equipment for those manufacturing
     facilities benefit from being able to provide engineering, sales,
     service, spare parts and support on a worldwide basis.

  .  Consolidation Within the Industry. Generally, larger suppliers are
     better able to address the demands of manufacturers due to their broader
     product portfolios, interoperability of product lines, broader
     geographic presence and greater research and development and
     manufacturing capabilities. In addition, larger suppliers often benefit
     from economies of scale by leveraging their infrastructure, distribution
     process and overhead. These competitive advantages are driving
     consolidation among component, subsystem and materials suppliers. By
     streamlining the production process, semiconductor and other electronic
     device manufacturers can more effectively respond to market demands.
     This increased efficiency allows semiconductor and other electronic
     device manufacturers to reduce costs, increase synergies and simplify
     their supply relationships through single-sourcing arrangements.

                                       50
<PAGE>

    As a result, we believe that a select group of global component,
    subsystem and materials companies who can provide comprehensive and cost
    effective next-generation products and support while servicing their
    integrated device manufacturer and foundry customers globally are likely
    to emerge as market leaders over the next several years.

  .  Environmental, Health and Safety Concerns. In an effort to reduce costs
     and production downtime, semiconductor manufacturers are devoting
     increased attention to environmental, health and safety concerns.
     Manufacturers are placing increased emphasis on reducing the amounts and
     toxicity of the chemicals and fluids used in the semiconductor
     manufacturing process, extending the life of process chemicals through
     recycling, purifying and reusing process chemicals and reducing the
     quantity of water used in the manufacturing process.

   As a result of the above trends, we believe that many semiconductor
manufacturers will increasingly rely upon their equipment, component and
materials suppliers to provide products and services on a global basis that
assist in technological innovation, improving manufacturing yields, reducing
costs and improving customer service.

Our Competitive Strengths

   We are a worldwide developer, manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas
delivery systems, components and consumables used to precisely measure,
deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and chemicals, as well
as the deionized water, photoresists and vacuum systems, that are utilized in
the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our products are designed to meet all
of the liquid, gas and chemical delivery, control, dispense and purification
needs of our customers. In turn, semiconductor and other electronic device
manufacturers and equipment companies can outsource the complete design,
manufacture, service and support of their liquid and gas delivery, control,
dispense and purification systems to us. We seek to leverage our longstanding
global customer relationships with semiconductor and other electronic device
manufacturers and equipment companies to develop next generation liquid and
gas delivery system products and consumables. We also seek to support our
customers' product development, applications development and service support
needs on a worldwide basis.

   We believe that our competitive strengths and customer relationships will
allow us to benefit from industry trends. Our competitive strengths include:

   Demonstrated Industry Innovation. We have been providing filtration and
process control products to our customers for over twenty years. Our core
technology capabilities in membrane-based purification and liquid and gas
delivery technology, our modular and networked component and subsystem designs
and our global focus on providing low cost of ownership products to our
customers allow us to maintain broad and technologically advanced product
offerings, which, in turn, enables us to meet the demands of our existing
customers and generate new customer opportunities. We are continuously
developing additional core technologies to add to our product portfolio to
meet the evolving needs of our customers. Recent examples of these new
enabling technologies include dual-stage photochemical dispense systems, high
precision mass flow controllers and pressure and vacuum technologies. We
believe that our demonstrated record of innovation and performance is
evidenced by our new product developments, which have been critical to our
success as a component and subsystem supplier for capital equipment and
semiconductor manufacturers. Such products include our polymeric melt-cast
membranes, which are membranes made from chemical polymers using a melt-cast
process, our ultra-high weight polyethylene membranes, our high flow
efficiency metal membranes for gas filtration and our advances in two-stage
pump technology.

   Technologically Advanced Products for High-Growth Markets. We currently
offer products to address many high-growth market segments, such as copper
plating, advanced photoresist, chemical mechanical planarization and low-k
dielectrics, which are materials with a high resistance to the flow of
electricity. We have continuously enhanced and expanded our product offerings
in response to the evolving needs of our customers. For example, we recently
introduced the IntelliFlow(TM) thermal-based mass flow control product

                                      51
<PAGE>


family, featuring advanced Internet-connected diagnostic capability and
compatibility with the industry standard DeviceNet(TM) communication protocol
to meet our customers' demands for a network-enabled product. Through our
continuous development efforts, we currently have 156 U.S. patents and patent
applications and 325 foreign patents and applications, including counterparts
to U.S. filings. We have developed, and continue to develop, new products to
address emerging industry trends. These trends include the transition from the
use of 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers, the shrinking of
integrated circuit line widths and the use of new classes of materials, such as
copper, titanium nitride and organic and inorganic dielectric materials. Our
products allow us to deliver process fluids with high precision over the
extreme and variable conditions that are critical to the semiconductor
manufacturing process in a manner that is consistent and repeatable.


   Comprehensive Product Offering. We offer a full line of products to meet the
liquid, gas and chemical process control and filtration and purification
requirements of our customers, including a wide range of filters, purification
products, pressure control products, flow control instruments, vacuum control
components and integrated photochemical dispense systems. To meet the
increasingly complex needs of our customers, many of our products incorporate
several components into single integrated solutions, which we believe offer
improved performance at a lower cost than similar subsystems built from
discrete components.

   Advanced Application Development Services. Our engineers work with our key
original equipment manufacturer customers to design and develop product
solutions to meet their unique needs. By participating in the development and
design of our original equipment manufacturer customers' systems, we are often
able to have our components and subsystems specified at the design stage. Such
specifications can result in our components being a preferred source of supply
during the entire system lifecycle. In most cases the products that we develop
for specific customers can be utilized in our standard product offering to
satisfy the needs of our other customers. In addition, we work closely with our
semiconductor device customers to have them specify our components and
subsystems to their equipment suppliers.

   Global Manufacturing, Service and Support. We are geographically positioned
to provide our customers with worldwide product, service and support. We
maintain a global sales and support organization with over 25 offices
worldwide. Likewise, we currently manufacture our products worldwide at six
sites located in the United States, Japan and England. We plan to close two of
these manufacturing facilities in the United States and downsize our operations
in England. We expect to move the eliminated operations to our Allen, Texas
facility and a new facility that we anticipate opening outside the United
States in late 2001 or early 2002. The new facility is expected to replace
manufacturing capacity that we will lose as a result of our exit from the
Jaffrey, New Hampshire facility as part of the separation. We anticipate moving
between 10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations from our existing
domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new facility over the
next two to three years. We continue to devote significant resources to expand
our worldwide manufacturing, service and support capabilities to meet the
global demand for liquid and gas delivery systems, components and consumables.
We have sales and support facilities in key locations in Asia, including our
dedicated sales, research and development and manufacturing organization in
Japan. Most recently, we have added fully-equipped applications laboratories in
the region in order to support the growing need generated by the local
foundries and maintain a strong presence in the region.

   Low Cost of Ownership. Our products enable a low cost of ownership through
features such as modular and flexible design, high reliability, reduced system
complexity and space requirements and ease of replacement. In addition, our
products feature several unique ease-of-use features designed to enhance
uptime, which is the amount of time that the semiconductor processing tool is
available for processing, limit operator exposure to toxic substances,
including as a result of safety accidents caused by accidental release or
spillage of photochemicals, and minimize required space and chemical waste.
Connectology(TM), which is our method of uniting a liquid or gas delivery
apparatus with a filter through a uniquely designed connection, provides all of
these advanced features. In addition, we believe that our integrated product
solutions are easier to install and configure than prior generations of our
products, further reducing the overall cost to the customer. We were also one
of the first industry participants to make our products compatible with
emerging digital network standards, such as the semiconductor industry's
DeviceNet(TM) protocol, which enables components to transmit self-diagnostic
and other information over a digital network.

                                       52
<PAGE>

   Environmentally Conscious Products. Our delivery systems and components
enable our customers to reduce their usage of hazardous chemicals, allow for
more efficient recycling and purification processes than prior generations of
our products and reduce the volume and toxicity of discharged liquids, gases
and chemicals. For example, we are providing products for emerging markets that
offer improved environmental characteristics. These emerging markets include
copper plating, slurry regeneration, where the slurry, which is a liquid
compound that includes abrasives and is used to polish the wafer surface to
remove defects, is cleaned for reuse, and purification and ozone-activated
deionized water cleaning.

Our Business Strategy

   Our objective is to enhance our position as a worldwide developer,
manufacturer and supplier of liquid and gas delivery systems, components and
consumables used by semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers to
precisely measure, deliver, control and purify the process liquids, gases and
chemicals used in their manufacturing processes. Our strategy to achieve this
objective includes the following key elements:

   Extend Technology in High-Growth Markets. We seek to extend our technology
by developing advanced products that address the trends in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry. We have continuously improved our products as our
customers' needs have evolved. For example, we have developed purification
technologies, hollow fiber membranes for liquid and gas contactors, where the
liquids and gases flow through the hollow center of a straw-like tube made of a
porous membrane. Similarly, we have expanded upon our proprietary two-stage
dispense technology with integrated filtration for photoresist delivery, where
the photoresist is filtered through one pump and precisely dispensed through a
second pump at a different flow rate to reduce defects on wafers. We plan to
continue to expand our product lines both through internal development and
through private labeling and acquisitions of complementary businesses, products
and technologies to address new industry trends and requirements.

   Provide Comprehensive and Flexible Product Offerings. The semiconductor
manufacturing industry is driven by rapid technological changes and intense
competition. We believe that semiconductor manufacturers are seeking process
control suppliers who can provide a broad range of reliable, flexible and cost
effective product components and systems, as well as the technological and
application design expertise necessary to deliver effective solutions. Our
comprehensive product offering enables us to meet a broad range of customer
needs and provide a single source of flexible product offerings for
semiconductor device and capital equipment manufacturers as they seek to
consolidate their supplier relationships to a smaller select group. In
addition, we believe that our modular component approach, which provides
compatibility among our different components, facilitates the design and
delivery of systems that specifically address the particular needs of the
customer. Our modular design also eases maintenance, reduces downtime and can
minimize the physical dimensions of our systems.

   Optimize Global Presence. We have established a global infrastructure of
design, manufacturing, distribution, service and support facilities to meet the
needs of our customers. In addition, we may expand our global infrastructure,
either through acquisition or internal development, to accommodate increased
demand or we may consolidate inefficient operations to optimize our
manufacturing and other capabilities. For example, we are establishing a
presence in China through a sales office in anticipation of a growing
semiconductor manufacturing base in that region. We also anticipate opening a
manufacturing facility outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002 and
moving between 10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations from our
existing domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new facility
over the next two to three years. As semiconductor and other electronic device
manufacturers have become increasingly global, they have required that
suppliers offer comprehensive local repair and customer support services. We
maintain our customer relationships through a combination of direct sales and
support personnel and selected independent sales representatives and
distributors in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

   Continue to Develop Strategic Relationships. We have established ongoing key
relationships with many leading original equipment manufacturers and materials
suppliers in our key markets. Our industry relationships have provided us with
the opportunity for significant collaboration with our customers at the product
design stage that has facilitated our ability to introduce new products and
applications that meet our customers' needs.

                                       53
<PAGE>

For example, we work with our key customers at the pre-design and design stage
to identify and respond to their requests for current and future generations of
products. We target opportunities to offer new technologies in emerging
applications, such as copper plating, chemical mechanical planarization, wet-
dry cleaning systems and photolithography. We believe that our large customer
base will continue to be an important source of new product development ideas.
We continually seek to enhance our relationships with our major customers
through collaboration on new product designs and joint research and development
opportunities and to identify opportunities to develop similar relationships
with additional semiconductor capital equipment and device manufacturers.

   Maintain a Diversified Revenue Stream. By attempting to balance our sales of
component and subsystem products with sales of our consumable products, we
target a diversified revenue stream. Our consumable products provide a
relatively more stable and recurring source of revenue in an otherwise cyclical
industry. We believe that as new technologies develop and the complexity of the
semiconductor manufacturing process increases, the resulting need for increased
purity and precision in the manufacturing process will increase demand for
consumable products.

   Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that
enable us to address gaps in our product offerings, secure new customers,
diversify into complementary product markets or broaden our technological
capabilities and product offerings. In January 1997, we successfully completed
the acquisition of Tylan General, Inc., a supplier of components and integrated
systems for gas equipment processes used in the manufacture of semiconductors.
In addition, we are continuously evaluating opportunities for strategic
alliances and joint development efforts with key customers and other industry
leaders. While we have no current commitments with respect to any future
acquisitions, we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities and, subject to
restrictions due to Section 355(e) and Section 368(c) of the Internal Revenue
Code, which may significantly limit our ability to issue shares of our common
stock for acquisitions, we intend to actively pursue acquisitions and
investments in complementary businesses. For a discussion of Section 355(e) and
Section 368(c), please see "Our Separation from Millipore--Tax Limitations on
Additional Issuances of Our Stock."

   Leverage Core Technologies in Related Markets. We plan to leverage our
accumulated expertise in the semiconductor industry by developing products for
applications that employ similar production processes that utilize high purity
fluids, integrated dispense systems and vacuum-based production technologies.
Our products are used in manufacturing processes outside of the semiconductor
industry, including the manufacturing of flat panel displays, high-purity
chemicals, photoresists, solar cells, gas lasers, optical and magnetic storage
devices and fiber optic cables. We plan to continue to identify and develop
products that address advanced materials processing applications where fluid
management plays a critical role. We believe that by utilizing our technology
to provide manufacturing solutions across multiple industries we are able to
increase the total available market for our products and reduce, to an extent,
our exposure to the cyclicality of any particular market.

Our Products and Technology

   Our products include instruments, components, subsystems and consumable
products used in the manufacture of semiconductors and other electronic
devices. Instruments, components and subsystems accounted for 42%, 42%, 50% and
49% of our net sales for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and
the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively, and consumable products
accounted for 58%, 58%, 50% and 51%, respectively, of our net sales in these
same periods. In each of these periods photochemical dispense systems
represented between 15% and 30% of our net sales from instruments, components
and subsystems, gas flow measurement and control products accounted for
approximately 30% of our net sales from instruments, components and subsystems,
and liquid filtration and purification products accounted for more than two-
thirds of our net sales from consumable products. In each of our last three
fiscal years and the three months ended March 31, 2001, our sales of pressure
measurement and control products, vacuum gauges, valves and controllers and our
sales outside of the semiconductor industry have each accounted for less than
10% of our net sales in such periods. Our two product classes include the
following specific product types:

Photochemical Dispense Systems

   Based upon our proprietary integrated, high precision photochemical
filtration and dispense systems that utilize patented two-stage technology, we
believe that we are the only supplier to the microelectronics industry with
integrated filtration and dispense technology. Our proprietary technology also
includes our Connectology(TM) technology, low hold-up volume disposable
filters, hollow fiber membrane technology and patented digital valve control
technology. Two-stage technology, as opposed to conventional single-stage
technology, allows for filtering and dispensing of photochemicals at different
rates, reducing defects on wafters. Connectology(TM) technology allows for
filter changes in less than two minutes, faster than our conventional filters
and with less potential exposure to hazardous chemicals. Low hold-up volume
disposable filters reduce the amount of expensive chemicals lost each time a
filter is changed. Hollow fiber membrane technology allows the process liquids
and gases to flow through the hollow center of a straw-like tube made of a
porous membrane material. Digital valve control technology improves chemical
uniformity on wafers and improves ease of operation in the fabrication plant.
In addition, high precision liquid dispense systems based on our proprietary
patented technology enable uniform application of photoresists for the spin-
coating process where uniformity is measured in units of Angstroms, a fraction
of the thickness of a human hair.

Gas Flow Measurement and Control Products

   We offer a complete product family of digital and analog mass flow
controllers to meet the stringent requirements of semiconductor processing.
Mass flow controllers are devices that automatically and precisely measure and
control the flow rates of multiple liquids and gases into the process chamber
in order to maintain circuit quality, reduce maintenance requirements and
prolong the life of the equipment used in the manufacturing process. We have
also developed pressure-based mass flow controllers, which measure and control
the liquids and gases by controlling the pressure applied to these fluids. Our
IntelliFlow(TM) product platform combines our gas measurement and control
products with the DeviceNet(TM) communications protocol to provide a digital
solution to achieve advanced process control and network communications. The
embedded diagnostics software provides real time feedback and allows users to
make on-tool adjustments to critical process parameters, thereby preventing
costly down time.

Pressure Measurement and Control Products

   We offer a wide variety of pressure measurement and control products to meet
the needs of our customers, including pressure gauges, transducers, displays
and scales. These products offer high rates of accuracy, reliability,
repeatability and purity. Transducers measure the pressure applied to the wafer
and the fluids during the manufacturing process. Our displays range from local
readout displays at the point-of-use to real-time displays at the point-of-
source. Our scales are used to provide real-time volume measurement.

Vacuum Gauges, Valves and Controllers

   We offer a wide range of vacuum instruments consisting of vacuum measurement
sensors and associated power supplies and display units. Our vacuum valves are
used between the process chamber and the pump that delivers the gas to the
process chamber and can withstand temperatures of 150 degrees Celsius. These
vacuum gauges directly measure the level of pressure in the process chamber and
between the process chamber and a pump. These gauges can measure pressures as
low as 0.1 Torr, which is a fraction of the Earth's atmospheric pressure. We
also manufacture a range of vacuum controllers that take the signals from the
vacuum gauges and provide the necessary control signals to the vacuum valves in
order to maintain precise processing parameters.

Consumables Product Class

Liquid Filtration and Purification Products

   Liquid processing includes such steps as photolithography, deposition,
planarization and surface etching and cleaning. The fluids that are used
include various mixtures of acids, bases, solvents, slurries and
photochemicals, which in turn are used over a broad range of operating
conditions, including temperatures from 5 degrees Celsius up to 180 degrees
Celsius. Specially designed proprietary filters remove sub-micron sized
particles and bubbles from the different fluid streams that are used in the
manufacturing process. Some of our filters are constructed with ultra-high
molecular weight polyethylene hollow fiber membranes that offer improved bubble
clearance and gel removal, either of which can cause defects in the wafers if
not removed. These filters also utilize patented ConnectologyTM technology to
provide for rapid filter changes, minimal equipment downtime and limited
operator exposure to toxic chemicals.

Gas Filtration and Purification Products

   Our Wafergard(TM), ChamberGard(TM) and Waferpure(TM) particle and molecular
filtration products provide for the distribution of gas in the process chamber
in order to eliminate system and wafer problems due to particulate, atmospheric
and chemical contaminants. These filters are able to retain all particles 0.003
microns and larger. Our metal filters, such as stainless steel and nickel
filters, reduce outgassing and improve corrosion resistance. Our Waferpure(TM)
purifiers chemically react with and absorb volatile contaminants, such as
oxygen and water, to prevent contamination and our ChamberGard(TM) vent
diffusers reduce particle contamination and processing cycle times.

Worldwide Applications Development and Field Support Capabilities

   We provide strong technical support to our customers through local service
groups and engineers consisting of field applications engineers, technical
service groups, applications development groups and

                                       57
<PAGE>

training departments. Our applications development groups maintain process
equipment that emulate customers' applications and industry test standards and
our applications laboratories provide product evaluation, customer technical
support and complaint resolution. Our service centers are responsible for
calibration, repairs and servicing of our products. Our applications
development groups, located in Bedford, Massachusetts, Allen, Texas and Tokyo,
Japan, are primarily responsible for supporting new products and applications
development, industry collaboration and providing additional technical
expertise to our customers. Our field applications engineers, located on the
east and west coasts of the United States and in seven other countries, work
directly with our customers on product qualification and process improvement in
their facilities. In addition, in response to customer needs for local
technical service and fast turn-around time, we maintain four regional
applications laboratories located in Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and France and
eight service centers located in California, Texas, Arizona, Germany, the
United Kingdom, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.

Customers

   Our major customer groups include integrated circuit manufacturers, original
equipment manufacturers that provide equipment to integrated circuit
manufacturers, and gas and chemical manufacturing companies. Our most
significant customers based on sales in 2000 include industry leaders, such as
Applied Materials, Inc., ASM Lithography Holding N.V., Dainippon Screen
Manufacturing Co., Ltd., FSI International, Inc., LAM Research Corporation,
Novellus Systems, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. Ltd. and Tokyo Electron Limited.

   We also sell our products to flat panel display original equipment
manufacturers, materials suppliers and end-users. The major manufacturers for
flat panel displays and flat panel display equipment are concentrated in Japan,
Korea and other parts of Asia.

   We may enter into supply agreements with our customers to govern the conduct
of business between us and our customers, including the manufacture of our
products. These agreements generally have a term of one to three years but
these agreements do not contain any long-term purchase orders or commitments.
Instead, we work closely with our customers to develop non-binding forecasts of
the future volume of orders. However, customers may cancel their orders, change
production quantities from forecasted volumes or delay production for a number
of reasons beyond our control.

   In 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, sales to
our top ten customers accounted for approximately 29%, 31%, 39% and 38%,
respectively, of our net sales. During those same periods, Tokyo Electron
Limited accounted for approximately 11%, 13% and 18% and 17%, respectively, of
our net sales and international sales represented approximately 57%, 61%, 61%
and 64%, respectively, of our net sales.

   Over 2,500 customers purchased products from us during 2000.

Sales and Marketing

   We sell our products worldwide primarily through our own direct sales force
located in over 25 offices in major industrialized and developed countries, as
well as through independent distributors in other parts of the world. As of
March 31, 2001, our sales and marketing force consisted of approximately 260
employees worldwide. Our direct sales force is supplemented by independent
sales representatives and agents.

   Our marketing efforts focus on our "push/pull" marketing strategy in order
to maximize our selling opportunities. We work with original equipment
manufacturers to design tools that require our products and we create end user
"pull" demand where the products are specified by the semiconductor
manufacturers. Our industry relationships have provided us with the opportunity
for significant collaboration with our customers at the product design stage
that has facilitated our ability to introduce new products and applications
that meet our customers' needs. In addition, we are constantly identifying for
our customers the variety of analytical, purification and process control
challenges which may be addressed by our products. Further, we adapt our
products and technologies to process control issues identified by our
customers. Our sales representatives provide our customers with worldwide
support and information on our products.

                                       58
<PAGE>

   We believe that our technical support services are important to our
marketing efforts. These services include assisting in defining a customer's
needs, evaluating alternative products, designing a specific system to perform
the desired separation, training users and assisting customers in compliance
with relevant government regulations. In addition, we maintain a network of
service centers located in the United States and in key international markets
to support our products.

Manufacturing

   We believe that our ability to manufacture reliable products in a cost-
effective manner is critical to meeting the demanding requirements of our
customers. Our principal manufacturing activities consist of precision
assembly, test, calibration, welding, machining and electro-polishing
activities, as well as the manufacture of membranes and consumable filter
devices. We subcontract a portion of our assembly, machining and printed
circuit board assembly and testing. We perform all other assembly, test and
calibration functions, including critical assembly activities, which are
performed in clean room environments, at our facilities. We monitor and analyze
product lead times, warranty data, process yields, supplier performance, field
data on mean time between failures, inventory turns, repair response time and
other indicators so that we can continuously improve our manufacturing
processes.

   We expect to continue to devote significant financial and management
resources to optimize our worldwide production and service capabilities. Due to
the short time between the receipt of orders and shipments, we normally operate
with an insignificant level of backlog. In addition, we work closely with our
customers to forecast demand in order to better anticipate our production
requirements.

   We currently have an aggregate of approximately 140,000 square feet of
manufacturing capacity in three locations in the United States, and we have an
aggregate of approximately 90,000 square feet in Japan and 10,000 square feet
in England. We also manufacture our products in Millipore's Bedford,
Massachusetts facility pursuant to the terms of our master transitional
services agreement with Millipore. Our significant manufacturing facilities in
the United States are either ISO 9001 or ISO 9002 registered, and our facility
in Yonezawa, Japan is ISO 14000 registered. In addition, we are implementing a
low-cost sourcing strategy to supplement our in-house manufacturing
capabilities for specific product lines. We are in the process of relocating
the operations of our manufacturing facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts and
Jaffrey, New Hampshire and downsizing our manufacturing facility in Swindon,
England as part of our worldwide manufacturing rationalization plan. We expect
that the manufacturing operations eliminated from these facilities will be
moved to our Allen, Texas facility and to a new facility that we anticipate
opening outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002. The new facility
is expected to replace manufacturing capacity that we will lose as a result of
our exit from the Jaffrey, New Hampshire facility as part of the separation. We
anticipate moving between 10% and 20% of our overall manufacturing operations
from our existing domestic and foreign manufacturing facilities to this new
facility over the next two to three years.

   We have made significant investments in developing a worldwide manufacturing
infrastructure of both equipment and people. In many cases, we have also
sourced parts from local vendors to increase flexibility and responsiveness.
Through this expansion we have focused on improving work flow through the
manufacturing process and operator training programs, and are continually
monitoring our operations for cost reduction opportunities to ensure that we
continue to supply cost effective quality products to our customers.

Competition

   The market for our products is highly competitive. While price is an
important factor, we compete primarily on the basis of the following factors:

  .  historical customer relationships;

  .  technical expertise;

  .  product quality and performance;

  .  total cost of ownership;

                                       59
<PAGE>

  .  customer service and support;

  .  breadth of product line;

  .  breadth of geographic presence;

  .  manufacturing capabilities; and

  .  after-sales service.

   We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of the factors
listed above, but we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so. We
believe that our key competitive strengths include our broad product line, the
low total cost of ownership of our products, our ability to provide our
consumables customers with quick order fulfillment and our technical expertise.
However, our competitive position varies depending on the market segment and
specific product areas within these segments. For example, in the market for
photochemical dispense systems, we believe that our patented technology, our
longstanding relationships with leading original equipment manufacturers in
this market niche and our ability to support our customers' needs on a global
basis have allowed us to compete favorably. In contrast, other companies have
more established positions in the markets related to gas delivery systems and
components, such as gas flow measurement and control products, pressure
measurement and control products and vacuum gauges, valves and controllers.
While we have longstanding relationships with a number of semiconductor and
other electronic device manufacturers, we also face significant competition
from companies that have longstanding relationships with other semiconductor
and electronic device manufacturers and, as a result, have been able to have
their products specified by those customers for use in manufacturers'
fabrication facilities. In addition, some of our competitors have cost
advantages over us in the markets for gas delivery systems and components due
to their larger market share and the related economies of scale. In the markets
for our consumable products, we believe that our differentiated membrane
technology, strong supply chain capabilities, which allow us to provide our
customers with quick order fulfillment, and technical expertise, which enables
us to develop membranes to meet specific customer needs and assist our
customers in improving the functionality of our membranes for particular
applications, allow us to compete favorably. In these markets our competitors
compete against us on the basis of price, as well as alternative membrane
technology having different functionality, manufacturing capabilities and
breadth of geographic presence.

   The market for our products is highly fragmented, and we compete with a
number of different companies, including Iwaki Co., Ltd., MKS Instruments,
Inc., Mott Metallurgical Corporation and Pall Corporation. Some of our
competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In some cases,
our competitors are smaller than us, but well-established in specific product
niches. However, we believe that none of our competitors competes with us
across all of our product offerings and that, within the markets that we serve,
we offer a broader line of products, make use of a wider range of process
control technologies and address a broader range of applications than any
single competitor. Nonetheless, competitors with greater financial resources
may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or other
incentives that we cannot match or offer. These competitors may be in a
stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies, devote more resources
to developing new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive
marketing campaigns. They also may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and
make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic
partners.

   Semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers may direct
semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier's
product in their equipment. Accordingly, our success depends in part on our
ability to have semiconductor and other electronic device manufacturers specify
that our products be used at their fabrication facilities. Some of our
competitors may have more developed relationships with semiconductor and other
electronic device manufacturers, which enables them to have their products
specified for use in manufacturers' fabrication facilities.

   In addition, following our separation from Millipore, except as specifically
prohibited in our separation agreements with Millipore with respect to the use
of existing intellectual property and technological expertise,

                                       60
<PAGE>

we may compete against Millipore and Millipore may compete against us. In
particular, Millipore may choose to reestablish a microelectronics business
unit, or work with a third party to establish a competitive capability.

Research and Development

   Our aggregate research and development expenses in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and
the three months ended March 31, 2001 were $21.5 million, $19.3 million, $23.2
million and $5.9 million, respectively. As of March 31, 2001, we had
approximately 150 employees in engineering, research and development. In
addition, we have followed a practice of supplementing our internal research
and development efforts by licensing technology from unaffiliated third parties
and/or acquiring distribution rights with respect thereto when we believe it is
in our long-term interests to do so.

   To meet the global needs of our customers, we have research and development
capabilities in the United States and Japan. Our research and development
efforts are directed toward developing and improving our technology platforms
for semiconductor and advanced processing applications and identifying and
developing products for new applications for which fluid management plays a
critical role. Recently, our efforts have been particularly focused on the
development of new materials and technology associated with key industry
trends, such as the transition from the use of 200 millimeter wafers to 300
millimeter wafers, the shrinking of integrated circuit line-widths and the use
of new classes of materials, such as copper, titanium nitride and organic and
inorganic dielectric materials. We have undertaken an initiative to involve our
marketing, engineering, manufacturing and sales personnel in the development of
new products in order to reduce the time to market for new products. Our
employees also work closely with our customers' development personnel. These
relationships help us identify and define future technical needs on which to
focus our research and development efforts. In addition, we participate in
Semiconductor Industry Suppliers Association, a consortium of semiconductor
equipment suppliers. We also support research at academic and other
institutions targeted at advances in materials science and semiconductor
process development.

   On the effective date of our separation from Millipore, key membrane
researchers and engineers were transferred to us. In addition, we entered into
a five-year contractual research agreement with Millipore to minimize the
interruption of our long-term research projects and transfer to us full
ownership of specified related intellectual property rights.

Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights

   We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret
laws and license agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We
have 92 U.S. issued and enforceable patents, 106 issued and enforceable foreign
patents, including counterparts to U.S. filings, 64 pending U.S. patent
applications, 23 pending filings under the Patent Cooperation Treaty not yet
nationalized and 196 pending foreign patent applications. While we believe that
patents may be important for aspects of our business, such as our patents
related to photoresist dispense pumps, polymer membranes, gas filters, mass
flow controllers and our Connectology(TM) products, which patents expire
between 2003 and 2018, we believe that our success depends more upon close
customer contact, innovation, technological expertise, responsiveness and
worldwide distribution. Additionally, while our patented technology may delay
or deter a competitor in offering a competing product, we do not believe that
our patent portfolio functions as a barrier to entry for any of our
competitors. In addition, while we license and will continue to license
technology used in the manufacture and distribution of products from third
parties, except as described in the separation agreements with Millipore, these
licenses are not currently related to any of our core product technology.


   We require each of our employees, including our executive officers, to enter
into standard agreements pursuant to which the employee agrees to keep
confidential all of our proprietary information and to assign to us all
inventions made while employed by us.

   A number of our patented products were specifically developed in response to
the transition from 200 millimeter wafers to 300 millimeter wafers, and many of
our new products are specifically targeted to meet the

                                       61
<PAGE>

more stringent requirements for the advanced technologies dominating 300
millimeter wafer manufacturing processes. Examples include our Solaris(TM)
chemical mechanical planarization filters for copper slurries, IntelliGen(TM)
photoresist dispense with digital valves targeted for photolithography
applications and our Intelliflow(TM) mass flow controllers for 300 millimeter
tool automation.

   In connection with our separation from Millipore, we were assigned patents
and trademarks which relate exclusively to our business. Patented technology
that is used by both Millipore and us was generally retained by Millipore and
licensed to us with exclusive rights in our fields of use that are generally
defined by the current operating scope of our business. In some cases, the
technology was transferred to us, and we granted Millipore an exclusive license
in its fields of use in the biopharmaceutical and related industries. These
licenses are assignable by the licensee only in connection with a sale of its
business, do not require the payment of any license fees or royalties by either
Millipore or us and will continue in effect for the life of the patents. In
addition, in order to assure future access to patented technology not licensed
as part of the separation, the separation agreements provide each of us with a
technology license option. The option grants each party a five-year option to
acquire a royalty bearing license to patented technology existing as of the
separation date that is owned by the other party and is not currently used by
the optionee but may be useful for future products, with exclusive rights in
its fields of use. The license term would extend for the life of the subject
patents.

Governmental Regulation

   Our operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory
requirements relating to environmental, waste management and health and safety
matters, including measures relating to the release, use, storage, treatment,
transportation, discharge, disposal and remediation of contaminants, hazardous
substances and wastes, as well as practices and procedures applicable to the
construction and operation of our plants. There can be no assurance that we
will not incur material costs and liabilities or that our past or future
operations will not result in exposure to injury or claims of injury by
employees or the public. Although some risk of costs and liabilities related to
these matters is inherent in our business, as with many similar businesses, we
believe that our business is operated in substantial compliance with applicable
regulations. However, new, modified or more stringent requirements or
enforcement policies could be adopted, which could adversely affect us. We are
not presently aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause us to incur
significant costs or liabilities in the future related to environmental, health
and safety law compliance.

Legal Proceedings

   In July 2000, we were sued in the Osaka District Court, Osaka, Japan, by
Kurabo Industries Ltd. This suit alleges that a type of filter cartridge
manufactured in Japan by our subsidiary, Nihon Mykrolis KK, infringes a
Japanese patent held by Kurabo. The suit seeks $11 million in damages and an
injunction against our future use of these filter cartridges. Nihon Mykrolis KK
has responded to this suit by denying any infringement. We intend to vigorously
defend this suit but there can be no assurances that we will prevail. We
believe, however, that the litigation described above will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

   We are also party to other lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We
do not believe that these proceedings individually or in the aggregate will
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

Employees

   As of March 31, 2001, without giving effect to our restructuring, we had
approximately 1,000 full-time employees who, prior to the separation date, were
employed by Millipore's microelectronics division, including approximately 150
in engineering, research and development and approximately 260 in sales and
marketing. Given the variability in our business and the quick response time
required by our customers, it is critical that we be able to quickly adjust the
size of our production staff to maximize efficiency. Therefore, we use skilled

                                       62
<PAGE>

temporary labor as required. Prior to our separation from Millipore, all
necessary corporate functions were provided to us by Millipore, and the
associated costs were allocated to us in the form of an allocation of the
expense. This allocation is included in our historical financial results.
Following our separation from Millipore, we have hired approximately 70
personnel and anticipate hiring approximately 25 additional personnel to
facilitate our operation as an independent company and in replacement of
services formerly provided by Millipore's central functions.

   None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a
collective bargaining agreement other than statutorily mandated programs in
European countries.

Facilities

   Our principal executive offices are located in Bedford, Massachusetts. We
also have manufacturing and design facilities in the United States, Japan and
England. Information about these facilities is set forth below:

   sublease agreement expiring in November 2005. The sublessee pays us rent in
   an amount equal to the amount owed by us to our landlord for the subleased
   space.
/2/Pursuant to our worldwide manufacturing rationalization plan, we are in the
   process of relocating our operations from this facility to our Allen, Texas
   facility or a new facility that we anticipate opening outside the United
   States in late 2001 or early 2002. However, there can be no assurance that
   we will be able to identify an acceptable location outside the United States
   for this new facility or enter into any agreements for such a facility on
   favorable terms or at all.
/3/Pursuant to the terms of our master transitional services agreements with
   Millipore, we are currently sharing space with Millipore in this
   manufacturing facility that is owned by Millipore.
/4/Excludes an additional 69,000 square feet that are leased to Millipore.
   Millipore pays us rent for the leased space sufficient to cover our costs
   associated with the space.
/5/Pursuant to our worldwide manufacturing rationalization plan, we are in the
   process of downsizing this facility and moving the eliminated operations to
   our Allen, Texas facility or a new facility that we anticipate opening
   outside the United States in late 2001 or early 2002. However, there can be
   no assurance that we will be able to identify an acceptable location outside
   the United States for this new facility or enter into any agreements for
   such facility on favorable terms or at all.

   In addition, we manufacture our products in Millipore's Bedford,
Massachusetts facility pursuant to the terms of our master transitional
services agreement with Millipore. We maintain a worldwide network of sales and
service centers, including three in the United States, five in Europe (two in
Germany, one in France and two in the United Kingdom), three in Japan and three
in other parts of Asia (Taiwan, Singapore and Korea). Leases for our facilities
expire between August 2000 and March 2008. We currently expect to be able to
extend the terms of expiring leases or to find suitable replacement facilities
on reasonable terms. We also have an option to purchase our Bedford,
Massachusetts headquarters facility at fair market value between June 2005 and
November 2005, the expiration date on our lease, and our landlord has an option
to sell us that Bedford, Massachusetts facility at 90% of its fair market value
prior to November 30, 2005. If our landlord exercises the option to sell, we
have one year to complete the purchase of the facility, during which time
interest on the purchase price will accrue. We currently expect to begin
renovations on our Bedford, Massachusetts headquarters facility in 2001. We
believe that our facilities are well-maintained and, except as described above,
suitable for their respective operations. We anticipate that as our business
grows we will need to obtain additional facilities through acquisitions, leases
or new construction. We may encounter unforeseen difficulties, costs or delays
in expanding our facilities.

   We anticipate that two additional directors who are not affiliated with us
or Millipore will be elected to the board of directors following completion of
this offering.

   C. William Zadel has been our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since
November 2000 and one of our directors since February 2001. Mr. Zadel has been

   At present, all directors are elected and serve until a successor is duly

are no family relationships between any of our directors or executive officers.
Our executive officers are elected by, and serve at the discretion of, the
board of directors.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation requires a minimum of three
directors, and we currently have four directors serving. Our board is divided
into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with each director
serving a three-year term and one class being elected at each year's annual
meeting of stockholders. Our board of directors will consist of a Class II
director (Mr. Pyle), whose term of office will continue until the 2002 annual
meeting of our stockholders, Class III directors (Messrs. Bradley and Zadel),
whose term of office will continue until the 2003 annual meeting of our
stockholders and a Class I director (Mr. Caldwell), who was elected in 2001 and
whose term of office will continue until the 2004 annual meeting of our
stockholders. At each annual meeting of our stockholders, successors to the
class of directors whose term expires at such meeting will be elected to serve
for three-year terms or until their respective successors are elected and
qualified.

Director Compensation

   Directors are reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with such services. Messrs. Bradley, Caldwell and Pyle each receive
an annual retainer of $21,000 plus $1,000 for each board or committee meeting
attended. In addition, any non-employee director who serves as chairman of any
committee of the board will receive an annual retainer of $3,500. Directors are
also eligible to receive awards under our stock option plans.

Committees of the Board of Directors

   Our board of directors has an audit committee and a compensation committee.
The board may also establish other committees to assist in the discharge of its
responsibilities.

   The audit committee makes recommendations to the board of directors
regarding the independent auditors to be nominated for election by the
stockholders and reviews the independence of such auditors, approves the scope
of the annual audit activities of the independent auditors, approves the audit
fee payable to the independent auditors and reviews such audit results with the
independent auditors. The audit committee is currently composed of Messrs.
Bradley, Caldwell and Pyle and, following this offering, will continue to be
composed of three directors who are not otherwise affiliated with us or our
principal stockholder. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP serves as our independent
auditor.

   The duties of the compensation committee are to provide a general review of
our compensation and benefit plans to ensure that they meet corporate
objectives. In addition, the compensation committee reviews the chief executive
officer's recommendations on compensation of all of our officers and adopting
and changing major compensation policies and practices. The compensation
committee reports its recommendations to the whole board of directors for
approval and authorization. It also fixes, subject to approval by the full
board, the annual compensation of the chief executive officer and administers
our stock plans. The compensation committee is currently composed of Messrs.
Bradley, Caldwell and Pyle, none of whom have "interlocking" or other
relationships with us that would detract from their independence as committee
members, and, following this offering, will continue to be composed solely of
three or more non-employee directors (as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934).

Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers

   All of our common stock is currently owned by Millipore, and thus none of
our directors or officers own any of our common stock. To the extent our
directors and officers own shares of Millipore common stock or options to
purchase such shares at the time of the distribution, they will participate in
the distribution on the same terms as other holders of Millipore common stock,
and their unvested options will be converted into options to purchase shares of
our common stock as more fully described below under "--Treatment of Millipore
Options."

   The following table sets forth the number of shares of Millipore common
stock beneficially owned on March 2, 2001 by each director, each of the
executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in the "--
Compensation of Executive Officers" section below, and all of our directors and
executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise indicated below, each entity or
person listed below maintains a mailing address of c/o Mykrolis Corporation,
One Patriots Park, Bedford, Massachusetts 01730.

   Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment
power with respect to securities. Shares of common stock issuable pursuant to
options, to the extent those options are currently exercisable or convertible
within 60 days of March 2, 2001, are treated as outstanding for computing the
percentage of the person holding those securities but are not treated as
outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person. Unless otherwise
noted, to our knowledge each person or group identified possesses sole voting
and investment power with respect to the shares, subject to applicable
community property laws. Beneficial ownership percentage is based on 46,648,127
shares of common stock outstanding as of March 2, 2001.

(1) All of these options are subject to the terms of the applicable Millipore
    stock option plan and are exercisable only as they vest. The options
    granted to each executive officer vest and become exercisable in equal
    annual increments over a four-year period provided the optionee continues
    to be employed by us. It is expected that these options, to the extent they
    remain unvested as of the distribution, will be converted into options to
    purchase shares of our common stock as described below under "--Treatment
    of Millipore Options."
(2) Percentage is based on a total of 1,463,182 shares granted to all Millipore
    employees in fiscal 2000.
(3) All options were granted at an exercise price equal to the fair market
    value of Millipore's common stock on the date of grant.
(4) The amounts shown on this table represent hypothetical gains that could be
    achieved for the respective options if exercised at the end of the option
    term. These gains are based on assumed rates of stock appreciation of 5%
    and 10% compounded annually from the date the respective options were
    granted to their expiration date. The gains shown are net of the option
    exercise price, but do not include deductions for taxes or other expenses
    associated with the exercise. Actual gains, if any, on stock option
    exercises will depend on the future performance of our common stock, the
    optionholder's continued employment through the option period and the date
    on which the options are exercised.

Treatment of Millipore Options

   We intend to assume substantially all of the unvested Millipore options held
by our directors, officers and employees on the distribution date. All vested
Millipore options held by our employees will remain subject to the terms of the
applicable Millipore option plan and will not convert into options to purchase
shares of our common stock. As of March 31, 2001, our employees held unvested
options to purchase 807,353 shares of Millipore common stock at a weighted
average exercise price per share of $40.62. The closing price of Millipore
common stock on March 30, 2001 was $46.26. These assumed options are expected
to convert at the distribution into options to purchase our common stock
pursuant to the employee matters agreement. As part of the conversion, we will
multiply the number of shares purchasable under each converted stock option by
a ratio determined at the time of the conversion and divide the exercise price
per share of each option by the same ratio. The conversion ratio will be the
closing price of Millipore common stock on the last trading day before the
distribution, divided by the opening price of our common stock on the first
trading day after the distribution. The actual number of shares of our common
stock subject to substituted awards will be determined at the time of the
conversion. Based on the 807,353 Millipore stock options held by our employees
on March 31, 2001, the following number of shares of our common stock would be
subject to substituted awards after the conversion with the following weighted
average exercise price per share, assuming the prices for Mykrolis and
Millipore common stock shown below:

</TABLE>


   The number of shares of our common stock subject to substituted awards may
vary significantly from the above numbers due to changes in the relative values
of our common stock and Millipore common stock. Fractional shares will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares. Generally, all other terms
of the converted stock options, such as vesting schedules and exercise periods,
will remain the same as those in effect immediately prior to the conversion.

   In addition, we anticipate granting additional options to purchase shares of
our common stock to our employees prior to this offering. We anticipate that
these options will vest in equal annual increments over a three-year period.

Treatment of Millipore Restricted Stock

   Under the Millipore restricted stock plan, some of our key employees were
granted restricted stock awards. As of March 31, 2001, our employees held
31,182 unvested Millipore restricted shares. The unvested Millipore restricted
shares held by our employees are expected to become fully vested on or before
the distribution. The acceleration of the vesting period may result in an
additional compensation charge in the period of the acceleration based on the
then current market value of Millipore's common stock. If the vesting period
had been accelerated on June 30, 2001, the compensation charge would have been
approximately $1.2 million, based on a Millipore stock price of $61.98.

Stock Plans

2001 Equity Incentive Plan

   The 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2001 Plan, has been adopted by our
board of directors and approved by our stockholder. As of the date of this
prospectus, no awards have been made under the 2001 Plan.

                                       70
<PAGE>

   The 2001 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to our
employees (including officers and employee directors) and for the grant of non-
statutory stock options to our employees, directors and consultants. The number
of shares to be reserved for issuance under the 2001 Plan includes: (1)
6,000,000 shares of common stock, (2) any shares returned to the 2001 Plan as a
result of termination of options and (3) annual increases to be added on the
date of each annual meeting of our stockholders, commencing with the 2002
annual meeting, equal to 1.0% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on
that date or such lesser amount as may be determined by our board of directors.

   Our board of directors, or a committee appointed by our board of directors,
will administer our 2001 Plan and will have the power to determine the terms of
each option granted, including the exercise price of the option, the time at
which each option will vest, the number of shares subject to each option, the
exercisability thereof and the form of consideration payable upon such
exercise. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to amend,
suspend or terminate the 2001 Plan, provided that no such action may affect any
share of common stock previously issued and sold or any option previously
granted under the 2001 Plan.

   Options granted under the 2001 Plan are generally not transferable by the
optionee, and each option is exercisable during the lifetime of the optionee.
Options granted under the 2001 Plan must generally be exercised within three
months after the end of an optionee's status as our employee, director or
consultant, or within 12 months after that optionee's death, but in no event
later than the expiration of the option term.

   The exercise price of all incentive stock options granted under the 2001
Plan must be at least equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the
date of grant. The exercise price of non-statutory stock options granted under
the 2001 Plan is determined by the administrator, but with respect to non-
statutory stock options intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation"
within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the exercise
price must be at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on
the date of grant. With respect to any participant who owns stock representing
more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our
outstanding capital stock, the exercise price of any incentive stock option
grant must be at least equal to 110% of the fair market value on the grant
date, and the term of such incentive stock option must not exceed five years.
The term of all other incentive stock options granted under the 2001 Plan may
not exceed ten years.

   The 2001 Plan provides that in the event we merge with or into another
corporation or sell substantially all of our assets, each option may be
assumed, or an equivalent option substituted for, by the successor corporation.
If the outstanding options are not assumed, or substituted for, by the
successor corporation, all outstanding options shall vest and become
exercisable immediately prior to such a transaction and, unless otherwise
determined by the administrator, shall represent the right to receive the
consideration to be paid in such transaction for each share of our common
stock, less the applicable exercise price. All of these options will terminate
upon the consummation of a merger or sale of assets unless assumed by an
acquiring or surviving entity.

2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan

   The 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, or the director option
plan, has been adopted by our board of directors and approved by our
stockholder. The director option plan was established to encourage stock
ownership by our directors and to provide those individuals with an additional
incentive to manage Mykrolis in the shareholders' best interests. The director
option plan was also established to provide a form of compensation that will
attract and retain highly qualified individuals as members of our board. An
aggregate of 250,000 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under
the director option plan. The director option plan provides for the granting of
options to non-employee directors, as defined therein. The compensation
committee or the full board is authorized under the director option plan to
make discretionary grants of options and determine the terms and conditions of
such options. In addition, the director option plan provides for an initial
one-time grant of options to purchase 2,500 shares of our common stock to each
non-employee director who has not previously received an initial grant of
options and who is serving as a member of our board upon adoption and approval
of the director option plan or to any new non-employee director upon

                                       71
<PAGE>

being elected to our board. The director option plan also provides for annual
option grants upon each anniversary of such director's election, which awards
will be granted at our next annual meeting of stockholders following such
anniversary. The director option plan requires that the exercise price of each
option granted under the plan must equal 100% of the fair market value of our
common stock on the date the option is granted. The initial one-time grants and
the annual grants will vest in three equal installments commencing on the first
anniversary of the grant date. Nothing contained in the director option plan or
any agreement to be executed pursuant to the director option plan will obligate
Mykrolis, our board of directors or our stockholders to retain an optionee as a
director of Mykrolis.

2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

   The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the stock purchase plan, has been
adopted by our board of directors and approved by our stockholder. The stock
purchase plan was established to give eligible employees the opportunity to use
voluntary, systematic payroll deductions, up to 10% of each eligible employee's
cash compensation, to purchase shares of our common stock at a discounted
price. We believe that ownership of stock by our employees will foster greater
employee interest in our success, growth and development.

   Subject to restrictions, each of our employees is eligible to participate in
the stock purchase plan if he or she has been employed by us for more than five
months and is employed for more than 20 hours per week. An employee who owns or
is deemed to own shares of stock representing 5% or more of the combined voting
power or value of all classes of our stock will not be eligible to participate
in the stock purchase plan. We have reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock
for issuance in connection with the stock purchase plan. Elections to
participate will be made on a semi-annual basis. Each participating employee
contributes to the stock purchase plan by choosing a payroll deduction in any
specified amount from 1% up to a maximum of 10% of his or her cash
compensation. Participating employees may increase or decrease the amount of
their payroll deduction semi-annually, beginning with the commencement of the
first offering period. A participating employee may withdraw from the stock
purchase plan upon written notice. As a general matter, elected contributions
will be credited to participants' accounts semi-annually, beginning June 30,
2002; prior to that there will be a transitional election period commencing on
the first day of the month following the completion of this offering and ending
on the last day of the month in which the distribution of our stock is made by
Millipore. Every year, each eligible employee will be permitted to purchase
shares of our common stock with a maximum fair market value of $25,000.

   Set forth below is a summary of how the stock purchase plan will operate:

  .   Each participating employee's contributions will be used to purchase
      shares for the employee's share account after the last day of each
      semi-annual period and such participating employee will receive a
      certificate evidencing such shares.

  .   The cost per share is 85% of the lower of the closing price of our
      common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the first or the last
      day of the semi-annual period.

  .   The number of shares purchased on each employee's behalf and deposited
      in his/her share account is based on the amount accumulated in that
      participant's cash account and the purchase price for shares with
      respect to any semi-annual period.

  .   Shares purchased under the stock purchase plan carry full rights to
      receive dividends declared from time to time.

  .   Share distributions and share splits will be credited to the
      participating employee's share account as of the record date and
      effective date, respectively.

   Subject to applicable federal securities and tax laws, our board of
directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the stock purchase plan.
Amendments to the stock purchase plan will not affect a participating
employee's right to the benefit of contributions made prior to the date of any
such amendment. In the event our stock purchase plan is terminated, our board
of directors may immediately cancel the stock purchase plan and distribute all
amounts held in each participating employee's account or continue the stock
purchase plan until the end of the current semi-annual period or such earlier
date as our board of directors may specify.

                 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

   In 1999 Millipore made a $450,000 loan, collateralized by real estate, to
Michael P. Carroll, a former executive officer in Millipore's microelectronics
division in connection with a relocation to the Allen, Texas facility. Pursuant
to the separation, this loan was transferred to us by Millipore. Upon the
termination of the former executive's employment with Millipore in February
2001, the loan by its terms would have become payable. Pursuant to the
severance arrangements with this former executive, the payment of this loan was
deferred until the earlier of the sale of the collateral by the former
executive or August 14, 2001. In the event that the loan is not paid on the due
date, we are entitled to apply severance payments due to the former executive
against the outstanding principal balance of the loan or foreclose on the
collateral, at our option. In addition, we are entitled to recover any
appreciation realized on the sale of the collateral. The loan bears no
interest.

                  ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN MYKROLIS AND MILLIPORE

   We have provided below a summary description of the executed master
separation and distribution agreement along with the key related agreements.
This description, which summarizes the material terms of the agreements, is not
complete. You should read the full text of these agreements, which have been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. We believe that none
of these agreements would have had a material impact on the historical
financial statements presented elsewhere in this prospectus had such agreements
been in place for the periods presented.

Master Separation and Distribution Agreement

   The master separation and distribution agreement contains the key provisions
relating to our separation from Millipore, this offering and the distribution
of our shares to Millipore stockholders.

   The Separation. The separation occurred on March 31, 2001. The master
separation and distribution agreement provides for the transfer to us of assets
and liabilities from Millipore related to our business as described in this
prospectus, effective on the separation date. The various ancillary agreements
that are exhibits to the separation agreement and which detail the separation
and various interim and ongoing relationships between Millipore and us
following the separation date include:

  .   a general assignment and assumption agreement;

  .   intellectual property ownership and transfer agreements, including a
      master patent assignment, master invention disclosure assignment,
      master trademark assignment, master patent license agreement, master
      patent grantback license agreement, master trademark license agreement
      and master trade secret and know-how agreement;

  .   a plan of reorganization of operations outside the U.S.;

  .   a tax sharing agreement;

  .   an employee matters agreement;

  .   a master transitional services agreement;

  .   a membrane manufacture and supply agreement;

  .   a research agreement;

  .   a product distribution agreement;

  .   two contract manufacturing agreements;

  .   a separation revolving credit agreement; and

  .   a separation note.

                                       73
<PAGE>

To the extent that the terms of any of these ancillary agreements conflict with
the separation agreement, the terms of the ancillary agreements will govern.

   The Initial Public Offering. Under the terms of the separation agreement,
Millipore will own at least 80.1% of our outstanding common stock following
this offering. We are obligated to use our reasonable commercial efforts to
satisfy the following conditions to the consummation of this offering, any of
which may be waived by Millipore:

  .  the registration statement containing this prospectus must be effective;

  .   U.S. securities and blue sky laws must be satisfied;

  .   our common stock must be listed on the New York Stock Exchange;

  .   all our obligations under the underwriting agreement must be met or
      waived by the underwriters;

  .   Millipore must own at least 80.1% of our stock and must be satisfied
      that the distribution will be tax-free to its U.S. stockholders;

  .   no legal restraints must exist preventing the separation or this
      offering or any transactions contemplated by the separation agreement;

  .   the separation must have occurred; and

  .   the separation agreement must not have been terminated.

   The Distribution. Millipore intends, approximately six months following
consummation of this offering, to distribute the remaining shares of our common
stock that Millipore holds to Millipore stockholders on a pro rata basis. We
will prepare an information statement with Millipore and send it to Millipore
stockholders before the distribution becomes effective. The information
statement will inform the stockholders of the distribution and its specifics.
Millipore may, in its sole discretion but subject to the terms of the
underwriter lock-up agreement, change the distribution date. Millipore intends
to consummate the distribution only if the following conditions are met, any of
which may be waived by Millipore:

  . the Internal Revenue Service must issue a ruling that the distribution of
    our common stock will be tax-free to Millipore stockholders and that the
    transaction will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax
    purposes. Millipore received this ruling from the Internal Revenue
    Service on June 18, 2001;

  . all required government approvals must be in effect;

  . no legal restraints must exist preventing this distribution; and

  . nothing must have happened in the intervening time between this offering
    and the distribution that makes the distribution harmful to Millipore or
    its stockholders.

   Covenants Between Mykrolis and Millipore. In addition to signing documents
that transfer control and ownership of various assets and liabilities of
Millipore relating to our business, we have agreed with Millipore to enter into
additional transitional services agreements, exchange information, maintain
internal accounting controls, engage in auditing practices and resolve disputes
in particular ways.

   Additional Transitional Service Agreements. Millipore and we have entered
into transitional services agreements covering the provision of various
transitional services, including financial, accounting, tax, facilities and
site services, sales, customer support, human resources administration, supply
chain services and information technology services by Millipore to us. In
addition, we may provide similar transitional services to Millipore on similar
terms. These services will generally be provided for a fee equal to direct and
indirect costs of providing the services. The transitional service agreements
will generally have a term of one year or less from the date of separation.
From the separation date until the closing of this offering, we will continue
to use the worldwide treasury and cash management services of Millipore. Our
cash needs will be supplied by Millipore pursuant to the separation revolving
credit agreement described below and our excess cash balances generated from
our operations will continue to be available to Millipore.

                                       74
<PAGE>

   Information Exchange. Both Millipore and we have agreed to share information
relating to governmental, accounting, contractual and other similar
requirements of our ongoing businesses, unless the sharing would be
commercially detrimental. In furtherance of this, both Millipore and we have
agreed as follows:

  . Each party has agreed to maintain adequate internal accounting to allow
    the other party to satisfy its own reporting obligations and prepare its
    own financial statements.

  . Each party will retain records beneficial to the other party for a period
    of time. If the records are to be destroyed, the destroying party will
    give the other party an opportunity to retrieve all relevant information
    from the records, unless the records are destroyed in accordance with
    record retention policies currently in effect.

  . Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other
    party with directors, officers, employees, other personnel and agents who
    may be used as witnesses in and books, records and other documents which
    may reasonably be required in connection with legal, administrative or
    other proceedings.

   Auditing Practices. So long as Millipore is required to consolidate our
results of operations and financial position, we have agreed to:

  . not select a different independent accounting firm from that used by
    Millipore without Millipore's consent;

  . use reasonable commercial efforts to enable our auditors to complete
    their audit procedures on our audited annual financial statements on the
    same date as Millipore's auditors complete their audit procedures on
    Millipore's audited annual financial statements and to complete quarterly
    review procedures on or before the date that Millipore's auditors
    complete their review of Millipore's quarterly financial statements;

  . exchange all relevant information needed to prepare financial statements;

  . grant each other's internal auditors access to each other's records and
    auditing personnel; and

  . notify each other of any change in accounting principles.

   Employee Agreements. The employee agreements of all former Millipore
employees transferred to us will remain in force, but the separation and
distribution by Millipore will not trigger a breach or termination of the
agreements. Millipore will assign the agreements to us but will retain the
right to enforce the agreements in order to protect its rights and interests.
In addition, neither Millipore nor we will commence a legal action to enforce
an employee agreement prior to consulting with each other.

   Confidentiality. Both parties agree not to disclose confidential information
of the other party except in specific circumstances. Millipore and we also
agree not to use this information in violation of any use restrictions in any
of the other written agreements between us.

   General Release of Pre-Separation Claims. Effective as of the separation
date, subject to specified exceptions, we released Millipore and its
subsidiaries and affiliated companies and each of their respective directors,
officers and employees, and Millipore released us and our subsidiaries and
affiliated companies and each of our and our subsidiaries' and affiliated
companies' respective directors, officers and employees, from any liabilities
arising from events occurring on or before the separation date, including
events occurring in connection with the activities to implement the separation,
this offering and the distribution. This provision will not impair a party from
enforcing the separation agreement, any ancillary agreement or any arrangement
specified in any of these agreements.

   Indemnification. In general, we have agreed to indemnify Millipore and its
affiliates, agents, successors and assigns from all liabilities arising from:

  . our business, any of our liabilities or any of our contracts or
    commitments, other than taxes, which is governed by the tax sharing
    agreement;

                                       75
<PAGE>

  . any breach by us of the separation agreement or any ancillary agreement;
    and

  . any liabilities related to this offering.

   As such, we will bear any liability arising from any untrue statement of a
material fact or any omission of a material fact in this prospectus or
otherwise arising out of this offering. However, insofar as indemnification for
liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to our
directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions
described above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public
policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.
Notwithstanding the Securities and Exchange Commission's position, if the
indemnification is found to be enforceable, we will be obligated to indemnify
Millipore for any such liabilities arising out of this offering.

   Millipore has agreed to indemnify us and our affiliates, agents, successors
and assigns from all liabilities arising from:

  . Millipore's business other than the Mykrolis business, and other than
    taxes, which is governed by the tax sharing agreement; and

  . any breach by Millipore of the separation agreement or any ancillary
    agreement.

   The amounts paid pursuant to these indemnification provisions will be
reduced by amounts collected from insurance. The agreement also contains
provisions governing notice and indemnification procedures.

   Dispute Resolution. If problems arise between Millipore and us, we have
agreed to the following dispute resolution procedures:

  . The parties will make a good faith effort to first resolve the dispute
    through negotiation.

  . If negotiations fail, the parties agree to attempt to resolve the dispute
    through non-binding mediation.

  . If mediation fails, the parties will resort to binding arbitration unless
    mutually agreed otherwise. In addition, nothing prevents either party
    acting in good faith from initiating litigation if failure to do so would
    cause such suit to be barred by an applicable statute of limitations or
    if such litigation seeks only injunctive relief in order to prevent
    irreparable harm.

   No Representations and Warranties. Millipore is not making any promises to
us regarding:

  . the value of any asset that Millipore is transferring;

  . whether there is a lien or encumbrance on any asset Millipore is
    transferring; or

  . the legal sufficiency of any conveyance of title to any asset Millipore
    is transferring.

   No Solicitation. Each party has agreed not to directly solicit or recruit
employees of the other party without the other party's consent for two years
after the distribution date. However, this prohibition does not apply to
general recruitment efforts carried out through public or general solicitation
or where the solicitation is employee-initiated.

   Expenses. All of the costs and expenses related to this offering as well as
the costs and expenses related to the separation and distribution will be
allocated between Millipore and us. It is anticipated that the costs and
expenses associated with this offering will be paid out of the proceeds of this
offering, and Millipore will bear the costs and expenses associated with the
distribution. We will each bear our own internal costs incurred in consummating
these transactions and the separation.

   Termination of the Agreement. Millipore in its sole discretion can terminate
the separation agreement and all ancillary agreements and abandon the
distribution at any time prior to the closing of this offering. In addition,
Millipore and we may mutually agree to terminate the separation agreement and
all ancillary agreements at any time between the closing of this offering and
the date of the distribution.

General Assignment and Assumption Agreement

   The general assignment and assumption agreement identifies the assets
Millipore transferred to us and the liabilities we assumed from Millipore in
the separation. The agreement also describes when and how these transfers and
assumptions occurred or will occur.

   Asset Transfer. Effective on the separation date, Millipore transferred
assets, including inventory, to us that related to our business, to the extent
that the assets were, prior to the separation date, Millipore assets.

   Excluded Assets. The general assignment and assumption agreement also
provides that Millipore did not and will not transfer specified accounts
receivable generated by our foreign subsidiaries and specified other assets
related to our business. While these receivables and other assets have not been
transferred because of restrictions imposed by foreign laws or because such
transfer is not practicable, our agreements with Millipore provide that we will
receive the economic benefits and bear the economic costs associated with these
receivables and other assets from the separation date. Other than those assets
covered by the separation agreements with Millipore, such as the membrane
manufacture and supply agreement and the contract manufacturing agreement,
which assets are also used by Millipore in the conduct of its business,
Millipore has transferred to us all material assets necessary to conduct the
business previously operated as the microelectronics division of Millipore. We
have received from Millipore, whether by transfer, lease, license or otherwise,
the assets and technologies necessary for us to conduct the business previously
operated as the microelectronics division of Millipore.

   Assumption of Liabilities. Effective on the separation date, we assumed
liabilities from Millipore, including liabilities related to specified
litigation, to the extent that these liabilities were, prior to the separation
date, liabilities held by Millipore related to our business and except as
provided in an ancillary or other agreement.

   Excluded Liabilities. The general assignment and assumption agreement also
provides that we will not assume specified liabilities, including:

  . specified accounts payable owed by our foreign subsidiaries;

  . any liabilities that would otherwise be allocated to us but which are
    covered by Millipore's insurance policies, unless we are a named insured
    under such policies; and

  . other specified liabilities.

   While these liabilities have not been transferred because of restrictions
imposed by foreign laws or because such transfer is impracticable, our
agreements with Millipore provide that we will bear the economic costs
associated with these liabilities from the separation date.

   Cash Payment. If the value of the excluded assets that are retained by
Millipore exceeds the value of the excluded liabilities retained by Millipore,
Millipore will make a cash payment to us equal to the difference between the
book value of such assets that are retained and the book value of the
liabilities that are retained, provided that any such amounts owed to us by
Millipore shall first be used to reduce any outstanding balance owed by us to
Millipore under the separation revolving credit agreement described below.
Likewise, we will make a cash payment to Millipore if the value of the excluded
assets is less than the value of the excluded liabilities. Any such amounts
payable by us to Millipore will be included in the outstanding balance under
our separation revolving credit agreement and will be paid in accordance with
the terms of the separation revolving credit agreement. We expect that this
cash payment either to us or from us, which relates mainly to accounts
receivables and accounts payables not transferred at the separation, will not
exceed $10.0 million.

   Delayed Transfers. Because it was not practicable to transfer specified
assets and liabilities on the separation date, the agreement provides that
these assets and liabilities will be formally transferred after the separation
date.

                                       77
<PAGE>

   Terms of Other Ancillary Agreements Govern. If another ancillary agreement
expressly provides for the transfer of an asset or an assumption of a
liability, the terms of the other ancillary agreement will determine the manner
of the transfer and assumption.

   Obtaining Approvals and Consents. The parties agree to use all reasonable
commercial efforts to obtain any required consents, substitutions or amendments
required to novate or assign all rights and obligations under any contracts
that will be transferred in the separation.

   Nonrecurring Costs and Expenses. Any nonrecurring costs and expenses that
are not allocated in the separation agreement or any other ancillary agreement
shall be the responsibility of the party that incurs the costs and expenses.

Master Patent Assignment and Master Invention Disclosure Assignment

   The master patent assignment, together with the master invention disclosure
assignment, master patent license agreement, the master patent grantback
license agreement, the master trademark assignment, the master trademark
license agreement and the master trade secret and know-how agreement, govern
the ownership and other rights associated with the intellectual property
between Millipore and us. These agreements also effect the transfer of
Millipore's rights in the different intellectual property to be consummated in
connection with the separation. In the event of an acquisition of either party,
the acquired party may assign these agreements, subject to the acquiring
company's agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the agreements,
except that we cannot, however, directly or indirectly assign the master
trademark license agreement. The agreements prohibit Millipore from using any
of the transferred or licensed technology in fields of use in the
microelectronics industry but Millipore may compete against us in the
microelectronics industry using newly developed or acquired technology.

   The master patent assignment and the master invention disclosure assignment
together effect the transfer to us of the full, exclusive and worldwide right
of Millipore's rights in specified inventions related to our business and the
entire right, title and interest in any letters patents that may be granted on
such inventions anywhere in the world. These patent and invention disclosure
assignments allocate rights relating to patents, patent applications and
invention disclosures. In these patent and invention disclosure assignments,
Millipore will assign to us patents, patent applications and invention
disclosures that were developed by us.

Master Patent License Agreement

   The master patent license agreement, or the patent license agreement,
provides for Millipore to license its rights in specified patents to us in our
field of use in the microelectronics industry. The patent license agreement
will remain in effect until the last of the patents licensed thereunder expire,
are otherwise terminated, or the patent license agreement is earlier terminated
in accordance with its terms. In each of the three years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, less than 5% of
our revenues were derived from products using technology owned by Millipore.

   Under the patent license agreement, Millipore granted to us a personal,
irrevocable, exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free and non-
transferable (except in limited circumstances) license to use specified patents
to commonly used inventions to make, have made, use, sell or otherwise dispose
of products in our field of use in the microelectronics industry. Millipore has
also granted to us a personal, irrevocable and exclusive option until March 31,
2006 to obtain a license under specified other patents. The option relates to
patents that may be useful for our future products but are not currently
utilized by us. If this option is exercised with respect to any of the optioned
patents, the license granted will be personal, irrevocable, exclusive,
worldwide, with no upfront fee, but with a 5% royalty based on net sales, and
will be non-transferable (except in limited circumstances), to use the optioned
patent to make, have made, use, sell, or otherwise dispose of products in our
field of use in the microelectronics industry. Millipore will retain all rights
to these licensed patents, including the rights of ownership, the right of use
in all fields except for our field of use in the microelectronics industry, and
the right to license third parties to use the patents except in our field of
use.

                                       78
<PAGE>

   We may grant sublicenses to our subsidiaries to use these licensed patents,
provided that we enter into a written sublicense agreement with the respective
subsidiary, and such agreement does not include the right to grant further
sublicenses other than to another one of our subsidiaries. If any sublicensed
subsidiary ceases to be a subsidiary of us, the sublicense granted to that
subsidiary will terminate 180 days from the date of such cessation.

Master Patent Grantback License Agreement

   The master patent grantback license agreement, or the patent grantback
agreement, grants back to Millipore a license, in Millipore's field of use in
the biopharmaceutical, life sciences, laboratory and food and beverage
industries, to use specified patents that have been assigned to us in
connection with the separation. The patent grantback agreement will remain in
effect until the last of the patents licensed thereunder expire, are otherwise
terminated, or the agreement is earlier terminated in accordance with its
terms.

   Under the patent grantback agreement, we granted to Millipore a personal,
irrevocable, exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid, royalty-free and non-
transferable (except in limited circumstances) license to specified patents
that were assigned to us, to use these patents to commonly used inventions to
make, have made, use, sell or otherwise dispose of products in the Millipore
field of use in the biopharmaceutical and related industries. We also granted
to Millipore a personal, irrevocable and exclusive option until March 31, 2006
to obtain a license under specified other patents. The option relates to
patents that may be useful for Millipore's future products but are not
currently utilized by Millipore. If the option with regard to any of these
other patents is exercised, the license granted will be personal, irrevocable,
exclusive, worldwide, with no upfront fee, but with a 5% royalty based on net
sales. The license will be non-transferable (except in limited circumstances)
to use these other patents to make, have made, use, sell, or otherwise dispose
of products in the Millipore field of use in the biopharmaceutical and related
industries. We retained all rights to the licensed patents and any other
optioned patents, including the right of ownership, the right of use in all
fields except for Millipore's field of use, and the right to license third
parties to use the patents except in Millipore's field of use.

   Millipore may grant sublicenses to its subsidiaries to use the licensed
patents, provided that Millipore enters into a written sublicense agreement
with the respective subsidiary, and such agreement does not include the right
to grant further sublicenses other than to another Millipore subsidiary. If any
sublicensed subsidiary ceases to be a subsidiary, the sublicense granted to
such subsidiary will terminate 180 days from the date of such cessation.

Master Trademark Assignments and Master Trademark License Agreement

   The master trademark assignments allocate rights relating to specified
trademarks, service marks and trade names. In the master trademark assignment,
Millipore assigned to us the trademarks, service marks and trade names that we
use in connection with our business.

   The master trademark license agreement grants us, subject to specified
restrictions, a personal, non-exclusive, worldwide, fully-paid and non-
transferable license, with the right to sublicense to our subsidiaries, to use
the "Millipore" trademark on our business products and corporate identity
materials in connection with the sale, offer for sale, advertisement and
promotion of our products. We may not:

  .  make any use of any other mark owned by Millipore;

  .  use the Millipore mark alone or in conjunction with any term other than
     "microelectronics" or such other mark or term as is proposed by us and
     agreed to in writing by Millipore in its sole discretion;

  .  use the mark in direct association with any other mark such that the two
     marks appear to be a single mark; or

  .  use the mark in connection with any products or services other than our
     products. Millipore will retain all rights in and to the "Millipore"
     mark, including:

                                       79
<PAGE>

    --the right of ownership in all fields of use;

    --the right to use the "Millipore" mark, either alone or in combination
     with other marks; and

    --the right to license third parties to use the "Millipore" mark, either
     alone or in combination with other marks.

   This license has a three-year term subject to one automatic one-year
renewal. However, we may voluntarily terminate this license agreement and the
rights granted to us under this agreement by written notice to Millipore. In
addition, pursuant to the terms of this trademark license agreement, we must
develop our own trademarks to replace the Millipore trademark in our business
within eighteen months of the separation date, and we must make regular
commercial use of these new trademarks within 24 months of the separation
date.

Master Trade Secret and Know-How Agreement

   The master trade secret and know-how agreement, or the know-how agreement,
governs the assignment, license and sublicense of trade secrets and know-how,
including technical data and other information that is not otherwise in the
public domain.

   Know-how that is used solely by us after the separation date has been
assigned to us, and Millipore and we have each retained the right, in our
respective fields of use, to use other know-how that is applicable to both our
products and Millipore's products. Millipore has licensed to us, in our field
of use in the microelectronics industry, any know-how that is commonly used by
both Millipore and us. Each field of use license is personal, exclusive,
worldwide, fully-paid and non-transferable. The licensee is permitted to grant
sublicenses to its subsidiaries in accordance with the know-how agreement,
provided that any sublicense terminates 180 days after the sublicensee ceases
to be a subsidiary. No sublicensee may grant further sublicenses.

   The know-how agreement will survive for so long as the licensed know-how
remains confidential and is used by the receiving party in its field of use,
or until voluntarily terminated by the receiving party.

Tax Sharing Agreement

   The tax sharing agreement allocates responsibilities for tax matters
between Millipore and us. The agreement requires us to pay Millipore for the
incremental tax costs of our inclusion in consolidated, combined or unitary
tax returns with Millipore's affiliated corporations for the period between
the separation of our business operations from Millipore and the distribution,
if any. The agreement also provides for compensation or reimbursement as
appropriate to reflect redeterminations of our tax liability for periods
during which we joined in filing consolidated, combined or unitary tax
returns.

   The tax sharing agreement also allocates any taxes and tax credits that
arise in connection with the restructuring of Millipore's foreign operations
into either Mykrolis or Millipore operations. These tax allocations are
generally based on the relative, regional profits of Millipore's
microelectronics business, on the one hand, and its biopharmaceutical and
other businesses, on the other, over the last three years.

   The tax sharing agreement also requires us to indemnify Millipore for
specified taxes and similar obligations, including any taxes that we are
responsible for under the terms of the tax sharing agreement. We are also
required to indemnify Millipore for any additional taxes that would result if
our actions, or an acquisition of a controlling interest in our stock, result
in failure to qualify the distribution as a tax-free distribution of a
controlled corporation. Our indemnity obligations include any interest and
penalties on taxes for which we must indemnify Millipore.

   In addition, the tax sharing agreement requires that Millipore indemnify us
for specified taxes and similar obligations, including any taxes that
Millipore is responsible for under the terms of the tax sharing agreement.
Millipore is required to indemnify us for any additional taxes that would
result if Millipore's actions result in

                                      80
<PAGE>

failure to qualify the distribution as a tax-free distribution of a controlled
corporation. Millipore's indemnity obligations include any interest and
penalties on taxes for which it must indemnify us. If the distribution fails to
so qualify as a result of the actions of both Millipore and us, we will share
the liability in proportion to our relative market values.

   Each member of a consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes is
jointly and severally liable for the group's federal income tax liability.
Accordingly, we could be required to pay a deficiency in the group's federal
income tax liability for a period during which we were a member of the group
even if the tax sharing agreement allocates that liability to Millipore or
another member.

   The tax sharing agreement also assigns responsibilities for administrative
matters, such as the filing of returns, payment of taxes due, retention of
records and conduct of audits, examinations or similar proceedings.

Plan of Reorganization of Operations Outside of the United States

   The plan of reorganization of operations outside of the United States
details the steps by which the separation of our business from Millipore
outside of the United States is to be effected. Detailed provisions governing
these transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities are established under
agreements entered into between our respective international subsidiaries. In
some foreign countries, such as France, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, a
new local subsidiary was established to receive the assets and liabilities of
our business. In other foreign countries, such as Japan, Korea, Singapore,
Taiwan and the United Kingdom, we have retained the "legacy" Millipore
subsidiary or branch and a new subsidiary of Millipore was established to
receive the assets and liabilities of the retained Millipore businesses.

   The plan of reorganization of operations outside of the United States
coordinates with the general assignment and assumption agreement, which
acknowledges that circumstances in jurisdictions outside of the United States
may require that the timing of the international separation be delayed past the
separation date. Millipore and we have begun the process of formally recording
these transfers, and our agreements provide for us to obtain the economic
benefits and bear the economic costs associated with these assets and
liabilities as of the separation date. We expect that the transfer of all
material assets located in foreign jurisdictions will be completed prior to the
consummation of this offering.

   In a number of Asian countries where we have retained the Millipore "legacy"
subsidiary it was impractical to transfer some of the assets or liabilities,
such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, belonging to the retained
Millipore businesses to the new Millipore subsidiary. As a result, we retained
those assets and liabilities in exchange for Millipore retaining assets and
liabilities of ours located in other countries having substantially equivalent
values. Any difference in value between these offsetting assets and liabilities
will be resolved by an appropriate credit or charge under the separation
revolving credit agreement.

Employee Matters Agreement

   The employee matters agreement allocates assets, liabilities and
responsibilities relating to current and former employees of Mykrolis and their
participation in the benefits plans, including deferred compensation,
insurance, health, 401(k), retirement and stock plans that Millipore currently
sponsors and maintains.

   All eligible Mykrolis employees will continue to participate in the
Millipore benefits plans on comparable terms and conditions to those for
Millipore employees until such date as is agreed between us and Millipore. In
most cases, we established our own benefit plans as of the separation but, in
limited cases, will establish them at a later date that is agreed to between us
and Millipore.

   Once we have established our own benefits plans, we may modify or terminate
each plan in accordance with the terms of that plan and our policies. No
Mykrolis benefit plan will provide benefits that overlap benefits under the
corresponding Millipore benefit plan at the time of the distribution. Each
Mykrolis benefit plan will provide that all service, compensation and other
benefit determinations that, as of the distribution, were recognized under the
corresponding Millipore benefit plan will be taken into account under that
Mykrolis benefit plan.

                                       81
<PAGE>

   Assets relating to the employee liabilities have been or will be transferred
to Mykrolis or the related Mykrolis plans and trusts from trusts and other
funding vehicles associated with Millipore's benefits plans. In connection with
the establishment of our benefit plans and the related transfer of assets from
Millipore to us, Millipore may provide us, and we may provide Millipore, with
transitional services related to the organization and implementation of our
benefit plans.

   Options. We have established a replacement stock plan for eligible Mykrolis
employees. We will assume all unvested Millipore options held by Mykrolis
directors, officers and employees. These options will convert at the
distribution into options to purchase our common stock. The number of shares
and the exercise price of Millipore options that convert into Mykrolis options
will be adjusted using a conversion formula. The conversion formula will be
based on the opening per share price of our common stock on the first trading
day after the distribution relative to the closing per share price of Millipore
common stock on the last trading day before the distribution. The resulting
Mykrolis options will maintain the original vesting provisions and option
period.

   Restricted Stock. Unless otherwise agreed among Millipore, a restricted
stockholder and us, Millipore restricted stock granted under incentive stock
plans and held by Mykrolis employees will become fully vested on the
distribution date.

   Stock Purchase Plan. We anticipate that Mykrolis employees will continue to
participate in the Millipore stock purchase plan through the date of this
offering. After that time, we will sponsor a stock purchase plan for the
benefit of Mykrolis employees that is comparable to the Millipore stock
purchase plan.

Master Transitional Services Agreement

   The master transitional services agreement governs the provision of
transitional services by Millipore and us to each other, on an interim basis,
until one year after the separation date, unless extended by mutual agreement
for specific services or otherwise indicated in the agreement. The services
include data processing and telecommunications services, such as voice
telecommunications and data transmission, engineering services, financial
services, distribution and warehouse services, facilities sharing services,
product order administration, legal services, human resource services and
information technology support services for functions including financial,
accounting, tax, real estate and site services, sales, customer support, human
resources administration, supply chain management and other administrative
functions. Services are generally charged at cost. The master transitional
services agreement also covers the provision of additional transitional
services identified from time to time after the separation date that were
inadvertently or unintentionally omitted from the specified services, or that
are essential to effectuate an orderly transition under the separation
agreement. The provision of such services must not, however, significantly
disrupt Millipore's or our operations or significantly increase the scope of
its or our responsibility under the agreement. We may terminate any or all
services provided under the services agreement, for any reason or no reason,
with 60 days prior written notice to Millipore.

Membrane Manufacture and Supply Agreement

   The membrane manufacture and supply agreement, or the membrane agreement,
governs the rights and obligations of Millipore and us with respect to the
manufacture and sale of specified membranes and related materials that are used
by and incorporated into our products and Millipore's products. The membrane
agreement is intended to assure that there will not be a disruption in our
ability to manufacture and utilize these membranes as a result of the
separation. The membrane agreement has a five-year term. Less than 5% of our
net sales in 2000 resulted from products using these membranes.

   Manufacture. Millipore will lease to us manufacturing space in its Bedford,
Massachusetts facility that is currently used to manufacture these membranes
and related materials. The lease will be for a five-year term, subject to our
right to terminate the lease earlier on twelve months prior written notice. We
will pay Millipore rent at a rate that approximates its cost for such space,
subject to an annual 5% increase. In addition, Millipore

                                       82
<PAGE>

will provide us with access to, and the use of, specified Millipore equipment
that is needed in the manufacturing process. We will pay Millipore for use of
its equipment and for Millipore supervisory, operational assistance and
technical support at the rates set forth in the membrane agreement.

   Following termination of the membrane agreement, Millipore may exercise its
rights to a personal, irrevocable, fully-paid, worldwide, exclusive, royalty-
free license to our intellectual property rights, limited to Millipore's field
of use in the biopharmaceutical and related industries, relating to the
manufacture, use and sale of these membranes and products incorporating these
membranes. Similarly, we may exercise our rights to a personal, irrevocable,
fully-paid, worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free license to Millipore's
intellectual property rights, limited to our field of use outside of the
biopharmaceutical and related industries, relating to the manufacture, use and
sale of these membranes and products incorporating these membranes. These
licenses are assignable to third parties only in limited circumstances. We will
also provide Millipore with the know-how and transitional assistance necessary
for Millipore to be able to continue to manufacture these membranes and
Millipore will provide us with know-how and transitional assistance relating to
Millipore's equipment so that we can make or have made comparable equipment or
outsource the manufacturing functions performed by the Millipore equipment. All
of our transition assistance time and all of Millipore's transition assistance
time will be charged to Millipore and us, respectively, at the rates set forth
in the membrane agreement. In addition, upon termination of the lease,
Millipore will have the right to purchase equipment from us that is used in the
manufacture of these membranes at the then current book values.

   Supply. During the term of the membrane agreement, we will sell to Millipore
specified membranes and Millipore will sell to us other types of membranes.
Neither of us will have any minimum or maximum purchase requirements or
limitations for these membranes, subject to binding three-month forecasts that
are not subject to decrease but may be increased up to 30% without penalty.
Other than the three-month forecasts, updated quarterly, the forecasts of
demand for products will not be binding on either party. The pricing for
membranes is cost plus 20%, and prices will be reviewed annually and adjusted
to reflect actual changes in the cost of manufacturing the membranes. Other
than as described above and subject to existing distribution agreements,
Millipore will not sell these membranes outside of its core business in the
biopharmaceutical market. Similarly, we will not sell these membranes into
Millipore's core business in the biopharmaceutical market or, in limited
circumstances, outside of our core business in the microelectronics industry.

Research Agreement

   The research agreement provides for Millipore employees to perform specific
research projects for us. The research agreement covers four research projects
that are currently in progress and is intended to ensure that these projects
are not delayed or impaired as a result of the separation. The projects relate
to filter technology. The agreement has a five-year term, subject to earlier
termination by us on twelve-months notice to Millipore or if either Millipore
or we are acquired by a competitor to the other. In addition, we may terminate
a particular project at any time but must pay for the use of Millipore
personnel through the end of the contract year, less any costs mitigated by
Millipore. We will pay Millipore for the services and facilities provided to us
under the research agreement at a rate that approximates its costs for such
services and facilities.

   Each party will have the exclusive right to use, in their respective fields
of use, any additional know-how developed in the course of these research
projects that relates to or improves upon previously existing membrane
technology. In addition, all inventions created pursuant to the research
agreement will be our property, subject to Millipore's right to utilize
products incorporating these inventions in its field of use in the
biopharmaceutical and related industries. In exchange for this exclusive
license, Millipore will pay us 5% of net sales on these products for a period
of ten years from the separation date.

Product Distribution Agreement

   The product distribution agreement, or the distribution agreement, provides
for the distribution of specified products that are sold to customers of both
Millipore and us, but which will become products of either Millipore or us
following the separation date. Under the distribution agreement, subject to
existing distribution agreements, we will be the exclusive worldwide
distributor of Millipore products in our core business in the

                                       83
<PAGE>

microelectronics industry, and Millipore will be the exclusive worldwide
distributor of our products in Millipore's core business in the
biopharmaceutical and related industries. Neither party can resell the other's
products outside of these fields of use, and neither party may market its own
products within the other party's field of use. Each of us will sell our
products to the other party at a discount off the U.S. list price for such
product, which list prices are subject to annual increase. Neither of us will
have any minimum or maximum purchase requirements or limitations for
distributed products, subject to binding three-month forecasts that are subject
to a 25% increase or reduction without penalty. Other than the three-month
forecasts, updated quarterly, the forecasts of demand for products will not be
binding on either party. This agreement has a term of five years, unless
earlier terminated for cause, provided that the party acting as distributor may
terminate its rights under the agreement at any time upon 60 days prior written
notice. Both Millipore and we have agreed to maintain product liability
insurance for the distributed products with a minimum of $5 million coverage.

Contract Manufacturing Agreements

   The Millipore contract manufacturing agreement, or the manufacturing
agreement, provides for Millipore to manufacture specified products and parts
for us. Under the manufacturing agreement, Millipore will manufacture and sell
us the specified products for resale by us under our own trade names. We will
pay Millipore the prices set forth in the manufacturing agreement for these
products, subject to annual increases to cover actual increases in the cost to
manufacture these products. We may not resell these products into Millipore's
core business in the biopharmaceutical and related industries. We will not have
any minimum or maximum purchase requirements or limitations for manufactured
products, subject to binding three-month forecasts that are subject to a 25%
increase or reduction without penalty. Other than the three-month forecasts,
updated quarterly, the forecasts of demand for products will not be binding on
us. This agreement has a term of five years, unless earlier terminated for
cause, provided that we may terminate the agreement at any time upon sixty days
prior written notice. We have also agreed to manufacture parts for Millipore
for use in Millipore's products on substantially similar terms pursuant to the
Mykrolis contract manufacturing agreement. For the years ended December 31,
1998, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, we purchased
products from Millipore for inclusion in our products sold to third parties
totaling $4.3 million, $4.0 million, $4.0 million and $1.0 million,
respectively. In the same periods, products sold to Millipore by us were not
material.

Separation Revolving Credit Agreement and Separation Note

   The separation revolving credit agreement, or credit agreement, provides for
Millipore to lend us cash between the separation date and the date of this
offering in order to satisfy our working capital needs. Under the credit
agreement, we may borrow up to $100,000,000, in multiples of $100,000, from
Millipore at any time or from time to time prior to the repayment date. In
addition, the separation revolving credit agreement provides for a payment to
Millipore or credit to us based on the relative values of our assets and
liabilities retained by Millipore versus the Millipore assets and liabilities
retained by us at the separation date as a result of restrictions imposed by
foreign laws or because such transfer was not practical. All amounts borrowed
under the credit agreement must be repaid on the repayment date, which is the
earlier of fifteen days following the closing of this offering or December 31,
2002. No interest will accrue from the date of borrowing to the repayment date.
Thereafter, to the extent the borrowed amounts remain unpaid, interest will
accrue from the repayment date through the date of actual payment at the rate
of twelve-month LIBOR plus 1.5% per annum.

   The separation note provides for a payment by us to Millipore out of the
proceeds from this offering. Pursuant to the terms of the separation note, we
must pay Millipore, on the fifteenth day following the consummation of this
offering, an amount equal to the net proceeds received by us in this offering
after payment of all associated expenses including the underwriters' discount,
minus the outstanding balance under the separation revolving credit agreement,
minus $75.0 million that will be retained by us to fund our operations. The
separation note does not bear interest from the separation date through the
maturity date of the note. Thereafter, to the extent the note remains unpaid,
the separation note will bear interest at a rate equal to the base rate, as
defined in the separation note, plus 1.5% per annum. At March 31, 2001, the
interest rate would have been 9.5% per annum.

                             PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDER

   Prior to this offering, all of the outstanding shares of our common stock
will be owned by Millipore. After this offering, Millipore will own
approximately 82.3%, or about 80.1% if the underwriters fully exercise their
option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. Except for Millipore,
we are not aware of any person or group that will beneficially own more than 5%
of the outstanding shares of our common stock following this offering. None of
our directors or executive officers currently own any shares of our common
stock, but those who own shares of Millipore common stock will be treated on
the same terms as other holders of Millipore stock in any distribution by
Millipore. See "Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers" for a
description of the ownership of Millipore stock by our directors and executive
officers. In addition, our directors and executive officers who own unvested
options to purchase shares of Millipore common stock will have these options
converted into options to purchase shares of our common stock at the time of
the distribution on the same terms as all of our employees that own unvested
options to purchase shares of Millipore common stock. See "Management--
Treatment of Millipore Options."

                          DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

General Matters

   Upon completion of this offering, the total amount of our authorized capital
stock will consist of 250,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares
of one or more series of preferred stock. As of March 31, 2001, we had
outstanding 32,500,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock.

   After giving effect to this offering we will have 39,500,000 shares of
common stock (40,550,000 shares if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full) and no shares of any series of preferred stock outstanding.
As of March 31, 2001, we had one stockholder of record with respect to our
common stock and no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock.
The following summary of provisions of our capital stock describes all material
provisions of, but does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and
qualified in its entirety by, our restated certificate of incorporation and our
amended and restated by-laws. Our restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws are included as exhibits to the registration
statement of which this prospectus forms a part.

   The restated certificate and amended and restated by-laws contain provisions
that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the
composition of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a future takeover or change in control of
Mykrolis unless such takeover or change in control is approved by our board of
directors.

Common Stock

   The issued and outstanding shares of common stock are, and the shares of
common stock to be issued by us in connection with the offering will be,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Subject to the prior rights of
the holders of any series of preferred stock, the holders of outstanding shares
of common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally
available therefor at such time and in such amounts as the board of directors
may from time to time determine. Please see "Dividend Policy." The shares of
common stock are not convertible and the holders thereof have no preemptive or
subscription rights to purchase any of our securities. Upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of Mykrolis, the holders of common stock are entitled
to receive pro rata our assets which are legally available for distribution,
after payment of all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior
rights of any holders of any series of preferred stock then outstanding. Each
outstanding share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders. There is no cumulative voting. Except as
otherwise required by law or the restated certificate, the holders of common
stock vote together will all other shares of capital stock as a single class on
all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including votes to increase
the number of authorized shares of common stock. As a result, if we issue
shares of capital stock other than common stock, including shares of preferred
stock with super voting rights, holders of those shares could influence
stockholder votes to increase the authorized shares of our common stock, which
could dilute your ownership of Mykrolis and reduce your control over matters
submitted to our stockholders.

   Our common stock has been approved for listing on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol "MYK."

Preferred Stock

   Our board of directors may, without further action by our stockholders, from
time to time, direct the issuance of shares of preferred stock in series and
may, at the time of issuance, determine the rights, preferences and limitations
of each series. Satisfaction of any dividend preferences of outstanding shares
of preferred stock would reduce the amount of funds available for the payment
of dividends on shares of common stock. Holders of shares of preferred stock
may be entitled to receive a preference payment in the event of any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Mykrolis before any payment is made
to the holders of shares of common stock. The issuance of shares of preferred
stock may render more difficult or tend to discourage a merger, tender offer or
proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our
securities or the removal of incumbent management. Upon the affirmative vote of
a majority of the total number of directors

                                       86
<PAGE>

then in office, the board of directors of Mykrolis, without stockholder
approval, may issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights
which could adversely affect the holders of shares of common stock. Following
the offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom as described
under "Use of Proceeds" there will be no shares of preferred stock outstanding.

   We have no current intention to issue any of our authorized but unissued
shares of preferred stock. However, the issuance of any shares of preferred
stock in the future could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common
stock.

Shareholder Rights Plan

   The board of directors of Mykrolis expects to implement a shareholder rights
plan following the consummation of this offering that will make it more
difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of
directors. Pursuant to the shareholder rights plan, Mykrolis will issue common
stock purchase rights. It is expected that under the shareholder rights plan,
one common stock purchase right will be issued for each outstanding share of
common stock held as of the date of adoption of the shareholder rights plan and
one common stock purchase right will be attached to each share of common stock
issued thereafter. The common stock purchase rights authorize the holders to
purchase shares of common stock at a 50% discount from market value upon the
occurrence of specified events, including, unless approved by our board of
directors, an acquisition by a person or group of specified levels of
beneficial ownership of our common stock or a tender offer for our common
stock. The common stock purchase rights are redeemable by us for $.01 and will
expire on the tenth anniversary of the date of adoption of the shareholder
rights plan. One of the events which will trigger the common stock purchase
rights is the acquisition, or commencement of a tender offer, by a person (an
Acquiring Person, as defined in the shareholder rights plan), other than
Mykrolis or any of our subsidiaries or employee benefit plans, of 15% or more
of the outstanding shares of our common stock. An Acquiring Person may not
exercise a common stock purchase right. It is expected that Millipore will be
excluded from the definition of Acquiring Person until the consummation of the
distribution. The description and terms of the shareholder rights plan will be
set forth in a common stock rights agreement that we expect to enter into with
Equiserve Trust Company, N.A., as rights agent. A copy of the form of common
stock rights agreement is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of
which this prospectus forms a part.

Other Provisions of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated By-laws

   Classified Board. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides for the
board to be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible,
serving staggered terms. Approximately one-third of the board will be elected
each year. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, directors serving on a
classified board can only be removed for cause. The provision for a classified
board could prevent a party who acquires control of a majority of the
outstanding voting stock from obtaining control of the board until the second
annual stockholders meeting following the date the acquiror obtains the
controlling stock interest. The classified board provision could have the
effect of discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or
otherwise attempting to obtain control of Mykrolis and could increase the
likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions.

   Elimination of Stockholder Action Through Written Consents. Our restated
certificate of incorporation provides that stockholder action can be taken only
at an annual or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written
consent in lieu of a meeting.

   Elimination of the Ability to Call Special Meetings. Our restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide that,
except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of the stockholders can
only be called pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of
directors or by our chairman or chief executive officer. Stockholders are not
permitted to call a special meeting or to require the board to call a special
meeting.

   Advanced Notice Procedures For Stockholder Proposals. Our amended and
restated by-laws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder
proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders,

                                       87
<PAGE>

including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board.
Stockholders at our annual meeting may only consider proposals or nominations
specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the board or by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on
the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who
has given to our secretary timely written notice, in proper form, of the
stockholder's intention to bring that business before the meeting. Although our
by-laws do not give the board the power to approve or disapprove stockholder
nominations of candidates or proposals regarding other business to be conducted
at a special or annual meeting, our by-laws may have the effect of precluding
the conduct of business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed
or may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation
of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to
obtain control of Mykrolis.

   Amendments to the Restated Certificate and Amended and Restated By-laws. Our
restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws provide
that the affirmative vote of holders of at least 75% of the total votes
eligible to be cast in the election of directors is required to amend, alter,
change or repeal provisions relating to by-law amendments, procedures for
electing and removing directors, calling special meetings of stockholders and
restrictions on stockholder actions by written consent. This requirement of a
super-majority vote to approve amendments to our restated certificate and by-
laws could enable a minority of our stockholders to exercise veto power over
any such amendments.

   No Cumulative Voting. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended
and restated by-laws do not provide for cumulative voting in the election of
directors.

   Undesignated Preferred Stock. The authorization of undesignated preferred
stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock
with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any
attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions may have the effect
of delaying or deterring hostile takeovers or changes in control or management
of us.

Provisions of Delaware Law Governing Business Combinations

   Following the consummation of this offering, we will be subject to the
"business combination" provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In
general, such provisions prohibit a publicly-held Delaware corporation from
engaging in various "business combination" transactions with any "interested
stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in
which the person became an "interested stockholder," unless:

  . the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the date
    the "interested stockholder" obtained such status;

  . upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder
    becoming an "interested stockholder," the "interested stockholder" owned
    at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the
    time the transaction commenced, excluding for purposes of determining the
    number of shares outstanding those shares owned by (a) persons who are
    directors and also officers, and (b) employee stock plans in which
    employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially
    whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or
    exchange offer; or

  . on or subsequent to such date the "business combination" is approved by
    the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of
    stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the
    outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the "interested
    stockholder."

   A "business combination" is defined to include mergers, asset sales and
other transactions resulting in financial benefit to a stockholder. In general,
an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates and
associates, owns 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock or within three
years did own 15% or more of a corporation's voting stock. The statute could
prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control attempts with
respect to Mykrolis and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire
Mykrolis.


                                       88
<PAGE>

   Because Millipore will own more than 15% of our voting stock before we
become a public company, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law by
its terms is currently not applicable to business combinations with Millipore
even though Millipore owns more than 15% of our outstanding stock. If any other
person acquires 15% or more of our outstanding stock, such person will be
subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

   Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more
difficult for an "interested stockholder" to effect various business
combinations with us for a three-year period, although our stockholders may
elect to exclude us from the restrictions imposed thereunder. By virtue of its
beneficial ownership of our common stock, Millipore is in a position to elect
to exclude us from the restrictions under Section 203. Currently, Millipore has
indicated to us that it has no intention to do so.

Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors

   Our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors
to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, our restated
certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and
officers to the fullest extent permitted by such law. We expect to enter into
indemnification agreements with our current directors and executive officers
prior to the completion of the offering and expect to enter into a similar
agreement with any new directors or executive officers. We expect to obtain
directors' and officers' insurance prior to the completion of this offering.

Transactions with Interested Parties

   Our restated certificate of incorporation includes provisions addressing
potential conflicts of interest between us and Millipore and its non-Mykrolis-
related subsidiaries and other similar entities. In addition, our restated
certificate of incorporation includes provisions regulating and defining our
conduct as it may involve us and Millipore and our and its subsidiaries,
directors and officers. Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that
we and Millipore and our and their respective subsidiaries may engage in the
same or similar business activities and lines of business and have an interest
in the same areas of corporate opportunities and that we and Millipore will
continue to have contractual and business relations with each other (including
service of directors and officers of Millipore as our directors and officers).

   Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, except as Millipore
may otherwise agree in writing, Millipore will have the right to:

  . engage in the same or similar business activities or lines of business as
    us; and

  . do business with any of our potential or actual customers or suppliers.

   Neither Millipore nor any officer, employee or director of Millipore will be
liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary or other duty by
reason of these activities. In addition, our restated certificate of
incorporation provides that no contract or transaction:

  . between us and Millipore or any of its non-Mykrolis-related subsidiaries
    and other similar entities; or

  . between us and any entity in which one or more of our directors or
    officers has a financial interest, which we refer to as a "related
    entity"; or

  . between us and any director or officer of our company, Millipore, any
    subsidiary of Millipore or any related entity;

                                       89
<PAGE>

shall be void or voidable solely because:

  . Millipore, any non-Mykrolis-related subsidiary or other similar entity of
    Millipore or any related entity, or any of their or our directors or
    officers are parties to the contract or transaction; or

  . any of those directors or officers is present at or participates in the
    meeting of the board of directors or committee thereof that authorizes
    the contract or transaction.

   Any disputes arising under this provision of our restated certificate of
incorporation will be resolved under Delaware law.

Corporate Opportunities

  In our restated certificate of incorporation, in accordance with Section
122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we have renounced any interest
in future business opportunities that are presented to Millipore, its
subsidiaries other than us, or our officers or directors who are employees or
directors of Millipore or its subsidiaries other than us, when the opportunity
is presented. If Millipore or one of our directors or officers who is also an
employee or director of Millipore acquires knowledge of a potential transaction
or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both Millipore and us, our
restated certificate of incorporation provides that the potential transaction
or matter that may be a corporate opportunity for both us and Millipore will
belong to Millipore and Millipore or such officer or director will have no duty
to communicate that opportunity to us and will not be liable to us or our
stockholders because Millipore pursues or acquires that corporate opportunity
for itself, directs that corporate opportunity to another person or entity or
does not present that corporate opportunity to us.

   Our directors or officers acting in accordance with the policy described
above:

  . will be deemed fully to have satisfied their fiduciary or other duties to
    us and our stockholders with respect to that corporate opportunity;

  . will not be liable to us or our stockholders for any breach of fiduciary
    duty by reason of the fact that Millipore pursues or acquires that
    opportunity for itself or directs that corporate opportunity to another
    person or does not communicate information regarding that opportunity to
    us;

  . will be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner they
    reasonably believe to be in our best interests; and

  . will be deemed not to have breached any duty of loyalty or other duty
    those persons may have to us or our stockholders and not to have derived
    an improper benefit from these actions.

   The corporate opportunity provisions in our restated certificate of
incorporation will expire on the date that Millipore ceases to beneficially own
common stock representing at least 20% of the combined voting power of
outstanding shares of our capital stock, and no person who is a director or
officer of Mykrolis is also a director or officer of Millipore.

   Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that any person
purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital
stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these
provisions. This provision restates the Delaware law principle that
stockholders are deemed to be on notice of the contents of a company's
certificate of incorporation and, to the extent the provisions are consistent
with Delaware law, shall be bound by the terms thereof. As such, the provision
is authorized by Delaware law. However, this provision does not preclude
stockholders from attempting to change this provision of the Mykrolis restated
certificate of incorporation through appropriate stockholder action or from
challenging the corporate opportunity provisions as not being in accordance
with Section 122(17) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

Transfer Agent and Registrar

   The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A.

<PAGE>

                        SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

   All of the shares of our common stock sold in this offering will be freely
tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for any shares
which be may acquired by an affiliate of Mykrolis, as that term is defined in
Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Persons who may be deemed to be affiliates
generally include individuals or entities that control, are controlled by, or
are under common control with, Mykrolis and may include directors and officers
of Mykrolis as well as significant stockholders of Mykrolis, if any.

   Millipore currently plans to complete its divestiture of Mykrolis
approximately six months following this offering by distributing all of the
shares of Mykrolis common stock owned by Millipore to the holders of
Millipore's common stock. Shares of our common stock distributed to Millipore
stockholders in the distribution generally will be freely transferable, except
for shares of common stock received by persons who may be deemed to be
affiliates. Persons who are affiliates will be permitted to sell the shares of
common stock that are issued in this offering or that they receive in the
distribution only through registration under the Securities Act, or under an
exemption from registration, such as the one provided by Rule 144.

   The shares of our common stock held by Millipore before distribution are
deemed "restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144, and may not be sold
other than through registration under the Securities Act or under an exemption
from registration, such as the one provided by Rule 144. We, our executive
officers and directors and Millipore have agreed, subject to exceptions, not to
offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or hedge any common stock
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock,
including in the case of Millipore by completing the distribution of our
shares, until 180 days after the date of this prospectus, referred to as the
lock-up period, without first obtaining the written consent of Banc of America
Securities LLC. In addition, shares sold in this offering pursuant to the
reserved share program will be subject to a 30-day lock-up period. Banc of
America Securities LLC may release us, any of our executive officers or
directors or Millipore and any recipient of shares in the reserved share
program from these agreements at any time during the applicable lock-up period,
in its sole discretion and without notice, as to some or all of the shares
covered by these lock-up agreements.


   We will grant shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock option plans.
See "Management--Stock Plans." We currently expect to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act to register shares reserved for issuance
under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, 2001 Non-Employee Director Stock Option
Plan and 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Shares issued pursuant to awards
after the effective date of the registration statement, other than shares
issued to affiliates, generally will be freely tradable without further
registration under the Securities Act. Shares issued pursuant to any unvested
Millipore options that are converted into our options will also be freely
tradable without registration under the Securities Act after the effective date
of the registration statement. See "Management--Treatment of Millipore
Options."

                                  UNDERWRITING

   We are offering shares of common stock described in this prospectus through
a number of underwriters. Banc of America Securities LLC, Salomon Smith Barney
Inc. and ABN AMRO Rothschild LLC are the representatives of the underwriters
and have negotiated on behalf of the underwriters and have entered into the
underwriting agreement with us. Subject to the terms and conditions of the

   The underwriting agreement is subject to a number of terms and conditions
and provides that the underwriters must buy all of the shares if they buy any
of them. The underwriters will sell the shares to the public when and if the
underwriters buy the shares from us.

   The underwriters will initially offer the shares of common stock to the
public at the price set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. The
underwriters may allow dealers a concession of not more than $    per share of
common stock. The underwriters may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a
concession of not more than $    per share of common stock to other dealers. If
all the shares are not sold at the public offering price, the underwriters may
change the public offering price and the other selling terms. No change in the
public offering price will vary the proceeds to be received by us as specified
on the cover page of the prospectus. The common stock is offered subject to a
number of conditions, including:

  .  receipt and acceptance of the common stock by the underwriters; and

  .  the right on the part of the underwriters to reject orders in whole or
     in part.

   We have granted an option to the underwriters to buy up to 1,050,000
additional shares of common stock. These additional shares would cover sales of
shares by the underwriters which exceed the number of shares specified in the
table above. The underwriters have 30 days to exercise this option. If the
underwriters exercise this option, they will each purchase additional shares
approximately in proportion to the amounts specified in the table above. If
purchased, the underwriters will offer such additional shares on the same terms
as those on which the 7,000,000 shares are being offered.

   The following table shows the per share and total underwriting discount to
be paid by us to the underwriters and the proceeds before expenses to us. These
amounts are shown assuming no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters'
option to purchase additional shares.

   The expenses of the offering, not including the underwriting discounts and
commissions, are estimated to be approximately $3,160,000 and will be paid by
us. Expenses of the offering, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and
commissions, include the SEC filing fee, the NASD filing fee, New York Stock
Exchange listing fees, printing expenses, transfer agent and registration and
other miscellaneous fees.

   We, our executive officers and directors and Millipore have entered into
lock-up agreements with the underwriters. Under those agreements, we may not
issue any new shares of our common stock, and our

                                       92
<PAGE>

executive officers and directors and Millipore may not, subject to exceptions,
offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or hedge any common stock
or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock,
including in the case of Millipore by completing the distribution of our
shares. These restrictions will be in effect for a period of 180 days after the
date of this prospectus. At any time and without notice, Banc of America
Securities LLC may, in its sole discretion, release all or some of the
securities from these lock-up agreements.

   We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against liabilities, including
liabilities for misstatements and omissions under the Securities Act of 1933
and liabilities arising from breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in the underwriting agreement, and to contribute to payments that the
underwriters may be required to make for these liabilities.

   In connection with this offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell
shares of our common stock in the open market. These transactions may include
stabilizing transactions, short sales and purchases to cover positions created
by short sales. Stabilizing transactions consist of bids or purchases made for
the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our
common stock while this offering is in progress. Short sales involve the sale
by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to
purchase in this offering.

   Short sales can be either "covered" or "naked." "Covered" short sales are
sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters' option to purchase
additional shares in this offering. The underwriters may close out any covered
short position by either exercising their over-allotment option or purchasing
shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the
covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the
price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the
price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option.
"Naked" short sales are sales in excess of the over-allotment option. The
underwriters must close out any naked position by purchasing shares in the open
market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters
are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the shares in
the open market after pricing of this offering that could adversely affect
investors who purchase in this offering.

   The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid. This means that if the
representatives purchase shares in the open market in stabilizing transactions
or to cover short sales, the representatives can require the underwriters that
sold those shares as part of this offering to repay the underwriting discount
received by them.

   These activities by the underwriters may have the effect of raising or
maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result of these
activities, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that
might otherwise exist in the open market. If the underwriters commence these
activities, they may discontinue them at any time. The underwriters may carry
out these transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter
market or otherwise.

   The underwriters do not expect sales to discretionary accounts to exceed 5%
of the total number of shares of common stock offered by this prospectus.

   Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common
stock. The initial public offering price will be negotiated between us and the
underwriters. The primary factors to be considered in such negotiations are:

  .  our history and prospects, and the history and prospects of the industry
     in which we compete;

  .  our past and present financial performance;

  .  an assessment of our management;

  .  the present state of our development;

  .  our prospects for future earnings;

                                       93
<PAGE>

  .  the prevailing market conditions of the applicable U.S. securities
     market at the time of this offer;

  . market valuations of publicly traded companies that we and the
    representatives believe to be comparable to us; and

  . other factors deemed relevant, such as the evaluation of the above
    factors in relation to the market valuation of companies in related
    businesses.

   At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the common stock
offered hereby for sale to our employees, families and friends of directors and
executive officers and other persons having business relationships with us at
the initial public offering price set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus. The sale of these reserved shares to these persons will be made by
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. We do not know if our employees, families and friends
and other persons having business relationships with us will choose to purchase
all or any portion of the reserved shares, but any purchases they do make will
reduce the number of shares available to the general public. If all of the
reserved shares are not purchased, the underwriters will offer the remainder to
the general public on the same terms as the other shares offered by this
prospectus. We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against liabilities
and expenses, including liabilities under the Securities Act, in connection
with the sales of reserved shares. As a condition to the purchase of reserved
shares, the purchasers will be required to agree that they may not, subject to
exceptions, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of or hedge any
such shares for a period of 30 days after the date of this prospectus. At any
time and without notice, Banc of America Securities LLC may, in its sole
discretion, release all or some of the securities from these lock-up
agreements.

   A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the Web sites
maintained by one or more underwriters or securities dealers. The
representatives of the underwriters may agree to allocate a number of shares to
underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet
distribution will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters that may
make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations. In
addition, shares may be sold by the underwriters to securities dealers who
resell shares to online brokerage account holders.

   Banc of America Securities LLC has been engaged by Millipore to provide
financial advisory services relating to the separation of its microelectronics
business and the distribution of shares of our common stock to Millipore
stockholders. As financial advisor to Millipore, Banc of America Securities LLC
will receive a customary cash fee from Millipore upon completion of the
distribution. Banc of America Securities LLC has from time to time performed
various investment banking services for Millipore in the past, and it may from
time to time in the future perform investment banking services for Millipore or
for us for which it has received or will receive customary fees. In addition,
Maureen Hendricks, a director of Millipore, is a Managing Director of Salomon
Smith Barney Inc., one of the representatives of the underwriters in this
offering.

   The validity of the shares of common stock offered hereby will be passed

                       Report of Independent Accountants

To the Board of Directors and Stockholder of
 Mykrolis Corporation (formerly known as Millipore MicroElectronics, Inc.)

   In our opinion, the combined financial statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Mykrolis Corporation (formerly known as Millipore MicroElectronics, Inc.) (the
"Company") a wholly-owned subsidiary of Millipore Corporation ("Millipore") at
December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   The Company is comprised of Millipore's microelectronics business which was
historically integrated with the businesses of Millipore; consequently, as
indicated in Note 1, these financial statements have been derived from the
consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Millipore, and
reflect significant assumptions and allocations. Moreover, as indicated in Note
1, the Company relies on Millipore for administrative, management, research and
other services. Accordingly, these combined financial statements do not
necessarily reflect the financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows of the Company had it been a stand-alone company.

1. Background and Basis of Presentation

Background

   On October 3, 2000, Millipore Corporation ("Millipore") announced its plan
to spin-off a separate company, initially named Millipore MicroElectronics,
Inc. and subsequently renamed Mykrolis Corporation (the "Company"), comprised
of Millipore's microelectronics business which serves the semiconductor
industry with products needed to manufacture semiconductor devices. On October
16, 2000, the Company was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Millipore. On October 17, 2000, 10,000 shares of the Company's $.01 par
value common stock were authorized, issued and outstanding and were owned by
Millipore. This new legal entity is presented on a combined basis with the
financial position and results of operations of the businesses contributed
pursuant to the Master Separation and Distribution Agreement (the "Separation
Agreement"). Separate financial statements have not been presented for this
entity because it had immaterial assets and liabilities and no results of
operations prior to the separation from Millipore on March 31, 2001.

   The Company anticipates that, subject to market conditions, it will make an
initial public offering (the "Offering") in the quarter ending September 30,
2001 for less than 20% of its common shares. On July 12, 2001, the Company
effected a recapitalization in the form of a stock split. The Board of
Directors declared a 3,250-for-1 stock split. As a result of this stock split,
common stock issued and outstanding increased to 32,500,000 shares. The stock
split has been reflected for all periods presented. Millipore has also
announced that it intends to distribute its remaining shares of the Company to
the Millipore shareholders through a tax-free dividend approximately six months
after the Offering (the "Distribution"). On June 18, 2001, Millipore received a
private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the Distribution
will be tax-free to Millipore shareholders.

   On March 28, 2001, Millipore and the Company entered into the Separation
Agreement under which Millipore transferred to the Company (the "Separation"),
effective as of March 31, 2001, substantially all of the assets and liabilities
associated with the microelectronics business, except for certain pension and
post-retirement liabilities that will be transferred at the Distribution. At
the Separation date, the Company entered into a Separation Note agreement with
Millipore, as described below. In addition, Millipore provided the Company with
a line of credit pursuant to the Separation Revolving Credit Agreement to
support its cash requirements between the Separation date and the consummation
of the Offering.

   The amount of the Separation Note is contingent upon the amount of the
Offering proceeds, the amount owed by the Company under the Separation
Revolving Credit Agreement and the amount of Offering proceeds that the Company
will retain to fund its operations. The amount of the Separation Note will be
determined shortly before the Offering. From the net proceeds of the Offering,
the Company will pay to Millipore any outstanding balances under the Separation
Revolving Credit Agreement and will repay the Separation Note.

   In addition, as it was impractical in some jurisdictions to transfer certain
account balances to different legal entities at the Separation date, Millipore
retained certain of the Company's accounts payable and accounts receivable
balances and the Company assumed certain of Millipore's accounts payable and
accounts receivable balances. The net amount due to, or from, Millipore related
to these balances retained by Millipore or assumed by the Company is reflected
as a receivable from, or a payable to, Millipore under the Separation Revolving
Credit Agreement as of the Separation date. The payment of these payables and
the collection of these

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)

receivables will be settled through the Separation Revolving Credit Agreement
if and when they occur. The Company and Millipore each remain responsible for
the payment of their respective accounts payable and the collection of their
respective accounts receivable.

   In March 2001, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to
increase the authorized shares of common stock to 250,000,000 and to authorize
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $.01 par value per share.


Basis of Presentation

   The combined financial statements include the assets, liabilities, operating
results and cash flows of the businesses constituting the Company that were
contributed as part of the Separation and have been prepared using Millipore's
historical bases in the assets and liabilities and the historical results of
operations of the Company. Management believes the assumptions underlying the
combined financial statements are reasonable. However, the combined financial
information included herein may not necessarily reflect the combined financial
position, operating results, changes in invested equity and cash flows of the
Company in the future or what they would have been had the Company been a
separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Because a direct
ownership relationship did not exist among all the various units comprising the
Company, Millipore's net investment in the Company is shown in lieu of
stockholders' equity in the combined financial statements. Changes in
Millipore's net investment represent Millipore's transfer of its net investment
in the Company, after giving effect to the net earnings of the Company plus net
cash transfers to Millipore and other transfers from Millipore. In connection
with the separation from Millipore, the Company began accumulating earnings on
April 1, 2001.

   Millipore uses a centralized approach to cash management and the financing
of its operations. Cash deposits from the Company were transferred to Millipore
on a regular basis and netted against Millipore's net investment. As a result,
none of Millipore's cash, cash equivalents or debt at the Millipore level have
been allocated to the Company in the combined financial statements. Changes in
invested equity represent the net earnings of the Company plus net cash
transfers to or from Millipore.

   The combined financial statements include allocations of certain Millipore
corporate expenses, including centralized research and development, legal,
accounting, employee benefits, officers' salaries, facilities, insurance,
information technology services, distribution, treasury and other Millipore
corporate and infrastructure costs. As more fully described in Note 14, the
expense allocations have been determined on a basis that Millipore and the

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Combination

   The combined financial statements include the accounts of the Company.
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in
affiliated companies that are 20%-50% owned entities are accounted for under
the equity method of accounting.

Use of Estimates

   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and
expenses during the period reported. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed
periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they
are determined to be necessary. These estimates include an allocation of costs
by Millipore, assessing the collectability of accounts receivable, the use and
recoverability of inventory, the realization of deferred tax assets, employee
benefits and useful lives for amortization periods of tangible and intangible
assets, among others. The markets for the Company's products are characterized
by intense competition, rapid technological development, evolving standards,
short product life cycles and price erosion, all of which could impact the
future realizability of the Company's assets. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

Translation of Foreign Currencies

   Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign operations for which the
local currency is the functional currency, are translated into U.S. dollars at
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are
translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the year and
elements of invested equity are translated at historical rates. Foreign
currency translation gains and losses related to net assets of such operations
are reported separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in invested equity. The aggregate transaction gains and losses
are included in the combined statements of operations as a component of other
expense, net.

Inventories

   The Company values its inventories at lower of cost or market on a first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

   Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense while the costs of significant
improvements, which extend the life of the underlying asset, are capitalized.
Assets are depreciated primarily using straight-line methods. Upon retirement
or sale, the cost of assets disposed and the related accumulated depreciation
are eliminated and related gains or losses are reflected in income.

   The estimated useful lives of the Company's depreciable assets are as
follows:

<TABLE>
      <S>                                       <C>

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


Goodwill and Other Intangibles

   Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is amortized on a
straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of 20 years. Other intangible
assets consist primarily of patents, acquired technology, trade names and
licenses. These assets are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods ranging from 3 to 12 years. Goodwill and certain other
intangible assets resulted from the Company's acquisition of Tylan General,
Inc. in January 1997.

   On a periodic basis the value of the intangible assets is reviewed to
determine if an impairment has taken place due to changed business conditions
or technological obsolescence. When such events occur, the Company compares the
carrying amount of the assets to undiscounted expected future cash flows. The
amount of such impairment if any, is computed by comparing the discounted
future cash flows associated with the underlying intangible asset to the
current net book value. If impairment exists, the net book value of the
intangible asset is reduced accordingly.

Income Taxes

   Historically, the Company's results of operations have been included in
Millipore's consolidated income tax returns. The provision (benefit) for income
taxes in the Company's combined statements of operations has been calculated on
a separate tax return basis. However, Millipore managed its tax position for
the benefit of its entire portfolio of businesses and its tax strategies are
not necessarily reflective of the tax strategies that the Company would have
followed or will follow as a separate stand-alone company.

   The asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and
liabilities. The Company provides a valuation allowance against net deferred
tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that
some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Revenue Recognition

   Net sales consist of revenue primarily from sales of products net of trade
discounts and allowances. Revenue from sales of products is recognized when
contractual obligations have been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been
transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is
reasonably assured. Revenue from services is recognized when the services are
provided.

Research and Development Costs

   Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Other Income (Expense)

   Other income (expense) includes foreign currency transaction exchange gains
and losses as well as gains and losses on investments in 20%-50% owned entities
accounted for under the equity method. On a periodic basis, the value of equity
method and other investments is reviewed to determine if an impairment has
taken place.

Earnings Per Share

   As discussed in Note 1, "Background and Basis of Presentation," the Company
effected a stock split resulting in 32,500,000 common shares outstanding. Basic
and diluted earnings (loss) per share have been computed by dividing the net
income (loss) for each period presented by the 32,500,000 common shares
outstanding subsequent to completion of the recapitalization.

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


   Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share have been
computed by dividing net income (loss) for each period by the sum of the
32,500,000 common shares outstanding as part of recapitalization plus 1,801,989
shares of the total 7,000,000 shares to be issued in the offering, which
represents the shares attributable to the amount of net proceeds that will be
used to repay amounts owed to Millipore under the separation revolving credit
agreement and the separation note.

Concentration of Credit Risk

   Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does
not require collateral.

Warranty Costs

   The Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time of the product
sale.

Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

   Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and the change in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company's accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) shown on the combined balance sheet consists solely
of foreign currency translation adjustments which are not adjusted for income
taxes since they relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. operations.

3. Restructuring Programs and Other Charges

   2001 Restructuring Program and Other Charges (unaudited)

   During the first quarter of 2001, the Company recorded restructuring and
other charges of $12,556 in connection with the Company's separation from
Millipore to improve the Company's manufacturing asset utilization and resize
the Company's overall cost structure. The restructuring and other charges
included $11,260 of employee severance costs, a $946 write-off of equipment and
leasehold improvements and $350 of lease cancellation costs. Key initiatives of
the restructuring program included:

  .  Consolidating manufacturing operations to eliminate redundant
     manufacturing processes. The Company is in the process of relocating the
     operations of two of its manufacturing facilities in the United States
     and downsizing its manufacturing facility in England. The consolidation
     of the Company's manufacturing operations is expected to be completed in
     the first quarter of 2002. The Company also anticipates opening a new
     manufacturing facility outside the United States in late 2001 or early
     2002.

  .  Realigning the Company's European organizational structure to focus on
     the Company's operating business units, thereby consolidating the
     Company's sales and administrative activities into fewer locations that
     are closer to the Company's customer base. The Company expects to
     complete this transition during 2001.

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


  .  Reducing the Company's administrative and management infrastructure
     costs in Asia. These cost reductions are expected to result in lower
     overhead for administrative and management infrastructure in Asia and
     will be achieved through reduced facility costs and administrative
     positions during 2001.

  .  Reducing the Company's workforce in the U.S. in order to address
     anticipated changes in the demand for the Company's products due to the
     current semiconductor industry downturn.

   The restructuring initiatives resulted in the elimination of 205 positions
worldwide. Notification to employees was completed in the first quarter of
2001, however a number of these employees will continue in their existing
positions through the first quarter of 2002 with their related salary costs
charged to operations as incurred. In the first quarter of 2001, approximately
$6,084 of restructuring reserve, consisting primarily of severance and
associated benefits for 77 employees, was utilized. At March 31, 2001,
approximately $6,472 of restructuring costs remained accrued and the Company
believes that such amounts will be substantially paid by the end of the first
quarter of 2002.

   The following is a summary of the 2001 Restructuring Program and Other
Charges reserve balances at March 31, 2001:

   1998 Restructuring Program and Provision for Excess Inventory

   In the second quarter of 1998, Millipore announced a restructuring program.
The program included the consolidation of certain manufacturing operations and
discontinuance of non-strategic product lines. In the third quarter of 1998,
the Company recorded an expense associated with these activities of $8,346
including a restructuring charge of $7,120, a $847 charge against cost of sales
for inventory obsolescence and $379 for fixed asset write-offs. The non-
strategic product lines consisted of semiconductor fab monitoring and control
software and various filtration devices. The $7,120 restructuring charge
included $5,009 of employee severance costs, $1,350 for the write-off of
intangible assets including those associated with the discontinued product
lines, consisting of both unpatented completed technology and tradenames as
well as with termination of certain rights under a technology development
collaboration, and $761 of supply contract termination costs.

   During the third quarters of 1999 and 2000, the Company reevaluated the
accrual for the restructuring program and reversed $1,221 and $320,
respectively, of the remaining balance. The reversals reflected lower estimates
for severance cost attributed to higher levels of attrition than originally
anticipated and affected employees filling open positions at Millipore that
resulted from improved business conditions.

   The restructuring initiatives combined with the 1998 consolidation of the
Company's plants resulted in the elimination of 460 positions worldwide (340
positions in manufacturing operations, 80 in selling, general and
administrative positions and 40 in research and development). Notification to
employees was completed in 1998, although a small number of the affected
employees continued working in their existing positions through 1999 with their
related salary costs charged to operations as incurred. A total of 440
employees left the Company pursuant to this initiative.

7. Leases

   Operating lease agreements cover sales offices, manufacturing and warehouse
space. These leases have expiration dates through 2008. Certain land and
building leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to ten
years and purchase options at fair market value. Under the lease terms relating
to the Company's Bedford, Massachusetts headquarters facility, the Company has
an option to purchase the facility at fair market value between June 2005 and
November 2005, the expiration date of the lease, and the lessor has the option
to sell the facility to the Company at 90% of the then current fair market
value prior to November 2005. Rental expense was $6,775 in 2000, $7,469 in
1999, and $6,161 in 1998. At December 31, 2000, future minimum rents payable
under noncancelable leases with initial terms exceeding one year were as
follows:

8. Stock Plans

Employees' Stock Purchase Plan

   During 2000, 1999 and in prior years, employees of the Company were eligible
to participate in the Millipore Employees' Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). The
ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase Millipore stock at 85% of the lesser
of the fair market value of the common stock on June 1, the beginning of the
plan year, or the closing price at the end of each subsequent quarter. Each
employee may purchase up to 10% (up to a maximum of $25,000) of eligible
compensation. The Company intends to establish a similar plan after the
Offering.

Stock Incentive Plan

   During 2000, 1999 and in prior years, certain employees of the Company were
granted stock options and restricted stock under Millipore's stock-based
compensation plan. The Millipore 1999 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Millipore
Plan") provides for the issuance of stock options and restricted stock to key
employees as incentive compensation. The exercise price of a stock option is
equal to the fair market value of Millipore's common stock on the date the
option is granted and its term is generally ten years and vests over four
years. The Company intends to establish its own employee stock incentive plans
at the time of the Offering. Unvested stock options outstanding under the
Millipore Plan will be converted to stock options of the Company at the
Distribution. The conversion of Millipore stock options into the Company stock
options will be done in such a manner that (1) the aggregate intrinsic value of
the options immediately before and after the exchange are the same, (2) the
ratio of the exercise price per option to the market value per option is not
reduced, and (3) the vesting provisions and option period of the replacement
Company options are the same as the original vesting terms and option period of
the Millipore options. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's employees held
816,788 unvested Millipore stock options including those options held by
certain Millipore corporate management employees who became employees of the
Company on the Separation date.

   The Millipore Plan also provides that the restricted stock, which is awarded
to key members of senior management at no cost to them, cannot be sold,
assigned, transferred or pledged during a restriction period which is normally
four years but in some cases may be less. In most instances, shares are subject
to forfeiture should employment terminate during the restriction period. The
restricted stock is recorded at its fair market value on the award date and the
related deferred compensation is amortized to selling, general and
administrative expenses over the restriction period. The allocated portion of
compensation expense attributable to the Company's employees was $403 in 1998,
$571 in 1999 and $1,177 in 2000. At December 31, 2000, the Company's employees
held 55,500 shares of restricted stock and the related total deferred
compensation included in the combined statements of changes in invested equity
and total comprehensive income (loss) was $730. It is anticipated that all of
the restricted shares of Millipore held by the Company's employees will vest as
of the Distribution. This modification may result in an additional compensation
charge in the period of the acceleration based on the then current market value
of Millipore stock.

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


Pro forma information

   The Company applies the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," in
accounting for stock options granted to employees. Pro forma net earnings
information as required by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," has been determined as if Millipore had accounted for employee
stock options granted to the Company employees under SFAS No. 123's fair value
method. The fair value of these options was estimated at grant date using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: expected life of five years in 1998, 1999 and 2000; dividend rate
of $0.53, $0.44 and $0.44 in 1998, 1999 and 2000, respectively; risk-free
interest rates of 4.5% in 1998, 6.2% in 1999 and 5.3% in 2000; and volatility
of 30% in 1998, 35% in 1999 and 45% in 2000.

   The pro forma expense amounts assume that the fair value assigned to the
option grants was amortized over the vesting period of the options, which is
generally four years, while the fair value assigned to grants under the stock
purchase plan is recognized in full at the date of grant. The pro forma effect
of recognizing compensation expense in accordance with SFAS No. 123 would have
been to reduce the Company's reported net earnings by $893 in 1998, $1,038 in
1999 and $1,587 in 2000.

9. Employee Retirement Plans

   At the Distribution date, the Company will assume responsibility for certain
of the pension benefits and the other post-retirement benefits for employees
whose last work assignment prior to the Distribution was with the Company.
These employees are collectively referred to as "Mykrolis Employees." The
pension liabilities that are assumed by the Company and the liabilities related
to the other post-retirement benefits as well as the related expenses have been
reflected in these financial statements for all years presented.

   The U.S. employees of the Company participate in Millipore's non-
contributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers substantially all U.S.
employees. The Mykrolis Employees will maintain their vested and unvested
rights in the Millipore pension plans after the Separation date. However, the
liabilities related to these rights are not assumed by the Company and
therefore are not reflected in the combined balance sheets of the Company.
Millipore allocates net periodic pension costs related to Mykrolis Employees
that participate in this plan to the Company. No contribution was required for
1998, 1999 or 2000 as the plan was adequately funded.

Participation and Savings Plan

   All U.S. employees of the Company are covered under the Millipore
Corporation Employees' Participation and Savings Plan (the "Participation and
Savings Plan"), maintained for the benefit of all U.S. employees, which
combines both a defined contribution plan (the "Participation Plan") and an
employee savings plan (the "Savings Plan"). Contributions to the Participation
Plan are allocated among the U.S. employees of the Company who have completed
at least two years of continuous service on the basis of the compensation they
received during the year for which the contribution is made. The Savings Plan
allows employees to make certain tax-deferred voluntary contributions, which
Millipore matches after one year of service with a 25% contribution (50%
contribution for employees with ten or more years of service). Total expense
under the Participation and Savings Plan was $3,208 in 1998, $2,395 in 1999 and
$2,972 in 2000. As of the Separation date, the Company intends to establish its
own employee savings plan.

Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan for Key Salaried Employees

   Millipore offers a Supplemental Savings and Retirement Plan for Key Salaried
Employees (the "Supplemental Plan") to certain senior executives that allows
certain salary deferral benefits that would otherwise be lost by reason of
restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code limiting the amount of
compensation which may be deferred under tax-qualified plans. The liabilities
related to these rights will be assumed by the Company and are therefore
reflected in the combined balance sheets. Total expense under the Supplemental
Plan was $127 in 1998, $568 in 1999 and $190 in 2000. As of the Separation
date, the Company intends to establish a similar plan of its own.

Japan Retirement and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

   Substantially all the Company's U.S. employees are covered under several
unfunded defined benefit post-retirement plans, which are sponsored by
Millipore. The plans provide medical and life insurance benefits and are,
depending on the plan, either contributory or non-contributory. The employees
of the Company's subsidiary in Japan ("Nihon Mykrolis") are covered in a
defined benefit pension plan.

   The tables below set forth the estimated net periodic cost and funded status
of the Nihon Mykrolis Pension Plan and the U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plan.

11. Significant Customers and Concentration of Risk

   Historically, the Company has relied on a limited number of customers for a
substantial portion of its net sales. During the fiscal years ended December
31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 revenues from one customer represented 11%, 13% and
18%, respectively of total net sales. Accounts receivable for this customer was
approximately $7.0 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 1999 and 2000,
respectively. There were no other customers that accounted for more than 10% of
revenues or accounts receivable during any of these periods.

12. Related Party Transaction

   In 1999, Millipore made a loan to an executive officer of the Company, which
is collateralized by real estate held by the executive. The loan is interest
free until December 2002 and thereafter will bear interest at the prime rate
then prevailing. The loan will become due upon the first to occur of (a) the
sale of the pledged property, (b) March 2003 or (c) the termination of the
executive's employment.

   During the first quarter of 2001, the officer resigned and Millipore agreed
to withhold its right to immediate repayment of the loan until the first to
occur of the sale of the property or August 14, 2001. The loan receivable of
$450 is included in other assets in the combined balance sheets at December 31,
1999 and 2000 and other current assets at March 31, 2001 (unaudited).

13. Legal Proceedings

   In July 2000, Kurabo Industries Ltd. sued the Company in the Osaka District
Court, Osaka, Japan. This suit alleges that certain filter cartridges
manufactured in Japan by a subsidiary of the Company, Nihon Mykrolis KK
("NMKK") infringes a Japanese patent held by the plaintiff. The suit seeks
$11,000 in damages and an injunction against the future use of these filter
cartridges. NMKK has responded to this suit by denying any infringement. The
Company does not expect this suit to have a material adverse impact on its
financial position or results of operations.

   In 1998, a charge of $3,666 was recorded for the settlement of a patent
lawsuit with Mott Metallurgical Corporation in which each party claimed
infringement of one of its patents by the other. The parties also agreed to
cross license the two patents at issue.

   The Company is also subject to a number of other claims and legal
proceedings which, in the opinion of the Company's management, are incidental
to the Company's normal business operations. In the opinion of the Company,
although final settlement of these suits and claims may impact the Company's
financial statements in a particular period, they will not, in the aggregate,
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

14. Transactions with Millipore

   For years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 (unaudited), the Company purchased products from
Millipore for inclusion in its products sold to third parties totaling $4.3
million, $4.0 million, $4.0 million, $0.9 million and $1.0 million,
respectively. Products sold to Millipore were not material for the periods
presented.

   The Company's costs and expenses include allocations from Millipore for
centralized research and development, legal, accounting, employee benefits,
officers' salaries, facilities, insurance, information technology services,
distribution, treasury and other Millipore corporate and infrastructure costs.
These allocations have been determined on bases that Millipore and the Company
considered to be a reasonable assessment of the utilization of services
provided or the benefit received by the Company. The allocation methods include
relative sales, headcount, square footage and specific identification.
Allocated costs included in the accompanying combined statements of operations
are as follows:

Separation Agreements

   For purposes of governing certain of the ongoing relationships between the
Company and Millipore at and after the Separation and to provide for an orderly
transition, the Company and Millipore entered into various agreements at the
Separation date. A brief description of each of the agreements follows.

Master Separation and Distribution Agreement

   The separation agreement contains the key provisions relating to the
Separation, the Company's initial funding, initial public offering and the
Distribution. The agreement lists the documents and items that the parties
delivered in order to accomplish the transfer of assets and liabilities from
Millipore to the Company, effective on the Separation date. The agreement also
contains conditions that must occur prior to the Offering and the Distribution.
The parties also entered into ongoing covenants that survive the transactions,
including covenants to establish interim service level agreements, exchange
information, notify each other of changes in their accounting principles and
resolve disputes in particular ways.

General Assignment and Assumption Agreement

   The General Assignment and Assumption Agreement identifies the assets that
Millipore transferred to the Company and the liabilities that the Company
assumed from Millipore in the Separation. In general, the assets transferred
and the liabilities assumed are those that appear on the combined balance
sheet, after adjustment for certain assets and liabilities that were retained
by Millipore and for activity that occurs between the balance sheet date and
the Separation.

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


Separation Revolving Credit Agreement and Separation Note

   The Separation Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") provides
for Millipore to lend the Company funds between the Separation date and the
date of the Offering in order to satisfy working capital needs. Under the
Credit Agreement, the Company may borrow up to $100,000 in multiples of $100,
from Millipore at any time or from time to time prior to the repayment date.
All amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement must be repaid on the repayment
date, which is the earlier of fifteen days following the closing of the
Offering or December 31, 2002. Interest on outstanding borrowings will not
accrue from the date of borrowing to the repayment date. Interest will accrue
on borrowed amounts from the repayment date through the date of actual payment
at the per annum rate of twelve-month LIBOR plus 1.5%.

   The Separation Note provides for a payment by the Company to Millipore out
of the proceeds from the Offering. The amount of the Separation Note is
contingent upon the amount of the Offering proceeds and will be determined
shortly before the Offering. Pursuant to the terms of the Separation Note, the
Company must pay Millipore, on the fifteenth day following the consummation of
the Offering, an amount equal to net proceeds received by the Company in the
Offering after payment of all associated expenses including the underwriters'
discount, minus the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement, less a
certain amount of funds which will be retained by the Company to fund
operations. The Separation Note does not bear interest from the Separation date
through the repayment date. Thereafter, to the extent the note remains unpaid,
the Separation Note will bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the base
rate, as defined in the separation note, plus 1.5%.

Master Transitional Services Agreement
   The Master Transitional Services Agreement governs the terms and conditions
upon which interim transitional services will be provided to each of the
Company and Millipore. The nature of the services include facilities,
engineering, information technology, equipment usage, financial accounting,
distribution and warehousing and human resources administration. The Company
and Millipore will also provide each other additional services as the Company
and Millipore may identify from time to time after the Separation. Specific
charges for such services are generally intended to allow the company providing
the service to recover direct costs plus expenses, without profit.

Membrane Manufacture and Supply Agreement
   The Membrane Manufacture and Supply Agreement enables the Company to
manufacture certain membranes in the same production areas and with the same
processes as were available to the Company prior to the Separation for both its
own use and sale. Under the agreement, Millipore leases this space and
manufacturing equipment to the Company for five years. This agreement also
provides for the supply of certain membranes manufactured by either the Company
or Millipore to the other party at costs appropriate to that of a third party
contract manufacturer.

Product Distribution Agreement
   The Company and Millipore have historically sold products of the other
company within their respective fields of use. The Product Distribution
Agreement allows each company to purchase products from the other company at
prices representing discounts off published list prices. The Company's combined
statements of operations include revenue from Millipore products covered under
this agreement was $4.3 million, $4.0 million, $4.0 million, $0.9 million and
$1.0 million for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended March

                 (In thousands except share and per share data)


Employee Matters Agreement
   The Employee Matters Agreement outlines how Millipore and the Company
allocate responsibility for and liability related to the employment of those
employees of Millipore who became the Company's employees. The agreement also
contains provisions describing the Company's benefit and equity plans. On or
before the Distribution, the Company expects to establish employee benefit
plans comparable to those of Millipore for its active, inactive and former
employees. However, in certain cases, certain of its employees will continue to
participate in the Millipore benefit plans. The transfer to the Company of
employees at certain of Millipore's international operations, and of certain
pension and employee benefit plans, may not take place until the Company
receives consents or approvals or has satisfied other applicable requirements.

Contract Manufacturing Agreements
   The Millipore Contract Manufacturing Agreement provides for Millipore to
manufacture certain products for resale by the Company at prices subject to
annual increases equal to actual increases in Millipore's cost to manufacture
these products. There are no minimum or maximum purchase requirements, subject
to binding three-month forecasts that may increase or decrease by 25% without
penalty. The Company may not resell these products into Millipore's
biopharmaceutical business. This agreement has a term of five years, unless
terminated by the Company on sixty days prior written notice. The Company has
also agreed to manufacture parts for Millipore for use in Millipore's products
on substantially similar terms pursuant to the Mykrolis Contract Manufacturing
Agreement.

Plan of Reorganization of Operations Outside of the U.S.

   This plan sets forth the steps and actions to be taken in order to separate
the Company's business conducted outside of the U.S. from the bioscience
businesses conducted outside the U.S. and being retained by Millipore. It
details the legal entity structure for the Company and the actions being taken
to transfer employees, assets and operations to these legal entities in
compliance with local laws and regulations.

Tax Sharing Agreement

   The Company and Millipore entered into a Tax Sharing Agreement, which will
govern the Company's and Millipore's respective rights, responsibilities and
obligations after the Distribution with respect to taxes for the periods ending
on or before the Distribution. In addition, the Tax Sharing Agreement will
address the allocation of liability for taxes that are incurred as a result of
the restructuring activities undertaken to implement the Separation. If the
Distribution fails to qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of
the Internal Revenue Code because of the acquisition of the Company's stock or
assets, or some other actions of the Company, then the Company will be solely
liable for any resulting corporate taxes. Generally, Millipore indemnifies the
Company for any tax liability resulting from the pre-separation adjustments due
to an amended return, claim for refund or a tax audit.

Intellectual Property Agreements

   Under the intellectual property agreements, Millipore transferred to the
Company its rights in specified patents, specified trademarks and other
intellectual property related to the Company's current business and research
and development efforts. Millipore and the Company will each license the other
under selected patents and other intellectual property the right to use those
patents and other intellectual property in their respective businesses, subject
to field of use restrictions. Millipore and the Company will each have an
option, exercisable within the first five years of the agreements, to be
licensed under specified patents of the other issued on patent applications
with effective filing dates before the Separation date, subject to field of use
restrictions and the payment of a royalty. The Company was also assigned know-
how that is used in the manufacture of its products as of the Separation date.
The agreements include certain rights to sublicense for both parties. The
Company is licensed to use the Millipore trademark for up to three years with
certain field of use limitations.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

   Mykrolis is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Section
145 ("Section 145") of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (the "General Corporation Law"),
inter alia, provides that a Delaware corporation may indemnify any persons who
were, are or are threatened to be made, parties to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of such corporation),
by reason of the fact that such person is or was an officer, director, employee
or agent of such corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
enterprise. The indemnity may include expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding,
provided such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the corporation's best interests and, with respect
to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that
his conduct was illegal.

   Section 145 further authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
corporation would otherwise have the power to indemnify him under Section 145.

   The registrant's restated certificate of incorporation provides that the
registrant's directors shall not be liable to the registrant or its
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director,
except to the extent that the exculpation from liabilities is not permitted
under the General Corporation Law as in effect at the time such liability is
determined. The registrant's restated certificate of incorporation provides
that the registrant shall indemnify its directors to the full extent permitted
by the laws of the State of Delaware.

   All of Mykrolis' directors and officers will be covered by insurance
policies maintained by Mykrolis against specified liabilities for actions taken
in their capacities as such, including liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. In addition, prior to the consummation of this offering,
Mykrolis will enter into

                                      II-1
<PAGE>

indemnification agreements with each of its directors and executive officers
that provide for indemnification and expense advancement to the fullest extent
permitted under the General Corporation Law.

   The master separation and distribution agreement by and between us and
Millipore provides for indemnification by us of Millipore and its directors,
officers and employees for some liabilities, including liabilities under the
Securities Act.

Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

   We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware under the name
Millipore MicroElectronics, Inc. on October 16, 2000 and changed our name to
Mykrolis Corporation on March 27, 2001. On October 17, 2000, we issued 10,000
shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share, to Millipore in
consideration of a nominal capital contribution by Millipore. That issuance was
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant
to Section 4(2) thereof because such issuance did not involve any public
offering of securities.

   All other schedules for which provision is made in the applicable accounting
regulations of the Commission are not required under the related instructions,
are inapplicable or not material, or the information called for thereby is
otherwise included in the financial statements and therefore has been omitted.

Item 17. Undertakings.

   The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters
at the closing specified in the underwriting agreement, certificates in such
denominations and registered in such manner as requested by the underwriters to
permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.

   The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:

   (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of
1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this
Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of
prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h)
under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this Registration
Statement as of the time it was declared effective.

   (2) For the purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act
of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall
be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the
Registrant pursuant to the provisions described under "Item 14--Indemnification
of Directors and Officers" above, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised
that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification
against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses
incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant
in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the
matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of
appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed
by the final adjudication of such issue.
