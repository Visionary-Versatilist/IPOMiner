 ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS 
Financial Statement Presentation  This
prospectus includes certain historical consolidated financial and other data for Omaha Topco Ltd., an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability (Omaha Topco). Omaha Topco will be considered our
predecessor for financial reporting purposes. Omaha Topco was formed by Blackstone (as defined below) primarily as a vehicle to finance the acquisition in July 2014 of the entire equity interest in Pinafore Holdings B.V. for $5.4 billion (the
Acquisition) by investment funds managed by Blackstone. Following the Acquisition, Pinafore Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries (the Pre-Acquisition Predecessor) is the predecessor to the group comprised of Omaha Topco and its
subsidiaries (the Post-Acquisition Predecessor). The last day of the fiscal year for the Pre-Acquisition Predecessors annual consolidated financial statements is December 31. Comparative information is presented for the
Pre-Acquisition Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2014 through July 2, 2014 (Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014). 
The last day of the fiscal year for the Post-Acquisition Predecessors annual consolidated financial statements is the Saturday nearest
December 31. Accordingly, the Post-Acquisition Predecessors consolidated financial statements are presented for the periods from January 3, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (Fiscal 2016), January 4, 2015 to
January 2, 2016 (Fiscal 2015) and July 3, 2014 to January 3, 2015 (Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014). The combination of the Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 and Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 periods is
referred to as Full Year 2014.  The last day of the fiscal quarters for our interim consolidated financial statements is the
Saturday nearest March 31, June 30 and September 30, for the fiscal first quarter, second quarter and third quarter, respectively. This prospectus contains unaudited Post-Acquisition Predecessor condensed consolidated financial
statements that present the results of Post-Acquisition Predecessors operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and the nine months ended October 1, 2016. 
Gates Industrial Corporation plc will be the financial reporting entity following this offering. Prior to the completion of this offering, we
will undertake certain reorganization transactions (the pre-IPO reorganization transactions) so that Gates Industrial Corporation plc will indirectly own all equity interests in Omaha Topco and will become the holding company of our
business. In connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions, our Sponsor and the other equity owners of Omaha Topco will receive depositary receipts representing ordinary shares in Gates Industrial Corporation plc in consideration for their
equity in Omaha Topco, at a ratio of 0.76293 of our ordinary shares for each outstanding ordinary share of Omaha Topco. See SummaryOur Organizational Structure. The reorganization will be accounted for as a transaction between
entities under common control and the net assets will be recorded at the historical cost basis when the entities are contributed into Gates Industrial Corporation plc. Other than the inception balance sheet, the financial statements of Gates
Industrial Corporation plc have not been included in this prospectus as it is a newly organized entity, has no significant business transactions or activities to date, has no capitalization, and had no assets or liabilities during the periods
presented in this prospectus.   Certain monetary amounts, percentages and other figures included elsewhere in this prospectus have
been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables or charts may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as
applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.

 SUMMARY 
This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information you should consider
before investing in our ordinary shares. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, including the section entitled Risk Factors and the financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus,
before you decide to invest in our ordinary shares.  Gates Overview 
We are a global manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of
products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment (first-fit) manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications
across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and
utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. We sell
our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since
Gates founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness
of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio
represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer,
manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate. 
During Fiscal 2016, we generated $2,747.0 million in net sales to over 8,000 customers in 128 countries, our net income was $84.3 million
and our Adjusted EBITDA was $594.9 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from Fiscal 2015. During Fiscal 2015, we generated $2,745.1 million in net sales, our net income was $50.9 million and our
Adjusted EBITDA was $547.2 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our net sales increased 8.7% to $2,259.9 million compared to $2,079.3 million for the nine months ended
October 1, 2016, our net income was $52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $69.0 million in the prior year period, and our Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.0% to $496.1 million, compared to $447.0 million
in the prior year period, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.0%, a 50 basis point increase compared to the prior year period. As of September 30, 2017, our total indebtedness was approximately $3,916.1 million, or $3,236.3 million on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom. For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally

  Our History and Recent Developments 
Gates was founded in 1911 by Charles C. Gates and since then has been recognized as an innovator in the power transmission and fluid power
markets. Gates operated as a family-owned company until 1996, when it was acquired by Tomkins plc, a broad, industrial conglomerate based in the United Kingdom. In 2010, Tomkins was acquired by Onex Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board, who proceeded to divest the individual Tomkins companies. Gates was acquired by funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. in July 2014. 
In 2015, Gates established a new executive leadership team with the appointment of Ivo Jurek as Chief Executive Officer and David Naemura as
Chief Financial Officer. Under the new leadership team, investments have been made to shift the organization from a regional model to a global product-line model by building out a global product-line management function and globalizing our
engineering teams into product-line focused groups. This shift has allowed us to develop global, market-facing product strategies and product roadmaps to better align and focus our resources on executing our growth initiatives. We have continued to
invest in, upgrade and expand our regionally-based commercial teams. During this time we also implemented a global functional structure across our human resources, information technology, finance, legal, research and development
(R&D) and operations teams. These global functional teams are driving consistency of best-practice processes across each function, improving our performance and efficiency. These initiatives fall under the Gates Operating System
(GOS), a philosophy of continuous improvement and standardized best practices which we have deployed across our organization. The implementation of this system has resulted in increased productivity, reduced costs and contributed to
margin improvements since 2014.   We have developed an active acquisition pipeline and the organizational capability to integrate
acquired companies. In 2017 we closed two transactions, Techflow Flexibles in the United Kingdom and Atlas Hydraulics in North America, both focused on expanding our presence in industrial markets with new products, capabilities, capacity and
geographic reach. We believe that our global functional excellence, product-line focus and strong commercial teams provide a solid foundation to deliver on our continuous improvement and organic growth initiatives, supplemented by our ability to
execute on inorganic opportunities.

 Our Solutions 
We operate our business on a product-line basis through our two reporting segmentsPower Transmission and Fluid
Powerand participate in a diverse set of applications across numerous industrial end markets, as well as many consumer markets. In these markets, widely recognized macro trends such as population growth, urbanization, infrastructure build
out, industrial automation and increased energy efficiency, are expected to support long-term demand for our products. Our strengths, combined with the inherent value propositions our products deliver, position us well to serve our customers in
these markets.  Our highly engineered power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment,
process or system in which they are components, creating a dynamic where the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is high relative to the cost of our products. For example, on an agricultural harvester, we estimate that the cost of system
downtime during harvest season is approximately $5,300 per hour, whereas the cost of a replacement hydraulic hose assembly is approximately $300. Industrial synchronous drives, which can cost an end user as little as $75, are widely used to power
key systems in industrial facilities. Failure of these drives can stop production and result in significant downtime costs. Because the cost of our products is low relative to the cost of downtime or equipment damage, our products are not only
replaced as a result of normal wear and tear, but also preemptively as part of ongoing maintenance to the broader system.   
  



      



  Power Transmission. Our Power Transmission solutions enable and control motion. They are used
in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives transfer power from an engine or motor to another part or system. Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist of either a synchronous belt or an
asynchronous belt (V-belt, CVT belt or Micro-V® belt) and related components (sprockets, pulleys, water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). Within our Power Transmission segment, we offer
solutions across the following key application platforms:   


 

 
Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, or on a grain elevator driving the lift auger. 
 


 

 
Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as a combine harvester or a road compactor, or in applications such as the brush head of a vacuum cleaner.

 Our Channels 
We sell our high-performance power transmission and fluid power products both as replacement components and as specified components on
original equipment to customers worldwide. For Fiscal 2016, approximately 64% of our net sales were generated from replacement markets and 36% from first-fit markets globally. Our mix of replacement sales to first-fit sales varies by region based on
our market strategy and the maturity of the equipment fleet and replacement channel. For example, in emerging markets such as China, our business is characterized by a higher first-fit presence, given the relatively underdeveloped replacement
channels and newer car parc. In China and East Asia, approximately 40% of our Fiscal 2016 net sales were generated from replacement markets. As these markets mature, we believe that our first-fit market presence will drive growth in our replacement
business. By contrast, in North America and Europe, where there are long-established replacement markets, approximately 73% and 68% of our Fiscal 2016 net sales, respectively, were derived from these higher-margin replacement channels. 
Replacement. The majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who primarily serve a large base of
installed equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle. Our ability to help replacement channel partners maximize revenue is core to our value proposition. These customers miss sales opportunities if a required product cannot be obtained
quickly, either from a catalog or on-hand inventory. We believe that our broad product portfolio, which consisted of approximately 370,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) in Fiscal 2016, constitutes the broadest range of power transmission
and fluid power products in the markets we serve. Our customers value the ability to easily access this broad product portfolio through our comprehensive range of application-based catalogs. Our product and catalog coverage, combined with our
quality and consistently high fill rates, make Gates a preferred supplier for over 6,000 customers in our replacement markets, where timely product availability is crucial. 
The total value proposition we provide to replacement channel customers extends beyond the breadth of our product portfolio and catalog
coverage, and the quality of our products. Our complementary suite of services, digital tools and other content enhances the value of our products to distributors, installers and end users of equipment containing our products. Our sales and
marketing organization offers customer training on product installation and early identification of wear-and-tear on components, which helps drive sales for our channel customers while mitigating the risk of equipment failure for end users. We have
a long history of focusing on customer engagement and training, driving product innovation and providing best-in-class inventory management and order fulfillment services. We believe that our ability to maintain a consistently high level of customer
satisfaction drives continued loyalty from our customer base.  First-Fit. Our first-fit customers demand high levels of
performance, quality and service, and expect that we continuously innovate. We work closely with our customers by providing application engineering expertise to assist them in selecting the right products for their applications. For example, in
industrial markets, we provide a variety of application engineering support that ranges from self-service design tools to field application engineers who act as design consultants on projects. In engine systems, we are one of the only suppliers
providing application engineering for cam drive and accessory drive applications, and completing all design and manufacturing of the system components in-house. Close interactions between our R&D organization and customer technical teams provide
important input into our innovation and product development processes and have resulted in many of our product innovations. We selectively participate in first-fit projects, focusing on opportunities where we
are able to differentiate with technology and innovative solutions. Whether or not we are a direct supplier to an equipment manufacturer, we still experience strong pull-through demand from end users who specifically request Gates-branded products
in the replacement market.

 Our Geographies 
Our products are sold in 128 countries across our four commercial regions: (1) the Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East &
Africa (EMEA); (3) Greater China (China); and (4) East Asia & India (East Asia). We have a long-standing presence in each of these regions, and our commercial teams have demonstrated a track
record of growing in emerging markets. These commercial capabilities are complemented by our global manufacturing footprint, which frequently allows us to manufacture products in close proximity to our customers. We have power transmission and fluid
power operations in each commercial region and typically manufacture products for both first-fit customers and replacement customers in the same factory, which provides improved factory loading and demand leveling, as well as optimization of capital
expenditures. Our in-region, for-region footprint and extensive distribution network provide us with a close-to-customer local mindset that enables rapid response for our customer base. This combination of capabilities
enhances our value proposition and strengthens our customer relationships.  Our Diverse Industries and End Markets 
We participate in many sectors of the industrial and consumer markets. Our products play essential roles in a diverse range of applications
across a wide variety of end markets ranging from harsh and hazardous industries such as agriculture, construction, manufacturing and energy, to everyday consumer applications such as printers, power washers, automatic doors and vacuum cleaners.
Virtually every form of transportation, ranging from trucks, buses and automobiles to personal mobility vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles, uses our products. We believe the large, diverse
and global nature of the markets we serve provides attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Based on market research data, as well as our own analysis, we believe that we have a total core addressable market opportunity of approximately $59
billion. Power Transmission accounts for approximately $30 billion of the total core addressable market opportunity, divided approximately among the following product categories: $1.8 billion in synchronous drives, $3.1 billion in asynchronous
drives, $7.5 billion in metals and $17.5 billion in other drive systems. Fluid Power represents approximately $29 billion of the total core addressable market opportunity, divided approximately among the following product categories: $11.2 billion
in hydraulics, $14.0 billion in engine hose and $3.5 billion in industrial hose.  We believe the end markets we serve benefit from
inherent growth provided by several attractive, secular long-term trends that create demand for the applications in which our products are used. Underlying all of the long-term trends is the growth of the worlds population, which is expected
to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. Along with population growth comes an increased demand for water and food, the production of which is expected to increase 59% by 2050. This increased level of food production is expected to drive a corresponding
increase in demand for both farming and food processing equipment. Related water demand will drive increased needs for water treatment facilities and pumping stations, all of which rely upon our products. 
This population growth and a growing middle-class in emerging markets also drive an increased infrastructure build-out, which requires more
construction equipment to build roads, bridges, rail systems and buildings. The worlds population also continues to urbanize, with 70% of people expected to live in cities by 2050, up from 50% today. Urbanization leads to more vertical
infrastructure, and, with more people living in high rise buildings, there will be an increased need for elevators and other vertical lift systems. These trends also positively impact the transportation markets our products are used in, ranging from
trucks, buses and automobiles to personal mobility vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters and bicycles. Additionally, we expect these trends to continue to generate increased demand for energy production over the long term. Oil and gas drilling and
refining, alternative energy generation and mining equipment all leverage Gates products.

 Industries across the globe are also continuously investing in automation and productivity
improvements. Energy efficiency, advanced technology and emerging economies are expected to continue to drive growth in the industrial automation market. As an example, new installations of industrial robots are forecast to grow at a 13% compound
annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2017 to 2019, while the demand for 3D printing technology is also expected to increase. Belt drives generally outperform other forms of mechanical power transmission, giving even more reason to choose a
belt drive versus alternatives in all of these applications.  Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity
and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. We believe we are well
positioned to outpace these indicators by leveraging our competitive strengths to penetrate underserved core markets.  Our Competitive
Strengths  Premier Recognized Brand 
We offer our products and services under the widely-recognized Gates brand across our broad end markets and geographies. Since 1911, Gates has
been recognized by distributors, installers, equipment manufacturers and end users as a premier name for power transmission and fluid power products, services and solutions. We are known for our premium quality, reliability, customer service, global
footprint, leading technology and breadth of product offerings. In our replacement businesses, we experience strong pull-through demand from end users who specifically request Gates-branded products from our channel partners. We believe that we are
the partner of choice when major customers are developing new platforms or upgrading existing ones.  Global Presence 
Our commercial and manufacturing footprint is global. With over 100 sales, R&D and operations locations around the world, we have
positioned ourselves close to our customers. Our products are sold in 128 countries with approximately 53% of Fiscal 2016 net sales originating from outside of North America and approximately 32% of our Fiscal 2016 net sales originating from
emerging markets. Our broad geographic footprint provides diversification from regional cyclicality and positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities in every region. 
Leading Market Positions  The breadth of
our catalog, our market share in many product categories and our share of available content with key customers put us in what we believe is a leading market position in most channels, regions and end markets in which we operate. With $1,862.1
million of Fiscal 2016 net sales in Power Transmission and $884.9 million of Fiscal 2016 net sales in Fluid Power, we believe we are the top global player in power transmission belts as well as a top-three global player in industrial hydraulic hose
and couplings, engine systems metals and oil and gas drilling hose. In Fiscal 2016, we estimate that 42% of our net sales were generated from leading market positions, while 83% of our net sales were generated from top three market positions. These
leading market positions combined with our strong brand serve as platforms from which we can extend our solution coverage in underpenetrated segments and generate sales growth in excess of our end markets. 
Channel Breadth and Relationships  We
believe that our regional commercial teams have established one of the broadest distribution networks in our industry, across a variety of end market-focused channels. Our distributors range from large corporations with numerous locations to small,
individually-owned companies with a single location. Located in 128 countries, our

channel partners provide global coverage and stock inventory of our products in close proximity to end users. They are able to generate demand for our products, as well as offer a point of
customer service and product knowledge for end users in their local language. Many of them also have the capability to configure or assemble our products to meet diverse end-user requirements where a suitable off-the-shelf solution is not available.
We have a demonstrated track record of building our presence in replacement channels in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe and South America. In regions such as Southeast Asia and China, we are leveraging this experience to build out our
channel presence utilizing unique programs. These extensive distribution networks give us the ability to access a broad base of end users and to reinforce the Gates brand. We believe that this established channel represents one of the largest
replacement footprints in the industry, enabling access to a large addressable market and rapid launches of new products to end users.  Product and
Catalog Coverage of Application-Critical Components  Our power transmission and fluid power product portfolios in the first-fit and
replacement markets are some of the broadest in our industry. We believe our product breadth simplifies our customers purchasing decisions and creates loyalty to us. In the automotive replacement markets, product coverage of the light vehicles
in a region, or car parc, is essential for the success of our distributors and installers. Within our core synchronous and Micro-V® belt product lines, our products can be used across 99% of
the North American, European and Chinese car parcs. These car parcs comprise over 70% of the global car parc of over 1.3 billion vehicles. We are focused in particular on expanding our catalog coverage in the more-fragmented car parcs in emerging
markets. For our industrial markets, we also believe we maintain an industry-leading portfolio of catalogs containing both general purpose and application-specific products for a variety of end markets. We continuously invest in updating our product
and catalog coverage to remain at the forefront of our industry and provide end users with convenient access to our comprehensive product portfolio. 
Our highly engineered power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment, process or system of
which they are components, creating a dynamic where the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is high relative to the cost of our products. Consequently, our products are typically replaced at regular intervals for preventative maintenance,
resulting in high-margin, recurring revenue streams. Our catalog coverage, combined with the mission-critical nature of our products, makes us a valued partner to our customers. 
History of Successful Innovation  We have
a storied history of successful innovation, from commercializing the V-belt to pioneering the use of certain synthetic elastomers in serpentine belts. We believe that our materials science expertise forms the foundation of our innovation
capabilities. Our products must be light-weight, withstand extreme temperature, pressure and load conditions, resist wear, maintain flexibility, avoid corrosion and fulfill other critical application requirements, all of which can only be met using
the latest advancements in materials science technologies. For example, we believe our carbon fiber technologies are best-in-class and continue to support our leadership position in several industrial power transmission product categories. Our
carbon fiber-based products outperform competitive offerings, further strengthening our leadership position. In addition, we have ongoing programs to develop Internet of Things (IoT) solutions enabling remote monitoring and predictive
diagnostics. These programs, along with other digital tools, improve the overall value proposition we deliver to our customers.  We hold a
substantial patent portfolio consisting of approximately 2,600 issued and filed patents, and have spent approximately 2% of net sales during each of the last three fiscal years on ongoing R&D activities. We employ over 500 engineers globally who
are dedicated to product and technology development. Many of these engineers work closely with our customers to design and develop application-specific solutions that not only solve immediate customer needs but also feed into our broader innovation
development efforts. Our R&D group

distribution channel presence and the fundamental value proposition of belt-drive systems. Industrial belt-drive systems often compare favorably to other types of industrial drive systems in
terms of their quiet, low-maintenance and efficient operation, as well as being relatively light-weight.  Materials science-based advances
in our product portfolio provide us with opportunities to displace competing drive systems in larger, high-torque applications that belt drives have historically been unable to address. We are also able to utilize our application engineering
capabilities to complement our product strength by assisting end users in optimal drive system design.  Extend Product Line in Fluid Power 
Gates products compete in the premium segment of the market, where customers value quality, portfolio breadth and design capability. Customers
in this segment use our products in numerous, demanding applications with a wide range of performance requirements. For example, there can be different product performance requirements for different hydraulic circuits within the same piece of
construction equipment.  Through materials science-based innovation, VA/VE and process engineering we will continue to broaden our
portfolio of fit-for-purpose fluid power products, optimizing their performance for different customer applications. This ongoing investment substantially increases the size of our addressable market and enables us to capture even more of the
premium segment.  Drive Technical Innovation in Our Markets 
We continue to invest in advanced development programs and our core R&D capabilities to ensure that we remain at the forefront of
innovation and product performance in our markets. We have established global centers of excellence that specialize in different functional areas of R&D with special emphasis on materials science and advanced modeling techniques. We utilize
long-standing relationships with our blue-chip customers to design products that meet or exceed their anticipated future performance requirements. Our commitment to continue to invest in these relationships and our R&D capabilities strengthens
our position to serve our core replacement markets with highly innovative and differentiated products to further increase the strength of our brand. 
Continue to Grow and Invest in Emerging Markets 
We have a long-standing presence in key emerging markets and a track record of driving growth from the early stages of a markets
development. We have successfully entered these markets by focusing on first-fit partnerships to establish our brand while building out our channels to serve the replacement base. Emerging markets continue to exhibit higher growth rates than mature
markets due to a number of factors, such as increases in industrial production, mechanization, urbanization, infrastructure development and vehicle ownership. To capitalize on these trends, we will continue to build out our catalog coverage, develop
regionally appropriate product portfolios, expand our channel coverage and optimize regional manufacturing capacity.  Pursue Strategic Acquisitions
 We intend to continue to strategically pursue and execute acquisitions to accelerate our growth strategies. Our markets are highly
fragmented, providing numerous inorganic opportunities for us to expand our reach and capabilities. We maintain a disciplined approach to acquisitions and target strategic opportunities where we can realize synergies by leveraging our brand, channel
presence, operating culture, global reach and other core competencies. We recently completed two acquisitions that were aligned with this philosophy: Techflow Flexibles in June 2017 and Atlas Hydraulics in October 2017.

Preliminary Fiscal 2017 data includes net sales with respect to Techflow Flexibles and Atlas Hydraulics, acquisitions that we completed during 2017, of $33.4 million since their respective date of acquisition.
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our income from continuing operations before taxes to EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. We believe income from continuing operations before
taxes is an appropriate measure for the reconciliation given that we have only recently completed the financial close process for Fiscal 2017 and have not had adequate time to complete our year-end tax accounting procedures, including an analysis of
the pending and uncertain effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Accordingly, there is a higher degree of complexity and lower visibility with respect to income tax accounting effects on our results for Fiscal 2017, including the need to adjust (or
re-measure) deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, as well as evaluate the valuation allowance for Fiscal 2017. We do not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed to develop a reasonable estimate of the tax
provisions for Fiscal 2017 and therefore an estimate has not been disclosed at this time. See Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of OperationsNon-GAAP Measures for a discussion on how we define and calculate Adjusted EBITDA and a discussion of why we believe this measure is important.

(a)
Share-based compensation has historically been provided to certain of our employees under share option, bonus and other share award schemes. We recognize a non-cash compensation
expense in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards determined at the date of grant. 


(b)
Transaction-related costs relate to business acquisition activity and major corporate transactions, including costs incurred in Fiscal 2017 in relation to the refinancing of certain of Gates indebtedness.



(c)
The inventory uplift impact on cost of sales arose as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of Techflow Flexibles and Atlas Hydraulics. 


(d)
Included in this amount in Fiscal 2016 is $17.7 million related to inventory adjustments made in connection with changes Gates has made in its accounting convention for expensing maintenance, repair and operations
assets below a nominal value threshold and revisions to its methods for estimating the write down for excess or obsolete raw materials and work in progress in Fiscal 2016. These changes have been made to bring consistency to our global inventory
management. In addition, this line item includes the write-off of inventory related to decisions made in Fiscal 2016 to restructure or close certain lines of business in the United States and in Singapore in
Fiscal 2016 and in Fiscal 2017. 


(e)
Restructuring expenses represent costs incurred in relation to specifically defined restructuring projects and include costs related to decisions to close lines of business, plant closures and relocations, strategic
organizational rationalizations and related non-recurring employee severance. 


(f)
Adjustments relating to post-retirement benefits are for the non-cash net interest charge related to those obligations, gains or losses from settlements and curtailments and the non-cash amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses. 


(g)
Other operating expense relates to gains and losses incurred on disposals of assets other than in the normal course of operations and gains and losses incurred in relation to
non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior periods. 


(h)
Sponsor fees relate to fees paid to Blackstone for monitoring, advisory and consulting services. The applicable agreements will be replaced upon completion of this offering. See Certain Relationships and Related
Person TransactionsTransaction and Monitoring Fee and Support and Services Agreements.  The following table sets
forth certain preliminary estimated metrics as of and for Fiscal 2017, as compared to Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Full Year 2014.

 THE OFFERING 
 


 Ordinary shares offered by us 
38,500,000 shares.    


 Over-allotment option to purchase additional ordinary shares from us 
5,775,000 shares.    


 Ordinary shares outstanding after giving effect to this offering 
283,974,605 shares (or 289,749,605 shares if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional ordinary shares).    



 Use of proceeds 
We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $709.5 million (or $815.9 million if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment
option to purchase additional ordinary shares).   


 
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to redeem all 235.0 million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) principal amount of our 5.75% senior notes due 2022 (the euro
notes), (ii) to redeem approximately $403.3 million principal amount of our 6.00% senior notes due 2022 (the dollar notes and together with the euro notes, the senior notes), (iii) to redeem our £50,000 redeemable
preferred share issued in connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions and (iv) the remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. We also intend to use approximately
$150.0 million of cash on hand to redeem an additional amount of dollar notes, conditioned upon the consummation of this offering.    


 Dividend policy 
We have no current plans to pay dividends on our ordinary shares. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of
operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Because we are a holding company and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from
funds we receive from our subsidiaries. In addition, our ability to pay dividends will be limited by covenants in our existing indebtedness and may be limited by the agreements governing any indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur in the
future. See Dividend Policy.   


 Risk factors 
See Risk Factors for a discussion of risks you should carefully consider before deciding to invest in our ordinary shares.   


 Conflicts of Interest 
 Affiliates of Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Because Blackstone Advisory Partners
L.P. is an underwriter in this offering and its affiliates own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is deemed to have

Table of Contents







 
 
a conflict of interest under Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with the requirements
of Rule 5121. Pursuant to that rule, the appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not required in connection with this offering as the members primarily responsible for managing the public offering do not have a conflict of
interest, are not affiliates of any member that has a conflict of interest and meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(12)(E) of Rule 5121. See Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest).

20,874,308 ordinary shares issuable in respect of outstanding options granted under the 2014 Omaha Topco Ltd. Stock Incentive Plan (to be renamed the Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2014 Stock Incentive Plan) and (the
2014 Incentive Plan) and the 2015 Omaha Topco Ltd. Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan (to be renamed the Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2015 Non-Employee Director Stock Incentive Plan) (the 2015 Non-Employee Director

 Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information 
Gates Industrial Corporation plc will be the financial reporting entity following this offering. Other than the inception balance sheet, the
financial statements of Gates Industrial Corporation plc have not been included in this prospectus as it is a newly organized entity, has no significant business transactions or activities to date, has no capitalization, and had no assets or
liabilities during the periods presented in this prospectus. The following table therefore sets forth the summary historical consolidated financial information of the Post-Acquisition Predecessor to Gates Industrial Corporation plc, Omaha Topco, for
the periods and dates indicated. The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 and the statement of operations and cash flow data for Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015, Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 and Pre-Acquisition
Predecessor 2014 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Omaha Topco included elsewhere in this prospectus. The balance sheet data as of September 30, 2017 and the statement of operations and cash flow data for the
nine months ended September 30, 2017 and the nine months ended October 1, 2016 have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Omaha Topco included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that, in our opinion, are necessary to present
fairly the financial information set forth in those statements. The results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the
results that should be expected in any future period. You should read the following summary consolidated financial data together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus and the
Capitalization and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of this prospectus. 
The unaudited combined results of operations for Full Year 2014 represents the mathematical addition of our Pre-Acquisition Predecessors
results of operations from January 1, 2014 to July 2, 2014, and the Post-Acquisition Predecessors results of operations from July 3, 2014 to January 3, 2015. We have included the unaudited combined financial information in
order to facilitate a comparison with our other fiscal years. Each of the Pre-Acquisition Predecessor and Post-Acquisition Predecessor results for the period from January 1, 2014 to July 2, 2014, and the period from July 3, 2014 to
January 3, 2015, respectively, have been audited and are consistent with GAAP. However, the presentation of unaudited combined financial information for Full Year 2014 is not consistent with GAAP or with the pro forma requirements of Article 11
of Regulation S-X, and may yield results that are not comparable on a period-to-period basis primarily due to (i) the impact of required purchase accounting adjustments and (ii) the new basis of accounting established in connection with
the Acquisition. Such results are not necessarily indicative of what the results for the combined period would have been had the Acquisition not occurred. See About this ProspectusFinancial Statement Presentation.

EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of income taxes, net finance costs, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors
and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net
operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense).
  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA
before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our businesses either period-over-period or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses and it is
used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating segments. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should, therefore, be made available to securities
analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses.  Management uses
Adjusted Net Income as an additional measure of profitability. Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) attributable to shareholders before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our businesses
either period-over-period or with other businesses. We believe that Adjusted Net Income should be made available to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses. 
During the periods presented, the items excluded from EBITDA in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA and from net income (loss) attributable to
shareholders in arriving at Adjusted Net Income primarily included:   


 

 
the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory held by Gates at the date of the Acquisition;   


 

 
the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation;   


 

 
transaction-related costs incurred in business combinations and major corporate transactions;   


 

 
impairments, comprising impairments of goodwill and significant impairments or write downs of other assets; 
  

   21 




Table of Contents







 

 
net interest relating to post-retirement benefit obligations, significant lump-sum settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses; 
 


 

 
restructuring costs;   


 

 
amortization of acquired intangible assets in the case of Adjusted Net Income;   


 

 
the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on financing-related items in the case of Adjusted Net Income;   


 

 
the net gain or loss on disposals and on the exit of businesses;   


 

 
fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services;   


 

 
the non-controlling interests share in the other adjustments in the case of Adjusted Net Income; and   


 

 
the tax effects of each of the above items in the case of Adjusted Net Income.  Differences
exist among our businesses and from period to period in the extent to which their respective employees receive share-based compensation or a charge for such compensation is recognized. Similarly, non-cash net interest relating to post-retirement
benefit obligations, significant lump-sum settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses may cause differences between our businesses and from period to period when comparing performance. We therefore exclude from
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation and the above adjustments related to post-retirement benefits in order to assess the relative performance of our businesses. 
We exclude from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income those acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805, Business Combinations, in particular, the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory
held by Gates at the date of the Acquisition and costs associated with major corporate transactions because we do not believe that they relate to our performance. In addition, the amortization of intangible assets recognized in respect of the
Acquisition hinders comparability of Gates to similar businesses that, for reasons of not having been recently acquired, do not recognize these acquisition-related intangible assets on their balance sheets and hence do not report any related
amortization. Other items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income because they are individually or collectively significant items that are not considered to be representative of the performance of our businesses. During the periods
presented we excluded restructuring costs that reflect specific actions taken by management to improve Gates future profitability; the net gain or loss on disposals of assets other than in the ordinary course of operations and gains and losses
incurred in relation to non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior periods; impairments of goodwill and significant impairments of other assets, representing the excess of their carrying amounts over the amounts that are expected to be recovered from
them in the future; fees paid to our private equity sponsor; and in the case of Adjusted Net Income, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on financing-related items. 
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore,
be used in conjunction with, not as substitutes for, profit or loss for the period. Management compensates for these limitations by separately monitoring net income (loss) from continuing operations for the period.

(a)
Share-based compensation has historically been provided to certain of our employees under share option, bonus and other share award schemes. We recognize a non-cash compensation expense in respect of these schemes that
is based on the fair value of the awards determined at the date of grant. During Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, Gates recognized an additional compensation charge of $7.5 million in relation to the early vesting of certain awards as a direct
result of the acquisition of Gates by Blackstone. 


 
(b)
Transaction-related costs include, in Full Year 2014, costs recognized in respect of the acquisition of Gates by Blackstone, primarily advisory fees. In other periods, these costs relate to business acquisition activity
and major corporate transactions, including costs incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2017 in relation to the refinancing of certain of Gates indebtedness. 


 
(c)
 The inventory uplift impact on cost of sales arose as part of the purchase accounting for the acquisition of
Gates by Blackstone in July 2014. The carrying value of inventory on hand was uplifted to its fair 
  

   23 




Table of Contents







 

value and, as this inventory was sold during the remainder of 2014, it was reflected in cost of sales at the uplifted value. This distorted gross margin and profitability for the period,
impacting comparability between periods. 


 
(d)
Included in this amount in Fiscal 2016 is $17.7 million related to inventory adjustments made in connection with changes Gates has made in its accounting convention for expensing maintenance, repair and operations
assets below a nominal value threshold and revisions to its methods for estimating the write down for excess or obsolete finished goods in Fiscal 2015 and raw materials and work in progress in Fiscal 2016. These changes have been made to bring
consistency to our global inventory management. In addition, this line item includes the write-off of inventory related to decisions made in Fiscal 2016 to restructure or close certain lines of business in the United States and in Singapore in
Fiscal 2016 and in the Middle East in Fiscal 2015. 


 
(e)
Other impairments in Fiscal 2015 included $44.0 million in relation to the indefinite-lived brands and trade names intangible that was recognized as part of the purchase accounting at the time of the Acquisition. A
further impairment of $6.7 million was recognized in relation to property, plant and equipment in Brazil, as a result of the challenging trading conditions in that region, which were exacerbated by the significant devaluation of the Brazilian Real
against the U.S. dollar. 


 
(f)
Restructuring expenses represent costs incurred in relation to specifically defined restructuring projects and include costs related to decisions to close lines of business, plant closures and relocations, strategic
organizational rationalizations and related non-recurring employee severance. 


 
(g)
Adjustments relating to post-retirement benefits are for the non-cash net interest charge related to those obligations and the non-cash amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses. 


 
(h)
Other operating expense relates to gains and losses incurred on disposals of assets other than in the normal course of operations and gains and losses incurred in relation to non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior
periods. 


 
(i)
Sponsor fees relate to fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services. In the case of Blackstone, the applicable agreements will be replaced upon completion of this offering.

Adjustments relating to post-retirement benefits are for the non-cash net interest charge related to those obligations and the non-cash
amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses. 


 
(h)
The amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes the amortization charge associated with customer relationship and technology intangible assets that were recognized as part of the purchase accounting
for the Acquisition.

Non-cash financing-related foreign exchange (gains) losses relate primarily to the retranslation of euro-denominated debt and non-U.S.

Sponsor fees relate to fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services. In the case of Blackstone, the applicable agreements will be replaced upon completion of this offering.
See Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsTransaction and Monitoring Fee and Support and Services Agreements. 


 
(k)
Other adjustments include the adjustment for the non-controlling interests share in each of the adjustments made and the net gain or loss on disposals of assets other than
in the ordinary course of operations and gains and losses incurred in relation to non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior periods. 


 
(l)
The adjustments above have been tax-effected using the effective tax rate for the relevant period, adjusted for significant items that are not tax deductible, primarily the impact of foreign currency exchange rate
movements on financing-related items, significant one-off tax items, and items that are deductible, but at a rate that is significantly different from the applicable effective rate.

Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of net sales. We use this metric as a measure of the success of our businesses in managing their cost base and
improving profitability. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNon-GAAP MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA Margin.

 RISK FACTORS 
An investment in our ordinary shares involves risks. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together
with the other information contained in this prospectus, before investing in our ordinary shares.  Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
 Conditions in the global and regional economy and the major end markets we serve may materially and adversely affect the
business and results of operations of our businesses should they deteriorate.  Our business and operating results have been, and
will continue to be, affected by worldwide and regional economic conditions, including conditions in the end markets we serve. The level of demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions that exist in our served end
markets. A substantial portion of our revenues are derived from customers in cyclical industries that typically are adversely affected by downward economic cycles. Our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages
or difficulty obtaining financing as a result of the effects of contraction or low levels of economic growth, disruptions in the financial markets, weak consumer and business confidence, high levels of unemployment, reduced levels of capital
expenditures, fluctuating commodity prices, bankruptcies and other challenges affecting the global economy, as happened following the global recession in 2008. For example, our historical results have been highly correlated to global industrial
activity and utilization and decreases in such activity or utilization may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and
services and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, our suppliers, distributors and vendors may experience similar conditions, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. If conditions
in the global economy or in the regions and major end markets that we serve deteriorate, demand for our products and services may be decline and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
 We are subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international operations, and this could adversely affect our
business and our strategy to capitalize on our global reach.  One of our key strategies is to capitalize on our global commercial
reach, and a substantial portion of our operations are conducted and located outside the United States. For Fiscal 2016, approximately 61% of our net sales originated from outside of the United States. We have manufacturing, sales and service
facilities spanning five continents and sell to customers in over 120 countries. Moreover, a significant amount of our manufacturing functions and sources of our raw materials and components are from emerging markets such as China, India and Eastern
Europe. Accordingly, our business and results of operations, as well as the business and results of operations of our vendors, suppliers and customers, are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including: 
 


 

 
instability in a specific countrys or regions political, economic or social conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;
  


 

 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate; 
 


 

 
imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital in a tax efficient manner; 
 


 

 
trade protection measures, such as tariff increases and embargoes, and import and export licensing and control requirements;   


 

 
the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions, including potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or from tax examinations, which may, in addition, require an extended period of time
to resolve; 
   27 




Table of Contents




 

 
partial or total expropriation by local, state or national governments;   


 

 
uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and intellectual property rights;   


 

 
the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments, including differing and, in some cases, more stringent labor and environmental
regulations;   


 

 
differing local product preferences and product requirements; and   


 

 
difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations, including challenges in administering and enforcing corporate policies, which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures.
 The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable.
Certain regions, including Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, are generally more economically and politically volatile and as a result, our operations in these regions could be subject to significant fluctuations in sales and operating
income from quarter to quarter. Because a significant percentage of our operating income in recent years has come from these regions, adverse fluctuations in the operating results in these regions could have a disproportionate impact on our results
of operations in future periods.  The new U.S. administration has publicly supported certain potential tax and trade proposals,
modifications to international trade policy and other changes which may affect U.S. trade relations with other countries. In addition, economic and political uncertainty arose out of the June 23, 2016 vote in the United Kingdom that resulted in
the decision to leave the European Union (the E.U.). It is possible that these or other changes, if enacted, may impact or require us to modify our current business practices. At the present time, it is unclear as to the ultimate impact
of these changes, policies or proposals and, as such, we are unable to determine the effect, if any, that such changes, policies or proposals would have on our business. 
Additionally, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and the ability of these countries to meet future
financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances of individual euro-area countries. If a country within
the euro area were to default on its debt or withdraw from the euro currency, or if the euro were to be dissolved entirely, the impact on markets around the world, and on our global business, could be immediate and material. Such a development could
cause financial and capital markets within and outside Europe to constrict, thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business, and also could cause a substantial reduction in consumer confidence and spending that could negatively
impact sales. Any one of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
If we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices in sufficient quantities, or at the time we require them, our operating
margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  We purchase our energy, steel, aluminum, rubber and
rubber-based materials, chemicals, polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources. We do not traditionally have long-term pricing contracts with raw material suppliers. The costs of these raw materials have been volatile
historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control. In recent years, the prices for energy, metal alloys, polymers and certain other of our raw materials have fluctuated significantly. While we strive to avoid this risk by using
price escalation mechanisms with respect to our raw materials in certain of our customer contracts and we also seek to offset our increased costs with gains achieved through operational efficiencies, if we are unable to pass increases in the costs
of our raw materials on to our customers, we experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers, or operational efficiencies are not achieved, our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely. 
Additionally, our businesses compete globally for key production inputs. The availability of qualified suppliers and of key inputs may be
disrupted by market disturbances or any number of geopolitical factors, 
   28

including political unrest and significant weather events. Such disruptions may require additional capital or operating expenditure by us or force reductions in our production volumes. In the
event of an industry-wide general shortage of certain raw materials or key inputs, or a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs from one or more of our suppliers, we may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of
certain raw materials or key inputs. Any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs. 
Adverse changes in our relationships with, or the financial condition, performance, purchasing patterns or inventory levels of, key
channel partners could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Certain of our businesses
sell a significant amount of their products to key channel partners, including distributors, that have valuable relationships with end users. Some of these channel partners may also sell our competitors products, and if they favor competing
products for any reason they may fail to market our products effectively. Adverse changes in our relationships with these channel partners, or adverse developments in their financial condition, performance or purchasing patterns, could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The levels of inventory maintained by our distributors and other channel partners, and changes in those levels, can also significantly impact our results of operations in any given
period. In addition, the consolidation of channel partners and customers in certain of our end markets could adversely impact our profitability. 
We face competition in all areas of our business and may not be able to successfully compete with our competitors, which could adversely
affect our revenues and profitability.  We are subject to competition from other producers of products that are similar to ours. We
compete on a number of factors, including product performance, quality, value, product availability, brand recognition, customer service and innovation and technology. Our customers often demand delivery of our products on a tight time schedule and
in a number of geographic markets. If our quality of service declines or we cannot meet the demands of our customers, they may utilize the services or products of our competitors. Our competitors include manufacturers that may be better capitalized,
may have a more extensive low-cost sourcing strategy and presence in low-cost regions or may receive significant governmental support and as a result, may be able to offer more aggressive pricing. Our competitors also may develop products that are
superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. If we are unable to continue to provide
technologically superior or better quality products or to price our products competitively, our ability to compete could be harmed and we could lose customers or market share. 
Pricing pressures from our customers may materially adversely affect our business. 
We generate strong margins by selling premium products at premium prices. Accordingly, our margins could suffer if our customers are no longer
willing to pay a premium for our product and service offerings. We face the greatest pricing pressure from our customers in the automotive first-fit end market. Virtually all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding
process and during the term of the award. We are also, from time to time, subject to pricing pressures from customers in our other end markets. If we are not able to offset price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced
expenditures or new product introduction, those price reductions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 
We are dependent on the continued operation of our manufacturing facilities and we may need to make investments in new or existing
facilities.  While we are not heavily dependent on any single manufacturing facility, major disruptions at a number of our
manufacturing facilities, due to labor unrest, adverse weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, significant

mechanical failure of our facilities, or other catastrophic event, could result in significant interruption of our business and a potential loss of customers and sales or could significantly
increase our operating costs.  In addition, we may need to make investments in new or existing manufacturing facilities to adapt our
production capacity to changing market conditions and to align with our growth strategies. The costs of such investments may be significant and we may not realize the expected benefits on our anticipated timeframe or at all, which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We may not be able to accurately forecast
demand or meet significant increases in demand for our products.  Certain of our businesses operate with short lead times and we
order raw materials and supplies and plan production based on discussions with our customers and internal forecasts of demand. If we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products, in terms of both volume and specific products, or react
appropriately to abrupt changes in demand, we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction. If demand increases significantly from current levels, both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand,
particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly. Additionally, we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels. Failure to accurately forecast demand or meet significant increases in demand could have a
material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations in
the international markets in which we operate.  We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated
in a variety of functional currencies. We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa. In addition, a decrease in the
value of any of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from non-U.S. operations and the translated value of the net assets of our non-U.S. operations when reported in U.S. dollars in our consolidated financial
statements. For example, in Fiscal 2016, movements in average currency translation rates adversely affected our sales growth by $67.7 million. Ongoing movements in average currency translation rates in the future could continue to have a
negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in currencies may also make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. 
We anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination. As a
result, to the extent we continue to expand geographically, we expect that increasing portions of our revenues, costs, assets and liabilities will be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency valuations. We may experience economic loss and a
negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Further, the markets in which we operate could restrict the removal or conversion of the local or foreign currency, resulting in our
inability to hedge against these risks.  We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations.
Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency
devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. Actions of this nature, if they occur or continue for significant periods of time, could have an adverse effect on our results
of operations and financial condition in any given period.  We are dependent on market acceptance of new product introductions and
product innovations for continued revenue growth.  The markets in which we operate are subject to technological change. Our
long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop, introduce, and market new and innovative products, 
   30

to modify existing products, to respond to technological change, and to customize certain products to meet customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The development of new product
introductions and product innovations may require significant investment by us. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be
unable to develop and market new products and applications in a timely fashion to satisfy customer demands. For example, the increased adoption of electric vehicles may affect certain of the end markets that we serve and could alter the application
platforms in which we offer solutions.  If we are unable to adapt to technological changes, including by developing and marketing new
products, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.  We have taken, and continue to take, cost-reduction
actions, which may expose us to additional risk and we may not be able to maintain the level of cost reductions that we have achieved. 
We have been reducing costs in all of our businesses and have discontinued product lines, divested non-core businesses, consolidated
manufacturing operations and reduced our employee population. The impact of these cost-reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors and we may not be able to maintain the level of cost savings that we have
achieved depending on our ability to successfully complete these efforts. In connection with the implementation and maintenance of our cost reduction measures, we may face delays in anticipated workforce reductions, a decline in employee morale and
a potential inability to meet operational targets due to an inability to retain or recruit key employees.  We are subject to risks
from litigation, legal and regulatory proceedings and obligations that may materially impact our operations.  We face an inherent
business risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and proceedings. We are involved in various tax, intellectual property, product liability, product warranty and environmental claims and lawsuits, and other legal, antitrust and
regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of every claim, lawsuit or proceeding and the range of probable loss, we believe these claims, lawsuits and
proceedings will not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on our results. However, we could, in the future, be subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings, including, amongst others, tax, intellectual property, product
liability, product warranty, environmental claims and antitrust claims, and we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of lawsuits and proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.
 Our products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we
are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and/or prohibit us from selling our products.  Third parties may
assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property rights. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully asserted against us may require us to
pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we are found to be willfully infringing another partys patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other consideration going forward if we are forced to
take a license. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products, product candidates or other technology, or those we
develop with our R&D partners. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. 
In addition, first-fit and other manufacturers have attempted to use claims of intellectual property infringement against manufacturers and
distributors of aftermarket products to restrict or eliminate the sale of 
   31 




Table of Contents

 
aftermarket products that are the subject of the claims. First-fit manufacturers have brought such claims in federal court and with the U.S. International Trade Commission and with various
foreign government agencies.  To the extent first-fit and other manufacturers are seeking and obtaining more utility and design patents
than they have in the past and are successful in asserting infringement of these patents and defending their validity, if any of our products are found to infringe someones patent, we could be restricted or prohibited from selling such
products, which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. 
In addition, certification by independent organizations of certain of our aftermarket products may be revoked or adversely affected by
first-fit manufacturer claims. Lack of certification may negatively impact us because many major insurance companies recommend or require the use of aftermarket products only if they have been certified by an independent certifying organization.
 Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights against counterfeiting activities could adversely affect
our business.  Although we routinely conduct anti-counterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions, we have encountered
counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. The actions we take to establish and protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent such
counterfeiting activities by others. If we are unsuccessful in challenging such products on the basis of trademark or other intellectual property infringement, continued sales of such imitating products may adversely affect market share and impact
customer perceptions and demand, leading to the shift of consumer preference away from our products and loss of market share.  We
will not seek to protect our intellectual property rights in all jurisdictions throughout the world and we may not be able to adequately enforce our intellectual property rights even in the jurisdictions where we seek protection. 
Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively
expensive, and the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. 
Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patent protection to develop their own products and
further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where the ability to enforce our patent rights is not as strong as in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our
intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent such competition. In addition, we may face significant expenses in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the United States. If we are
unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. 
Failure to develop, obtain, enforce and protect intellectual property rights or liability for intellectual property infringement could
adversely affect our business.  Our success depends on our ability to develop technologies and inventions used in our products and
to brand such products, to obtain intellectual property rights in such technologies, inventions, and brands, and to protect and enforce such intellectual property rights. In this regard, we rely on U.S. and foreign trademark, patent, copyright, and
trade secret laws, as well as license agreements, nondisclosure agreements, and confidentiality and other contractual provisions. Nevertheless, the technologies and inventions developed by our engineers in the future may not prove to be as valuable
as those of competitors, or competitors may develop similar or identical technologies and inventions independently of us and before we do. 
   32

 We may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property rights in our new
technologies and inventions or, if we do, the scope of such rights may not be sufficiently broad to afford us any significant commercial advantage over our competitors. Owners of patents or other intellectual property rights that we need to conduct
our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. Competitors and other third parties may challenge the ownership, validity, and/or enforceability of our patents or other
intellectual property rights. Further, we expect pirates to continue to counterfeit certain of our products using our trademarks, which has led to, and will likely continue to cause loss of sales. It is difficult to police such counterfeiting,
particularly on a worldwide basis, and the efforts we take to stop such counterfeiting may not be effective.  Our other efforts to enforce
our intellectual property rights against infringers may not prove successful and will likely be time consuming and expensive and may divert managements attention from the day-to-day operation of our business. Adequate remedies may not be
available in the event of an infringement or unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could
harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, successful assertion of our intellectual property rights depends on the judicial strength and willingness of the issuing jurisdictions to enact and enforce
sufficient intellectual property laws. Creation and enforcement of intellectual property rights is a relatively recent development in much of the world, and so some time may be necessary to realize reliable intellectual property systems across all
markets and jurisdictions, if this occurs at all.  We operate in industries with respect to which there are many third-party patents.
Owners of patents or other intellectual property rights that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable. We cannot assure you that our business
operations, products and methods do not or will not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Any claim relating to intellectual property infringement that is successfully
asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages, if we are found to be willfully infringing another partys patents, for past use of the asserted intellectual property and royalties and other
consideration going forward if we are forced to take a license. In addition, if any such claim were successfully asserted against us, we may be forced to stop or delay developing, manufacturing, selling or otherwise commercializing our products,
product candidates or other technology, or those we develop with our R&D partners. If we are sued for intellectual property infringement, we will likely incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims, even if we prevail. Any
of these risks coming to fruition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 
We may be subject to recalls, product liability claims or may incur costs related to product warranties that may materially and
adversely affect our business.  Meeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and requires manufacturers
to remedy defects related to product safety through recall campaigns if the products do not comply with safety, health or environmental standards. If we, customers or government regulators determine that a product is defective or does not comply
with such standards prior to the start of production, the launch of a product could be delayed until such defect is remedied. The costs associated with any protracted delay of a product launch or a recall campaign to remedy defects in products that
have been sold could be substantial.  We face an inherent risk of product liability claims if product failure results in any claim for
injury or loss. Supplier consolidation and the increase in low-cost country sourcing may increase the likelihood of receiving defective materials, thereby increasing the risk of product failure and resulting liability claims. Litigation is
inherently unpredictable and these claims, regardless of their outcome, may be costly, divert management attention and adversely affect our reputation. Although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will
continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate. In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products
and us.

 From time to time, we receive product warranty claims from our customers, pursuant to which we
may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Vehicle manufacturers are increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to participate in the warranty of their products and to be responsible for the operation of
these component products in new vehicles sold to consumers. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. It cannot be assured that costs associated with providing product warranties will not
be material.  We are subject to anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, as well as other laws governing our international
operations. If we fail to comply with these laws we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 Our international operations are subject to one or more anti-corruption laws in various jurisdictions, such as the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit employees and intermediaries from bribing or making other prohibited
payments to foreign officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA or other anti-corruption violations, and we
participate in joint ventures and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory
requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. 
We are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the U.S.
Department of Commerces Bureau of Industry and Security, the U.S. Department of Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, and various non-U.S. government entities, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on
countries and persons, customs requirements, currency exchange regulations, and transfer pricing regulations (collectively, Trade Control laws). 
We are also subject to new U.K. corporate criminal offences for failure to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion pursuant to the Criminal
Finances Act 2017 (FTP offences). The FTP offences impose criminal liability on a company where it has failed to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion by a person associated with the company. 
We have instituted policies, procedures and ongoing training of certain employees with regard to business ethics, designed to ensure that we
and our employees comply with the FCPA, other anticorruption laws, Trade Control laws and the Criminal Finances Act 2017. However, there is no assurance that our efforts have been and will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all
applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, or other legal requirements. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws, Trade Control laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017, we may be subject to criminal and civil
penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential
violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or the Criminal Finances Act 2017 by U.S. or foreign authorities could also have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Existing or new laws and regulations may prohibit, restrict or burden the sale of aftermarket products. 
Most states have passed laws that regulate or limit the use of aftermarket products in certain types of repair work. These laws include
requirements relating to consumer disclosure, owners consent regarding the use of aftermarket products in the repair process, and the requirement to have aftermarket products certified by an independent testing organization. Additional
legislation of this kind may be introduced in the future. If additional laws prohibiting or restricting the use of aftermarket products are passed, it could have an adverse impact on our aftermarket products business.

 Certain organizations test the quality and safety of vehicle replacement products. If these
organizations decide not to test a particular vehicle product, or in the event that such organizations decide that a particular vehicle product does not meet applicable quality or safety standards, we may decide to discontinue sales of such product
or insurance companies may decide to discontinue authorization of repairs using such product. Such events could adversely affect our business. 
Our information technology systems are decentralized, which may lead to certain security risks and make access to our applications
cumbersome.  In general, our information technology (IT) systems are decentralized. This decentralization may lead to
security risks and makes access to common applications cumbersome. We are in the midst of several large-scale information technology projects, including with respect to Enterprise Resource Planning systems and consolidation of applications and
servers. The costs of such projects may exceed the amounts we have budgeted for them, and any material failures in the execution of such projects may hinder our day-to-day operations. 
Our business could be materially adversely affected by interruptions to our computer and IT systems. 
Most of our business activities rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and IT systems and those of third parties
with which we have contracted. In the event that the providers of these systems terminate their relationships with us or if we suffer prolonged outages of these or our own systems for whatever reason, we could suffer disruptions to our operations.
In the event that we decide to switch providers or to implement upgrades or replacements to our own systems, we may also suffer disruptions to our business on this basis. We may be unsuccessful in the development, maintenance and upgrading of our
own systems, and we may underestimate the costs and expenses of developing and implementing our own systems. Also, our revenue may be hampered during the period of implementing an alternative system, which period could extend longer than we
anticipated.  Despite our implementation of security measures, our computer and IT systems are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or
shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components; hardware failures; or computer viruses, as well as circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including power outages; acts of malfeasance,
unauthorized access (hacking), acts of terror, acts of government, natural disasters, civil unrest, and denial of service attacks; any of which may lead to the theft of our intellectual property and trade secrets, the compromising of
confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data and production downtimes. This could also impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, account for and collect receivables, protect sensitive
data of the Company, our customers, our employees, our suppliers and other business partners, comply with our third-party obligations of confidentiality and care, or otherwise carry on business in the normal course. Any failure of these systems or
cybersecurity incidents could require significant costly remediation beyond levels covered by insurance and could cause us to lose customers and/or revenue, require us to incur significant expense to remediate, including as a result of legal or
regulatory claims or proceedings, or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is
constantly changing, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.  Our operations are subject to various
environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we may incur significant costs to comply with these requirements, or be subject to sanctions or held liable for damages resulting from any failure to comply. 
Our operations, products and properties are subject to extensive U.S. and foreign, federal, state, local and provincial laws and regulations
relating to environmental, health and safety (EHS) protection, including laws and regulations governing air emissions, wastewater discharges, waste management and disposal, substances in products, and workplace health and safety, as well
as the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites. EHS 
   35 




Table of Contents

 
laws and regulations vary by jurisdiction and have become increasingly stringent over time. Failure to comply with EHS laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and
operations, including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations, injunctive relief (including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities), and negative publicity. 
In addition, new EHS laws and regulations applicable to our business or stricter interpretation or enforcement of existing EHS laws and
regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, increasing global efforts to control emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (GHGs), have the potential
to impact us. Certain countries, states, provinces, regulatory agencies and multinational and international authorities with jurisdiction over our operations have implemented measures, or are in the process of evaluating options, including so-called
cap and trade systems, to regulate GHG emissions. The nature and extent of these measures varies among jurisdictions where we have operations. GHG regulation could increase the price of the energy and raw materials we purchase or require
us to purchase allowances to offset our own emissions. It could also negatively impact the demand for our products. For example, if the U.S. EPA continues to focus on GHG regulation, it could adversely affect our customers in the oil and gas
industry, which is a key demand driver of our industrial end markets. In addition, efforts to decrease use of fossil fuels in general may result in decreased oil and gas production and impact demand for our products. 
We could also be responsible for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination and may be subject to associated liabilities
and claims for personal injury and property and natural resource damages. We own, lease or operate numerous properties (many of which are sites of long-standing manufacturing operations), have been in business for many years and have acquired and
disposed of properties and businesses over that time. Hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents or other regulated substances or wastes may have been disposed of at or released from properties owned, leased or operated by us or at or from other locations
where such substances or wastes were taken for disposal. Such properties may be subject to investigation, clean-up and monitoring requirements. Under some environmental laws, liability for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites may be
imposed jointly and severally upon current or former owners, lessees or operators of a facility, or upon any party who sent waste to a disposal site, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the contamination. 
We have incurred, and will continue to incur, both operating and capital costs to comply with EHS laws and regulations, including costs
associated with the clean-up and investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations. We are currently performing environmental investigations or remediation at a number of former and current facilities in the
United States and Canada. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs to investigate and/or remediate conditions at those sites. We are also incurring costs associated with contamination at a number of offsite waste disposal sites. In the
future, we may incur similar liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our existing, prior, or future sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or
acquired. In addition, we are subject to personal injury and/or property damage claims alleging losses arising from hazardous materials associated with our current or former operations, facilities or products. The discovery of previously unknown
contamination, the imposition of new clean-up requirements, or new claims for property damage, personal injury or damage to natural resources arising from environmental matters or hazardous materials could result in additional costs or liabilities
that could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, our products may be
subject to EHS regulations in the markets in which we operate; such regulations are becoming increasingly common and stringent. These regulations may restrict or prohibit the types of substances that are used or present in our products, or impose
labeling or other requirements. For example, some of our products manufactured or sold in the E.U. may potentially be subject to the E.U.s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemical Substances regulation
(REACH), which regulates the sale of certain hazardous substances, or the Restriction of Hazardous Substances regulation (RoHS), which limits the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, or
similar requirements in 
   36 




Table of Contents

 
other jurisdictions. Any failure by our products to meet such standards could result in significant costs or delays relating to sale of such products, or require product reformulations or removal
from those markets as well as the imposition of fines and penalties.  See We may be subject to recalls, product liability
claims or may incur costs related to product warranties that may materially and adversely affect our business for additional risks relating to EHS regulations applicable to our products. 
Our insurance may not fully cover all future losses we may incur. 
Manufacturers of products such as ours are subject to inherent risks. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate,
but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or provide effective coverage under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Specifically, our insurance may not be sufficient to
replace facilities or equipment that are damaged in part or in full. Damages or third-party claims for which we are not fully insured could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. Further, due to rising insurance costs and
changes in the insurance markets, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Additionally, our insurance may subject us to significant deductibles, self-insured
retentions, retrospectively rated premiums or similar costs. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on us. We typically purchase business interruption insurance for our facilities. However, if we have a stoppage,
our insurance policies may not cover every contingency and may not be sufficient to cover all of our lost revenues. In the future, we may be unable to purchase sufficient business interruption insurance at desirable costs. 
We supply products to industries that are subject to inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions and failures and natural
disasters, which could result in unforeseen and damaging events. These risks may expose us, as an equipment operator and supplier, to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, and pollution and other environmental damage. The
insurance we carry against many of these risks may not be adequate to cover our claims or losses. Further, insurance covering the risks we expect to face or in the amounts we desire may not be available in the future or, if available, the premiums
may not be commercially justifiable. If we were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we were not able to obtain liability
insurance, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. If our clients suffer damages as a result of the occurrence of such events, they may reduce their business with us. 
Longer lives of products used in our end markets may adversely affect demand for some of our replacement products. 
The average useful life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and
manufacturing processes. The longer product lives allow end users to replace parts less often. As a result, a portion of sales in the replacement markets we serve may be displaced. If this trend continues, it could adversely impact our replacement
market sales.  The replacement market in emerging markets may develop in a manner that could limit our ability to grow in those
markets.  In emerging markets such as China, India, Eastern Europe and Russia, the replacement markets are still nascent as
compared to those in more developed nations. In these markets, we have focused on building a first-fit presence in order to establish brand visibility in the end markets we serve. However, as the replacement markets in these regions grow, our
products may not be selected as the replacement product, although we are the first-fit provider. If we are not able to convert our first-fit presence in these emerging markets into sales in the 
   37 




Table of Contents

 
replacement end market, there may be a material adverse effect on our replacement end market growth potential in these emerging markets. 
We may in the future acquire businesses or assets, which we may not be able to successfully integrate, and we may be unable to recoup
our investment in these businesses or assets.  We consider strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets to expand
our product portfolio and geographic presence on an ongoing basis, and regularly have discussions concerning potential acquisitions, certain of which may be material and which may be consummated following the completion of this offering.
Acquisitions, particularly investments in emerging markets, involve legal, economic and political risks. To successfully acquire a significant target, we may need to raise additional equity capital or indebtedness, which may increase our leverage
level. We also encounter risks in the selection of appropriate investment and disposal targets, execution of the transactions and integration of acquired businesses or assets. 
We may not be able to effectively integrate future acquisitions or successfully implement appropriate operational, financial and management
systems and controls to achieve the benefits expected to result from these acquisitions. As a result, we may not be able to recoup our investment in those acquisitions or achieve the economic benefits that we anticipate from these acquisitions. Our
efforts to integrate these businesses or assets could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions and increased competition. In addition, the process of integrating these businesses or assets could
cause the interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our existing business and the diversion of managements attention. Furthermore:   


 

 
the key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us;   


 

 
customers of the acquired company may decide not to purchase products from us;   


 

 
suppliers of the acquired company may decide not to sell products to us;   


 

 
the markets may reject the acquired technologies, or they may not integrate with our existing technologies as expected;   


 

 
we may experience business disruptions as a result of information technology systems conversions;   


 

 
we may experience additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, and financial reporting; 
 


 

 
we may be held liable for environmental, tax or other risks and liabilities as a result of our acquisitions, some of which we may not have discovered during our due diligence; 
 


 

 
we may intentionally assume the liabilities of the companies we acquire, which could result in material adverse effects on our business; 
 


 

 
our existing business may be disrupted or receive insufficient management attention;   


 

 
we may not be able to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits we anticipated, either in the amount or in the time frame that we expect; and 
 


 

 
we may incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisition, the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing shareholders. 
These impacts and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of these businesses or assets could negatively
impact our business and results of operations.  In addition, certain of the businesses that we have acquired and may acquire have
unaudited financial statements that have been prepared by the management of such companies and have not been independently reviewed or audited. We cannot assure you that the financial statements of companies we have acquired or will

   38 




Table of Contents

 
acquire would not be materially different if such statements were audited. Finally, we cannot assure you that we will continue to acquire businesses at valuations consistent with our prior
acquisitions or that we will complete future acquisitions at all. We cannot assure you that there will be attractive acquisition opportunities at reasonable prices, that financing will be available or that we can successfully integrate such acquired
businesses into our existing operations. In addition, our results of operations from these acquisitions could, in the future, result in impairment charges for any of our intangible assets, including goodwill, or other long-lived assets, particularly
if economic conditions worsen unexpectedly. These changes could materially negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
If we lose our senior management or key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected. 
The success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified
key personnel. In addition, there is significant demand in our industry for skilled workers. It cannot be assured that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and attract and retain other necessary personnel,
including skilled workers, necessary for the development of our business. The loss of the services of senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our business depends on our strong brand, and if we are not able to
maintain and enhance our brand we may be unable to sell our products.  Our brand has worldwide recognition and our success depends
on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. In particular, we believe that maintaining and enhancing the Gates brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining, promoting and enhancing our
brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as product innovation, product quality, intellectual property protection, marketing and employee training, and these investments may not have the desired impact on our brand image
and reputation. Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of our brand is tarnished or receives negative publicity. In addition, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal
action against us could damage our reputation and brand image and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If we are unable to maintain or enhance the image of
our brand, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We may be materially
adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.  As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 13,500 employees
worldwide. Certain of our employees are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters, we cannot assure you that future
issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Increased unionization of our workforce, new labor legislation or
changes in regulations could disrupt our operations, reduce our profitability or interfere with the ability of our management to focus on executing our business strategies. Any of these factors may have a materially adverse effect on us or may limit
our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers have unionized workforces. If one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage, it could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.  We have investments in joint ventures, which limits our ability to manage
third-party risks associated with these projects.  We have investments in joint ventures which may involve risks such as the
possibility that a co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt, be unable to meet its capital contribution obligations, have economic or 
   39 




Table of Contents

 
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or take actions that are contrary to our instructions or to applicable laws and regulations. Actions by a
co-venturer or other third party could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, we may agree to guarantee indebtedness incurred by a
joint venture or co-venturer or provide standard indemnifications to lenders for loss liability or damage occurring as a result of our actions or actions of the joint venture or other co-venturers. Such a guarantee or indemnity may be on a joint and
several basis with a co-venturer, in which case we may be liable in the event that our co-venturer defaults on its guarantee obligation. The non-performance of a co-venturers obligations may cause losses to us in excess of the capital we have
invested or committed.  Preparing our financial statements requires us to have access to information regarding the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of our joint ventures. Any deficiencies in our joint ventures internal controls over financial reporting may affect our ability to report our financial results accurately or prevent or detect fraud. Such
deficiencies also could result in restatements of, or other adjustments to, our previously reported or announced operating results, which could diminish investor confidence and reduce the market price for our ordinary shares. Additionally, if our
joint ventures are unable to provide this information for any meaningful period or fail to meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to satisfy our financial reporting obligations or timely file our periodic reports. 
Although our joint ventures may generate positive cash flow, in some cases they may be unable to distribute that cash to the joint venture
partners. Additionally, in some cases our joint venture partners may control distributions and may choose to leave capital in the joint venture rather than distribute it. Because our ability to generate liquidity from our joint ventures depends in
part on their ability to distribute capital to us, our failure to receive distributions from our joint venture partners could reduce our cash flow return on these investments. 
We are subject to liabilities with respect to businesses that we have divested in the past. 
In recent years, we have divested a number of businesses. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to
indemnify the buyer against liabilities arising prior to the divestiture, including lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims or environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to
liabilities arising out of such divestitures. As a result of these types of arrangements, conditions outside our control could materially adversely affect our future financial results. 
Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 As we have a large international footprint, we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us, our employees,
facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers due to terrorist acts, conflicts and wars, wherever located around the world. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived
threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a
decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive raw materials from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee
travel restrictions, and thereby materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
If we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other
events, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our facilities,
supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, public health crisis, or other natural or man-made 
   40 




Table of Contents

 
disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective
products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount
depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses. 
Certain of our defined benefit pension plans are underfunded, and additional cash contributions we may be required to make will reduce
the cash available for our business, such as the payment of our interest expense.  Certain of our employees in the United States,
the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, Germany and Japan are participants in defined benefit pension plans which we sponsor and/or have obligations to contribute to. As of December 31, 2016, the unfunded amount of our defined benefit pension plans
on a worldwide basis was approximately $61.7 million on an FASB ASC Topic 715 CompensationRetirement Benefits basis. The amount of our contributions to our underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns, funding
assumptions, regulatory requirements and a number of other factors and, as a result, the amount we may be required to contribute to such plans in the future may vary. Such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our
business such as the payment of interest expense on our notes or our other indebtedness.  The loss or financial instability of any
significant customer or customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  A
substantial part of our business is concentrated with a few customers, and we have certain customers that are significant to our business. During Fiscal 2016, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 25% of our consolidated net sales, and
our largest customer accounted for approximately 9% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of one or more of these customers or other major customers, or a deterioration in our relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  Our contracted backlog is comprised of future orders for our
products from a broad number of customers. Defaults by any of the customers that have placed significant orders with us could have a significant adverse effect on our net sales, profitability and cash flow. Our customers may in the future default on
their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons deriving from the general economic environment or circumstances affecting those customers in particular. If a customer defaults on its obligations to
us, it could have a material adverse effect on our backlog, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
Changes in our effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income. 
We are subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions in which we operate. As a result of Gates Industrial Corporation plc being U.K. tax
resident, the Company will be within the scope of U.K. corporation tax including the controlled foreign company regime. We consider that the non U.K. entities held directly or indirectly by the Company would not give rise to a material charge under
the U.K. controlled foreign companies rules. However, changes to, or adverse interpretations of, these rules, or changes in the future activities of the group, may alter this position and could impact the groups effective tax rate.
Additionally, we expect that the pre-IPO reorganization transactions will not give rise to material tax costs for the group, but there is no assurance of this position. 
Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and cash
tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than 
   41 




Table of Contents

 
anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to
examination by taxing authorities of our income tax returns for tax years 2012 to 2016 in the United States and for tax years 2007 to 2016 in other major foreign jurisdictions. The results of audits, examinations and other contests related to
previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Additionally, tax rates, tax laws or their implementation, and applicable tax authority
practices in any particular jurisdiction could change in the future, possibly on a retroactive basis, and any such change could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects of the Company.
 We are subject to changes in legislative, regulatory and legal developments involving taxes and the interpretation of those laws is
subject to challenge by the relevant governmental authorities.  We are subject to U.S. federal and state, and other countries
and jurisdictions, income, payroll, property, sales and use, fuel, and other types of taxes. These laws and regulations are inherently complex and the Company and its subsidiaries will be obliged to make judgments and interpretations about the
application of these laws and regulations to the Company and its subsidiaries and their operations and businesses. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations could be challenged by the relevant governmental authorities, which
could result in administrative or judicial procedures, actions or sanctions, the ultimate outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects of the Company. 
Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities may require
significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes; and as a result, such changes could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our results of
operations, financial conditions and liquidity. In this regard, new U.S. federal income tax laws were recently enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is complex and new (and it lacks administrative guidance), thus the impact
of certain aspects of its provisions on us is uncertain, including on our income tax expense for Fiscal 2017. In addition, the U.S., the E.U. and member states along with numerous other countries are currently engaged in establishing fundamental
changes to tax laws affecting the taxation of multinational corporations including pursuant to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developments Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The U.K. has already enacted significant
measures in this regard. Further, the United Kingdoms decision to leave the E.U. may result in changes to the interpretation and application of tax laws and regulations including changes to the interpretations of double tax treaties which
could lead to significant changes in the U.K. tax burden of the Company. In addition, it may become more difficult for cash to be repatriated to U.K. companies without the application of withholding tax and the tax treatment of the interest on any
intra-group loans may be impacted by these changes, both resulting in significant changes to the tax burden of the Company. Any such developments in the U.S. or in other countries could materially affect our tax burden and/or have a negative impact
on our ability to compete in the global marketplace.   We intend to operate so as to be treated exclusively as a resident of the
U.K. for tax purposes, but the relevant tax authorities may treat us as also being a resident of another jurisdiction for tax purposes. 
We are a company incorporated in the U.K. Current U.K. tax law provides that we will be regarded as being U.K. resident for tax purposes from
incorporation and shall remain so unless (i) we were concurrently resident of another jurisdiction (applying the tax residence rules of that jurisdiction) that has a double tax treaty with the U.K. and (ii) there is a tiebreaker provision
in that tax treaty which allocates exclusive residence to that other jurisdiction.  Based upon our anticipated management and
organizational structure, we believe that we should be regarded solely as resident in the U.K. from our incorporation for tax purposes. However, because this analysis is highly 
   42 




Table of Contents

 
factual and may depend on future changes in our management and organizational structure, there can be no assurance regarding the final determination of our tax residence. Should we be treated as
resident in a country or jurisdiction other than the U.K., we could be subject to taxation in that country or jurisdiction on our worldwide income and may be required to comply with a number of material and formal tax obligations, including
withholding tax and/or reporting obligations provided under the relevant tax law, which could result in additional costs and expenses. 
We may not qualify for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the United Kingdom and other countries. 
We intend to operate in a manner such that when relevant, we are eligible for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the U.K. and
other countries. However, our ability to qualify and continue to qualify for such benefits will depend upon the requirements contained within each treaty and the applicable domestic laws, as the case may be, on the facts and circumstances
surrounding our operations and management, and on the relevant interpretation of the tax authorities and courts.  Our failure to qualify
for benefits under the tax treaties entered into between the U.K. and other countries could result in adverse tax consequences to us and could result in certain tax consequences of owning or disposing of our ordinary shares differing from those
discussed in this prospectus.  The value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely
affect our results of operations and financial condition.  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes,
each quarter we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results, expectations of future earnings and tax planning
strategies. This topic requires that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The more-likely-than-not threshold
represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position. If a tax position is not considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits, no benefits of the
position are to be recognized. Moreover, the more-likely-than-not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence
to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses
in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, future changes in laws or regulations could have a material impact on the
companys overall tax position.  Our overall effective tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of our total
earnings before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are determined separately for each tax paying component (an individual entity) or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes in each jurisdiction. Losses in certain jurisdictions
which have valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets provide no current financial statement tax benefit. As a result, changes in the mix of projected earnings between jurisdictions, among other factors, could have a significant impact
on our overall effective tax rate.  Restriction on use of tax attributes may result from an ownership change under
applicable tax law.  Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), limits the
ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits. In general, an ownership change occurs if shareholders owning 5% or more (applying certain
look-through rules) of an issuers outstanding ordinary shares, collectively, increase their ownership percentage by 
   43 




Table of Contents

 
more than 50 percentage points within any three-year period over such shareholders lowest percentage ownership during this period. If we were to issue new ordinary shares, such new
shares could contribute to such an ownership change under U.S. tax law. Moreover, not every event that could contribute to such an ownership change is within our control. If an ownership change under
Section 382 were to occur, our ability to utilize tax attributes in the future may be limited.  Risks Related to Our Indebtedness 
Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations,
our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry or our ability to pay our debts, and could divert our cash flow from operations to debt payments. 
We are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2017, the total principal amount of our debt was approximately $4.0 billion (equivalent).
Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreements that govern our senior secured credit facilities, the indenture that governs our notes and the applicable agreements governing our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial
additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our high level of debt could increase. Specifically, our high level of debt
could have important consequences, including the following:   


 

 
making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;   


 

 
limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements; 
 


 

 
requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;   


 

 
increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   


 

 
exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;   


 

 
limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;   


 

 
placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and   


 

 
increasing our cost of borrowing.  We are a holding company, and our consolidated assets are
owned by, and our business is conducted through, our subsidiaries. Revenue from these subsidiaries is our primary source of funds for debt payments and operating expenses. If our subsidiaries are restricted from making distributions, our ability to
meet our debt service obligations or otherwise fund our operations may be impaired. Moreover, there may be restrictions on payments by subsidiaries to their parent companies under applicable laws, including laws that require companies to maintain
minimum amounts of capital and to make payments to shareholders only from profits. As a result, although a subsidiary of ours may have cash, we may not be able to obtain that cash to satisfy our obligation to service our outstanding debt or fund our
operations.  Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other
transactions which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.  We may be able to incur
significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although certain of the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these
restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications 
   44 




Table of Contents

 
and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade
payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor would increase. 
Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase
significantly.  Interest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our revolving credit facility or other
variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of September 30, 2017, after taking into account our interest rate derivatives, approximately $1,305.7 million (equivalent), or 32.9%, of our outstanding debt had
variable interest rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for
servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.  Certain of our debt agreements impose significant operating and
financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which could prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.  The credit
agreements that govern our senior secured term loan facilities and the indenture that governs our notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries
to, among other things:   


 

 
incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;   


 

 
pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;   


 

 
make certain investments;   


 

 
incur certain liens;   


 

 
enter into transactions with affiliates;   


 

 
merge or consolidate;   


 

 
enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments;   


 

 
designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and   


 

 
transfer or sell assets.  As a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we
conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include similar or more
restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders or amend the covenants. 
Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as other terms of our other indebtedness or the terms of any
future indebtedness from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less
favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control,
could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition. 
If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could
cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable 
   45 




Table of Contents

 
immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default.
Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of
acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. 
Repayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control.
 Our subsidiaries own all of our assets and conduct all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent
on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to Gates Global LLC, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. 
Unless they are obligors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on such indebtedness or to make
funds available to the notes issuers for that purpose. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the notes. Each
non-guarantor subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our non-guarantor subsidiaries. While limitations on our subsidiaries restrict their
ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to Gates Global LLC, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. 
In the event that Gates Global LLC is unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, it may be unable to make required principal and
interest payments on our indebtedness.  Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of our Ordinary Shares 
Our Sponsor and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. 
Immediately following this offering, our Sponsor and its affiliates will beneficially own approximately 85.9% of our ordinary shares (or 84.2%
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). Moreover, under our articles of association (the Articles) and the shareholders agreement with our Sponsor that will be in effect by the completion of this offering, for
so long as our Sponsor and its affiliates retain significant ownership of us, we will agree to nominate to our board individuals designated by such Sponsor. Even when our Sponsor and its affiliates cease to own ordinary shares representing a
majority of the total voting power, for so long as our Sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our ordinary shares, such Sponsor will still be able to significantly influence the composition of our board of directors and the approval of
actions requiring shareholder approval through their voting power. Accordingly, for such period of time, our Sponsor will have significant influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal
of our officers. In particular, for so long as our Sponsor continues to own a significant percentage of our ordinary shares, such Sponsor will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board
of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your ordinary shares as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect
the market price of our ordinary shares.   Our Sponsor and its affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities. In the ordinary
course of their business activities, our Sponsor and its affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our shareholders. Our shareholders agreement will provide that none of our Sponsor, any
of its affiliates or any director who is not employed by us or his or her affiliates will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we
operate. Our Sponsor also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our Sponsor may have an interest in our pursuing
acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to us and our shareholders.

 Upon the listing of our ordinary shares on the NYSE, we will be a controlled
company within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of
companies that are subject to such requirements.  After completion of this offering, our Sponsor will continue to control a
majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, we will be a controlled company within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the
NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain corporate
governance requirements. For example, controlled companies, within one year of the date of the listing of their ordinary shares:   


 

 
are not required to have a board that is composed of a majority of independent directors, as defined under the rules of such exchange; 
 


 

 
are not required to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and   


 

 
are not required to have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors. 
Following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, we do not expect a majority of the directors on our board will be
independent upon the closing of this offering. In addition, we do not expect that any of the committees of the board will consist entirely of independent directors upon the closing of this offering. Accordingly, you will not have the same
protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.  We
will incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of becoming a public company, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult to run our business. 
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred as a private company, including
costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and related rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
SEC) and the NYSE. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and
to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of
insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make
it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject
to delisting of our ordinary shares, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.  Our internal
controls over financial reporting currently do not meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and market price of the ordinary shares. 
Our internal controls over financial reporting currently do not meet all of the standards contemplated by Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act that eventually we will be required to meet. Because currently we do not have comprehensive documentation of our internal controls and have not yet tested our internal controls in 

   47 




Table of Contents

 
accordance with Section 404, we cannot conclude in accordance with Section 404 that we do not have a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant
deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls. Beginning with our second annual report on Form 10-K, our independent registered public
accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. If we are not able to complete our initial assessment of our internal controls and otherwise implement the
requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting. 
Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us
to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, which may result in a breach of the covenants under our financing arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in
the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm
were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. 
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations
regarding our ordinary shares, our share price and trading volume could decline.  The trading market for our ordinary shares will
be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our ordinary shares or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business,
our ordinary share price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our ordinary share price or trading volume to decline and
our ordinary shares to be less liquid.  There may not be an active trading market for our ordinary shares, which may cause our
ordinary shares to trade at a discount from their initial offering price and make it difficult to sell the ordinary shares you purchase. 
Prior to this offering, there has not been a public trading market for our ordinary shares. It is possible that after this offering an active
trading market will not develop or continue or, if developed, that any market will be sustained which would make it difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at an attractive price or at all. The initial public offering price per ordinary share
will be determined by agreement between us and the representatives of the underwriters, and may not be indicative of the price at which the ordinary shares will trade in the public market after this offering. 
The market price of our ordinary shares may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. 
Even if a trading market develops, the market price of our ordinary shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations.
Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares regardless of our operating
performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results or dividends, if any, to
shareholders, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or proposed changes in laws
or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar 
   48

companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or
capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in or individual scandals, and in response the market price of our ordinary shares could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your ordinary shares at or above
the initial public offering price.  Stock markets and the price of our ordinary shares may experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if
instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.  Because
we have no current plans to pay dividends on our ordinary shares, you may not receive any return on your investment unless you sell your ordinary shares for a price greater than that which you paid for them. 
We have no current plans to pay dividends on our ordinary shares. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on our ordinary
shares will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash
needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant.
In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by our senior secured credit facilities and notes and may be limited by covenants of other indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur in the future. As a result, you may not receive any return on
an investment in our ordinary shares unless you sell your ordinary shares for a price greater than that which you paid for them. 
English law will require that we meet certain additional financial requirements before we declare dividends and repurchase shares.
 Under English law, with limited exceptions, Gates Industrial Corporation plc will only be able to declare dividends, make
distributions or repurchase shares out of distributable reserves on Gates Industrial Corporation plcs stand-alone balance sheet, without regard to our consolidated financial statements. Distributable reserves are a companys
accumulated, realized profits, to the extent not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less its accumulated, realized losses, to the extent not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made. 
Immediately following completion of this offering, Gates Industrial Corporation plc will not have distributable reserves. At some point
following completion of the offering, we intend to seek the approval of a capital reduction by the English court to create distributable reserves that could be used for future dividend payments or to effect share repurchases. If that approval is not
received, Gates Industrial Corporation plc will not have sufficient distributable reserves to declare and pay dividends for the foreseeable future and Gates Industrial Corporation plc would be required to undertake other efforts to allow it to
declare dividends or repurchase shares following the offering. These efforts may include certain intra-group reorganizations which are established alternatives for the creation of distributable reserves in a U.K. public limited company. 
Investors in this offering will suffer immediate and substantial dilution. 
The initial public offering price per ordinary share will be substantially higher than our net tangible book deficit per ordinary shares
immediately prior to the offering. Consequently, if you purchase ordinary shares in this offering at an assumed public offering price of $19.50 per ordinary share, which is the midpoint of the range on the front cover of this prospectus, you
will incur immediate and substantial dilution in an amount of $27.38 per ordinary share. 
   49

 You may be diluted by the future issuance of additional ordinary shares in connection with
our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise.   Prior to the completion of this offering, a resolution will be adopted by our
shareholders to authorize our board of directors to allot our ordinary shares and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into such shares for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors
in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. Additionally, we have reserved 12,500,000 ordinary shares for issuance under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, and additional ordinary shares will become available under our
Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to provisions thereof that provide for automatic annual increases in the number of ordinary shares reserved under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, as more fully described in the section of this prospectus captioned
Executive and Director CompensationEquity Incentive PlansGates Industrial Corporation plc 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any ordinary shares that we issue, including under our Omnibus Incentive Plan or other equity incentive
plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who purchase ordinary shares in this offering. 
If we or our pre-IPO owners sell additional ordinary shares after this offering, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline.
  The sale of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur,
could harm the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for you to sell your ordinary shares at a time and at a price that you deem appropriate, if
at all. Upon completion of this offering, we will have a total of 283,974,605 ordinary shares outstanding (or 289,749,605 outstanding ordinary shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full). Of the outstanding ordinary
shares, only ordinary shares sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), except that any ordinary shares held by our
affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, may be sold only in compliance with the limitations described in Shares Eligible for Future Sale. 
The remaining outstanding 245,474,605 ordinary shares beneficially owned by our pre-IPO owners and management after this offering will
be subject to certain restrictions on resale. We, our officers, directors and certain holders of our outstanding ordinary shares immediately prior to this offering, including our Sponsors, that collectively will own depository receipts representing
244,849,003 ordinary shares following this offering, will sign lock-up agreements with the underwriters that will, subject to certain customary exceptions, restrict the sale of the ordinary shares held by them for 180 days following the date of this
prospectus. The underwriters may, in their sole discretion, release all or any portion of the ordinary shares subject to lock-up agreements. See Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest) for a description of these lock-up agreements. See
Principal Shareholders and Shares Eligible for Future SaleLock-Up Agreements.   Upon the
expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, all of such ordinary shares will be eligible for resale in the public market, subject, in the case of ordinary shares held by our affiliates, to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under
Rule 144. We expect that our Sponsor will continue to be considered an affiliate following the expiration of the lock-up period based on its expected share ownership and its board nomination rights. Certain other of our shareholders may also be
considered affiliates at that time. However, commencing 180 days following this offering, the holders of these ordinary shares will have the right, subject to certain exceptions and conditions, to require us to register their ordinary shares under
the Securities Act, and they will have the right to participate in future registrations of securities by us. Registration of any of these outstanding ordinary shares would result in such securities becoming freely tradable without compliance with
Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement. See Shares Eligible for Future Sale.  We intend to file one or more
registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares issued pursuant to the 2014 
   50 




Table of Contents

  
Incentive Plan, the 2015 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan or the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically become effective upon filing.
Accordingly, ordinary shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market. We expect that the initial registration statement on Form S-8 will cover 33,374,308 ordinary shares. 
As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our ordinary shares could drop significantly if the holders of these restricted ordinary
shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our ordinary shares or other securities or to use our ordinary
shares as consideration for acquisitions of other businesses, investments or other corporate purposes.  U.S. investors may have
difficulty enforcing civil liabilities against our company, our directors or members of senior management and the experts named in this prospectus. 
There is doubt as to whether English courts would enforce certain civil liabilities under U.S. securities laws in original actions or judgments
of U.S. courts based upon these civil liability provisions. In addition, awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the United Kingdom. An award for monetary damages under the U.S.
securities laws would be considered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and is intended to punish the defendant. The enforceability of any judgment in the United Kingdom will depend on the particular
facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. The United States and the United Kingdom do not currently have a treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters.  The rights of our shareholders may differ from the rights typically offered to shareholders of a U.S.
corporation.  We are incorporated under English law. The rights of holders of ordinary shares are governed by English law,
including the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act), and by our Articles. These rights differ in certain respects from the rights of shareholders in typical U.S. corporations. See Description of Share
CapitalDifferences in Corporate Law for a description of certain differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to us and, for example, the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to shareholders rights and
protections.  The U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the Takeover Code) applies, among other things, to an offer for a
public company whose registered office is in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man)
if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the Takeover Panel) to have its place of central management and control in the United Kingdom (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the
residency test. Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place of central management and control in the United Kingdom by looking at various factors, including the structure of our board of
directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.  If at the time of a takeover offer the Takeover Panel determines
that we have our place of central management and control in the United Kingdom, we would be subject to a number of rules and restrictions, including but not limited to the following: (i) our ability to enter into deal protection arrangements
with a bidder would be extremely limited; (ii) we might not, without the approval of our shareholders, be able to perform certain actions that could have the effect of frustrating an offer, such as issuing shares or carrying out acquisitions or
disposals; and (iii) we would be obliged to provide equality of information to all bona fide competing bidders.  Following the
completion of this offering, our Sponsor will have an interest in over 50% of our voting share capital, and therefore, if the Takeover Panel were to determine that we were subject to the Takeover Code, our

   51 




Table of Contents

 
Sponsor would be able to increase its aggregate holding in us without triggering the requirement under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code to make a cash offer for the outstanding shares in the Issuer.
 The Takeover Panel has confirmed to our representatives that, on the basis of our planned board of directors, it does not consider the
Takeover Code to apply to the Company, although that position is subject to change if our place of central management and control is subsequently found to move to the U.K. 
Our Articles provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder
in that shareholders capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in the Company or seeking relief on behalf of the Company, against the Company and/or the board and/or any of
the directors, former directors, officers or other employees individually, arising out of or in connection with the Articles or (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) otherwise, which could limit our shareholders ability to obtain
a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, former directors, officers or employees.  Our Articles provide
that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholders capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of
action vested in the Company or seeking relief on behalf of the Company, against the Company and/or the board and/or any of the directors, former directors, officers or other employees individually, arising out of or in connection with these
Articles or (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) otherwise. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or
our directors, former directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, former directors, officers and employees. The rights of stockholders under Delaware law and shareholders under English law in
relation to the bringing of shareholder suits differ in several significant respects. For a detailed discussion of these differences see the section entitled Description of Share CapitalKey Provisions of the Issuers Articles of
Association and English Law considerationsDifferences in Corporate Law of this prospectus. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our ordinary shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to
have consented to the provisions of our governing documents described above, as they may be amended from time to time.   Any
shareholder whose principal currency is not the U.S. dollar will be subject to exchange rate fluctuations.  Our ordinary shares
will be traded in, and any cash dividends or other distributions to be declared in respect of them, if any, will be denominated in, U.S. dollars. Shareholders whose principal currency is not the U.S. dollar will be exposed to foreign currency
exchange rate risk. Any depreciation of the U.S. dollar in relation to such foreign currency would reduce the value of our ordinary shares held by such shareholders, whereas any appreciation of the U.S. dollar would increase their value in foreign
currency terms. In addition, we will not offer our shareholders the option to elect to receive dividends, if any, in any other currency. Consequently, our shareholders may be required to arrange their own foreign currency exchange, either through a
brokerage house or otherwise, which could incur additional commissions or expenses.  Transfers of our shares outside DTC may be
subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in our shares.  On completion
of this offering, as noted below, it is anticipated that the new ordinary shares will be issued to a nominee for The Depository Trust Company (DTC) and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. On the basis of
current law, no charges to U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) are expected to arise on the issue of the ordinary shares into DTCs facilities or on transfers of book-entry interests in ordinary shares within DTCs
facilities and you are strongly encouraged to hold your ordinary shares in book-entry form through the facilities of DTC. 
   52 




Table of Contents

 A transfer of title in the ordinary shares from within the DTC system to a purchaser out of DTC
and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system, will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the ordinary shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the
relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC)) before the transfer can be registered in our company books. However, if those ordinary shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp
duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% to be paid by the transferor.   In connection with the completion of this offering, we expect to put
in place arrangements to require that our ordinary shares held in certificated form or otherwise outside the DTC system cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the ordinary shares has first delivered the ordinary shares to
a depositary specified by us so that stamp duty (and/or SDRT) may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depositary. Any such ordinary shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depositary. Before the transfer can be
registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put funds in the depositary to settle the resultant liability to stamp duty (and/or SDRT), which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares. 
For further information about the U.K. stamp duty and SDRT implications of holding ordinary shares, please see the section entitled
TaxationMaterial U.K. Tax Considerations of this prospectus.  If our ordinary shares are not eligible for deposit
and clearing within the facilities of DTC, then transactions in our securities may be disrupted.  The facilities of DTC are a
widely-used mechanism that allow for rapid electronic transfers of securities between the participants in the DTC system, which include many large banks and brokerage firms. We expect that our ordinary shares will be eligible for deposit and
clearing within the DTC system. We expect to enter into arrangements with DTC whereby we will agree to indemnify DTC for any SDRT that may be assessed upon it as a result of its service as a depository and clearing agency for our ordinary shares. We
expect these actions, among others, will result in DTC agreeing to accept the ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities. 
DTC is not obligated to accept the ordinary shares for deposit and clearing within its facilities in connection with this offering and, even
if DTC does initially accept the ordinary shares, it will generally have discretion to cease to act as a depository and clearing agency for the ordinary shares including to the extent that any changes in U.K. law (including changes as a result of
the U.K.s decision to leave the E.U., which could affect the stamp duty or SDRT position as further discussed in the section entitled TaxationMaterial U.K. Tax Considerations of this prospectus) changes the stamp duty or SDRT
position in relation to the ordinary shares. While we would pursue alternative arrangements to preserve our listing and maintain trading, any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our ordinary shares.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, our operations and
financial performance. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as outlook, believes,

could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors include but are not limited to those described under Risk Factors. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive
and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this prospectus. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future
developments or otherwise, except as required by law.

 MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA 
This prospectus includes market and industry data and forecasts that we have derived from independent consultant reports, publicly available
information, various industry publications, other published industry sources and our internal data and estimates. Independent consultant reports, industry publications and other published industry sources generally indicate that the information
contained therein was obtained from sources believed to be reliable.  Although we believe that these third-party sources are reliable, we
do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information, and neither we nor the underwriters have independently verified this information. Some market data and statistical information are also based on our good faith estimates, which are
derived from managements knowledge of our industry and such independent sources referred to above. Certain market, ranking and industry data included elsewhere in this prospectus, including the size of certain markets and our size or position
and the positions of our competitors within these markets, including our services relative to our competitors, are based on estimates of our management. These estimates have been derived from our managements knowledge and experience in the
markets in which we operate, as well as information obtained from surveys, reports by market research firms, our customers, distributors, suppliers, trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate and have not
been verified by independent sources. Unless otherwise noted, all of our market share and market position information presented in this prospectus is an approximation. Our market share and market position in each of our businesses, unless otherwise
noted, is based on our sales relative to the estimated sales in the markets we served. References herein to our being a leader in a market or product category refer to our belief that we have a leading market share position in each specified market,
unless the context otherwise requires. As there are no publicly available sources supporting this belief, it is based solely on our internal analysis of our sales as compared to our estimates of sales of our competitors. In addition, the discussion
herein regarding our various end markets is based on how we define the end markets for our products, which products may be either part of larger overall end markets or end markets that include other types of products and services.

 USE OF PROCEEDS 
We estimate that the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per
share, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $709.5 million (or $815.9 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional ordinary shares).  We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering (i) to redeem all 235.0 million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) principal amount of euro notes, (ii) to redeem approximately $403.3 million principal amount of dollar notes, (iii) to redeem our £50,000
redeemable preferred share issued in connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions and (iv) the remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2017,
235.0 million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) aggregate principal amount of the euro notes and $1,190.0 million aggregate principal amount of the dollar notes were outstanding. The euro notes and dollar notes mature on
July 15, 2022 and have interest rates of 5.75% per annum and 6.00% per annum, respectively. For a further description of our senior notes being repaid, see Description of Certain IndebtednessSenior Notes. We also intend to use
approximately $150.0 million of cash on hand to redeem an additional amount of dollar notes, conditioned upon the consummation of this offering. 
A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per share would increase or decrease, as applicable,
the net proceeds to us from this offering by approximately $36.4 million, assuming the number of ordinary shares offered by us remains the same as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions. An increase or decrease of 1,000,000 ordinary shares from the expected number of ordinary shares to be sold in the offering would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $18.4 million, assuming no change in the assumed initial public offering price per share. We expect any increase or decrease in the net proceeds received to correspondingly increase or decrease the principal amount of dollar notes
to be redeemed.   Pending specific application of these proceeds, we expect to invest them primarily in short-term demand deposits at
various financial institutions.

 DIVIDEND POLICY 
We have no current plans to pay dividends on our ordinary shares. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the
sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Because we
are a holding company and have no direct operations, we will only be able to pay dividends from funds we receive from our subsidiaries. In addition, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends will be limited by covenants in our existing
indebtedness and may be limited by the agreements governing any indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur in the future.  In the nine
months ended September 30, 2017, Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, we did not pay any dividends on Omaha Topcos shares.

giving effect to $57.0 million in outstanding letters of credit, (3) the $1,696.5 million U.S. dollar term loans (the Dollar Term Loans), comprised of the principal amount of $1,733.7 million and accrued interest of $0.5 million,
partially offset by deferred financing costs of $37.7 million, and (4) the 646.3 million ($760.5 million equivalent) euro term loans (the Euro Term Loans), comprised of the principal amount of $771.0 million
equivalent and accrued interest of $0.1 million equivalent, partially offset by deferred financing costs of $10.6 million equivalent. See Description of Certain IndebtednessSenior Secured Credit Facilities and Description of

235.0 million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) principal amount of euro notes and accrued interest of $3.4 million equivalent thereon, partially offset by deferred financing costs of $5.4 million equivalent. See
Description of Certain IndebtednessSenior Notes. As adjusted does not reflect the reduction in deferred financing costs of approximately $12.0 million in connection with the redemption of the senior notes. As adjusted also does not
reflect the additional amount of dollar notes that we intend to redeem using approximately $150.0 million of cash on hand, as discussed under Use of Proceeds.

 DILUTION 
If you invest in our ordinary shares in this offering, your investment will be immediately diluted to the extent of the difference between the
initial public offering price per share and the as adjusted net tangible book deficit per share after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per share offering price of the ordinary shares is substantially in excess of the as
adjusted net tangible book deficit per share attributable to the ordinary shares held by our pre-IPO owners.   Our net tangible book
deficit as of September 30, 2017 was approximately $(2,907.6) million, or $(11.85) per share. Net tangible book deficit represents the amount of total tangible assets less total liabilities, and net tangible book deficit per share represents
net tangible book deficit divided by the number of ordinary shares outstanding following the pre-IPO reorganization transactions.  After
giving effect to our sale of the ordinary shares in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per share, the midpoint range described on the cover of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses payable by us and the application of the proceeds therefrom as described in Use of Proceeds, our net tangible book deficit as of September 30, 2017 would have been $(2,237.3) million, or
$(7.88) per share. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of $3.97 per share to our pre-IPO owners and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of $27.38 per share to investors in this offering. 
 The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis assuming the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option:

   Each $1.00 increase in the assumed offering price of $19.50 per share would decrease our net
tangible book deficit after giving effect to the offering by $36.4 million, or by $0.13 per share, assuming the number of ordinary shares offered by us remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions.
A $1.00 decrease in the assumed initial public offering price per share would result in equal changes in the opposite direction.  The
following table summarizes, as of September 30, 2017, the total number of ordinary shares purchased from us, the total cash consideration paid to us, and the average price per share paid by pre-IPO owners and by investors in this offering. As the
table shows, new investors purchasing ordinary shares in this offering will pay an average price per share substantially higher than our pre-IPO owners paid. The table below reflects an assumed initial public offering price of $19.50 per share,
which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, for ordinary shares purchased in this offering and excludes underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us:

  Each $1.00 increase in the assumed offering price of $19.50 per share would increase
total consideration paid by investors in this offering and total consideration paid by all shareholders by $38.5 million, assuming the number of ordinary shares offered by us remains the same. A $1.00 decrease in the assumed initial public
offering price per share would result in equal changes in the opposite direction.  To the extent that outstanding options are exercised,
you will experience further dilution. The table below reflects, on an as adjusted basis as of September 30, 2017, the exercise of 20,874,308 ordinary shares issuable in respect of outstanding options granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan and 2015
Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan with a weighted average exercise price of $7.91 per ordinary share, settlement of 76,293 ordinary shares issuable in respect of restricted stock units granted under our 2014 Incentive Plan and an assumed initial

 SELECTED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA 
Gates Industrial Corporation plc will be the financial reporting entity following this offering. Other than the inception balance sheet, the
financial statements of Gates Industrial Corporation plc have not been included in this prospectus as it is a newly organized entity, has no significant business transactions or activities to date, has no capitalization, and had no assets or
liabilities during the periods presented in this prospectus. The following table therefore sets forth our selected historical consolidated financial information of the Post-Acquisition Predecessor to Gates Industrial Corporation plc, Omaha Topco and
Pre-Acquisition Predecessor to Omaha Topco, Pinafore Holdings B.V., for the periods and dates indicated. The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 and the statement of operations and cash flow data for Fiscal 2016,
Fiscal 2015, Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 and Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Omaha Topco included elsewhere in this prospectus. The balance sheet data as of
January 3, 2015 has been derived from the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Omaha Topco that is not included in this prospectus. The balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and the statement of
operations data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 (Fiscal 2013) and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 (Fiscal 2012) have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Pinafore
Holdings B.V. that are not included in this prospectus. The balance sheet data as of September 30, 2017 and the statement of operations and cash flow data for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and the nine months ended
October 1, 2016 have been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Omaha Topco included elsewhere in this prospectus. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated balance
sheet as of January 3, 2015 have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that, in our opinion, are necessary to present fairly
the financial information set forth in those statements. The results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year and our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results
that should be expected in any future period.

 MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Data and our
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that
could cause actual results to differ materially from managements expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors. 
Our Company  We are a global manufacturer
of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment manufacturers as specified components, with the majority of our
revenues coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. We sell
our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since
Gates founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are critical components in applications for which the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness
of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio
represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer,
manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in which we operate. 
During Fiscal 2016, we generated $2,747.0 million in net sales to over 8,000 customers in 128 countries, our net income was
$84.3 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $594.9 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from Fiscal 2015. During Fiscal 2015, we generated $2,745.1 million in net sales, our net income was
$50.9 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $547.2 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our net sales increased 8.7% to $2,259.9 million compared to $2,079.3 million
for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, our net income was $52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $69.0 million in the prior year period, and our Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.0% to
$496.1 million, compared to $447.0 million in the prior year period, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.0%, a 50 basis point increase compared to the prior year period. As of September 30, 2017, our total indebtedness was
approximately $3,916.1 million, or $3,236.3 million on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom. For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure
prepared in accordance with GAAP, see SummarySummary Historical Consolidated Financial Information.   Business Trends 
Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the
diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets across both our replacement and first-fit channels, including construction, agriculture, energy, automotive,
transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many others. This diversification limits our exposure to trends in any given end market. In addition, a majority of our sales are generated from customers in replacement channels, who
primarily serve a large base of installed

equipment that follows a natural maintenance cycle that is somewhat less susceptible to various trends that affect our end markets. Such trends include infrastructure investment and construction
activity, agricultural production and related commodity prices, commercial and passenger vehicle production, miles driven and fleet age, evolving regulatory requirements related to emissions and fuel economy and oil and gas prices and production.
Key indicators of our performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments.  During Fiscal 2016 and the
nine months ended September 30, 2017, sales into replacement channels accounted for 64.2% and 63.9%, respectively, of our total net sales. Of those sales into replacement channels, in Fiscal 2016 43.8% went into the industrial replacement channel
and 56.2% went into the automotive replacement channel. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, 46.1% of the sales into replacement channels went into the industrial replacement channel and 53.9% went into the automotive replacement channel.
Our replacement sales cover a very broad range of applications and industries and accordingly, are highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization and not a single end market. 
During Fiscal 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017, sales into first-fit channels accounted for 35.8% and 36.1%, respectively, of
our total net sales. Further, approximately half of our net sales to first-fit customers in both Fiscal 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were to industrial customers and the balance to automotive customers. Among our automotive
first-fit customers, a majority of our net sales are to emerging market customers, where we believe our first-fit presence provides us with a strategic advantage in developing those markets and ultimately increasing our higher margin replacement
channel sales. First-fit automotive sales in developed markets represented less than 10% of our total net sales in Fiscal 2016 and nine months ended September 30, 2017. As a result of the foregoing factors, we do not believe that our historical
revenues have had any meaningful correlation to global automotive production.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Results Compared with Nine Months

 Net sales 
Net sales during the first nine months of 2017 were $2,259.9 million, up by 8.7%, or $180.6 million, compared with net sales during
the prior year period of $2,079.3 million. Our net sales in the first nine months of 2017 were adversely impacted by movements in average currency exchange rates of $8.2 million compared with the prior year period, due principally to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese Renminbi ($9 million) and British Pound ($6 million), offset partially by the Brazilian Real ($7 million). Excluding this impact, net sales increased by $188.8 million, or 9.1%, during
the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared with the prior year period. This increase was due almost exclusively to higher sales volumes of approximately $180 million, with no significant impact from pricing. 
Sales in our Power Transmission and Fluid Power businesses grew by 6.3% and 13.6%, respectively. This growth was focused in the industrial
markets, where we continued to see recovery across all regions, and predominantly in the replacement channels. Growth in our construction, agriculture and general industrial end markets was 19.5%, 12.8% and 12.3%, respectively. Industrial demand
increased globally, but Asia and North America performed particularly well, with sales to industrial end markets increasing by 24.4% (or $41.1 million) and 12.0% (or $61.7 million), respectively, compared with the prior year period. In Asia, this
growth was driven by China, where industrial sales grew by 45.4% compared with the prior year period. The automotive end markets contributed a further $43.8 million in sales growth during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, driving
24.2% of our total growth, primarily in China, which grew by 16.4% compared with the prior year period. Sales in the energy end market, a smaller component of our business comprising approximately 7.0% of our net sales in the nine months of 2017,
grew by 15.5%.  Cost of sales 
Cost of sales for the first nine months of 2017 was $1,343.9 million, an increase of 6.4%, or $81.0 million, compared with
$1,262.9 million in the prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by higher volumes ($110.6 million) and, to a lesser extent, by raw material inflation ($15.8 million), offset partially by productivity improvements of
$24.4 million, a decrease of $12.5 million in depreciation, and favorable impacts of $3.7 million from prior period inventory adjustments related to decisions made in 2016 to close certain lines of business in Singapore. 
Gross profit 
Gross profit for the first nine months of 2017 was $916.0 million, up 12.2% from $816.4 million during the prior year period. The
increase reflects the impact of higher net sales driven by volumes as well as manufacturing improvements.  Our gross profit margin
increased to 40.5% during the first nine months of 2017 from 39.3% during the prior year period. Gross profit margin increased 120 basis points in the period due to increased sales volumes on our partially fixed cost base and our productivity
improvements.  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the first nine months of 2017 were $586.1 million compared with
$570.0 million during the prior year period. This increase of $16.1 million was driven primarily by higher selling and distribution expenses of $23.1 million, which increased broadly in line with the higher net sales in the period and
higher labor and benefits costs of $12.3 million as we continue to invest in our commercial function. These higher costs were partially offset by lower intangible asset amortization of $16.9 million compared with the prior year period.
 Transaction-related costs 
Transaction-related costs for the first nine months of 2017 were $11.3 million compared with zero during the prior year period. Expenses
in the first nine months of 2017 included $4.3 million related to payments made 
   67

on resolution of certain contingencies that affected the purchase price paid by Blackstone on acquiring Gates in July 2014 and $2.0 million related to professional fees incurred as part of
the debt refinancing initiated during March 2017. The remainder of the costs incurred during the current period related primarily to acquisition activities including the acquisition of Techflow Flexibles. 
Restructuring expenses 
Restructuring costs of $8.3 million were recognized during the first nine months of 2017, including $6.1 million in relation to
severance costs, primarily in the U.S., Europe and China associated with organizational rationalizations.  Restructuring costs of
$8.0 million were recognized during the prior year period, including $7.3 million in relation to severance costs, largely in North America and Europe. 
Interest expense 
Interest expense for the first nine months of 2017 was $179.0 million compared with $162.4 million for the prior year period. Our
interest expense may be analyzed as follows:

 Details of the bank and other loans are presented in note 13 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. Interest expense includes the amortization of issue costs incurred in relation to the debt and the amortization of the deferred premium on our interest rate caps. Interest expense during the first
nine months of 2017 increased over the prior year period due to the debt refinancing completed in April 2017 which caused a $14.2 million acceleration of deferred financing costs on the Dollar Term Loan due to the $650 million partial
repayment of that tranche. This impact was offset partially by a lower interest charge incurred due to the partial Dollar Term Loan repayment on April 7, 2017. The interest on the Euro Term Loan increased from $8.0 million in the prior
year period to $16.4 million in the first nine months of 2017 as a result of the additional debt of 466.2 million drawn on April 7, 2017, offset partially by a reduction in the rate of interest on this facility. The interest
associated with the dollar notes increased due to the additional $150 million of debt incurred on March 30, 2017 as part of the refinancing.

 Other (expense) income 
Other expense for the first nine months of 2017 was $46.1 million, which changed from $5.3 million of other income in the prior year
period driven primarily by the impacts of movements in currency exchange rates on unhedged net debt and derivative instruments. Included in unhedged debt as of September 30, 2017, is 389.7 million of the additional
466.2 million Euro Term Loan debt borrowing drawn in April 2017, which did not qualify for net investment hedging. Our other (expense) income may be analyzed as follows:

 Income tax expense 
For interim income tax reporting we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply this effective tax rate to our year to date pre-tax income. The tax effects of unusual or infrequently occurring items, including the effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are reported in the interim period in which they occur. 
For the first nine months of 2017, the company had income tax expense of $32.9 million on pre-tax
income of $85.3 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 38.6% compared with an income tax expense of $15.1 million on pre-tax income of $80.2 million, which resulted in an effective
income tax rate of 18.8% for the prior year period. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is primarily the result of our geographical mix of earnings, the buyout of certain U.S. pension plans, and changes in valuation
allowances of $14.5 million. In fiscal year 2016, the company recognized tax benefits related to the release of uncertain tax positions, tax law changes, and non-taxable debt forgiveness income of $5.5
million.  Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2017 was $496.1 million, an increase of 11.0% or $49.1 million, compared with the prior
year period Adjusted EBITDA of $447.0 million. The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 22.0%, a 50 basis point increase from the prior year period margin of 21.5%. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes
($67.9 million) and productivity improvements in costs of sales ($24.4 million), partially offset by raw material inflation of $15.8 million, and SG&A spend ($27.7 million). For a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each of
the periods presented and the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA margin, see Non-GAAP Measures.

 Power Transmission 
Net sales in Power Transmission for the first nine months of 2017 were $1,496.3 million, an increase of 6.3%, or $89.0 million, when
compared with the prior year period net sales of $1,407.3 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $7.1 million, net sales increased by 6.8%, or $96.1 million, compared with the prior
year period. The increase was due almost entirely to higher sales volumes, with no significant impact from pricing.  More than half of the
volume gains arose from sales to the industrial end markets, with sales to the general industrial end market being the largest component. Growth in sales to this end market, which comprised 21.1% of Power Transmission sales in the first nine months
of 2017, was 11.7%, benefitting from the continuing industrial improvement, particularly in North America. The remainder of the sales volume growth arose in the automotive end market, driven primarily by strong demand in China, particularly in the first-fit channel.  Cost of sales in Power Transmission for the first nine months of 2017 was
$874.6 million, an increase of 4.0%, or $34.0 million, compared with $840.6 million in the prior year period. The gross margin of 41.5% for the first nine months of 2017 was up from 40.3% in the prior year period. Cost of sales in the
first nine months of 2017 increased primarily due to higher volumes of approximately $51.2 million and inflation of $11.7 million, predominantly on raw materials in North America and Asia. Partially offsetting the cost of sales increases
were benefits from our productivity improvements of $19.9 million as compared with the prior year period. These factors drove the 120 basis point improvement in gross margin in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the prior year period.
 Other operating expenses in Power Transmission for the first nine months of 2017 were $394.4 million, an increase of
$8.2 million compared with $386.2 million in the prior year period. The majority of the increase was driven by higher SG&A costs of $18.8 million, including $10.9 million of increased selling and distribution costs associated
with the higher sales volumes. A further increase in other operating expenses was due to the transaction costs of $5.7 million incurred in 2017, including $2.8 million in relation to contingencies that affected the purchase price paid by
Blackstone on acquiring Gates in July 2014 and $1.3 million related to professional fees incurred as part of the debt refinancing initiated during March 2017. Offsetting these increases were lower amortization of acquired intangible assets of
$9.7 million and lower depreciation of $9.0 million.  Our Power Transmission segment recognized operating income of
$227.3 million for the first nine months of 2017, compared with operating income of $180.5 million in the prior year period. Operating income includes depreciation and amortization, which decreased during the first nine months of 2017 by
$18.7 million compared with the prior year period. As these items are adjusted out of the segment measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in a period-over-period increase in operating income that is not reflected in Adjusted
EBITDA.

 Our Power Transmission Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2017 was $342.4 million,
an increase of 9.2% or $28.9 million, compared with the prior year period Adjusted EBITDA of $313.5 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes ($41.7 million) and productivity improvements ($19.9
million); offset partially by inflation ($11.7 million) and increased SG&A spend ($18.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first nine months of 2017 was 22.9%, a 60 basis point improvement from the prior year period margin of 22.3%
due to the factors discussed above.  Fluid Power (33.8% of Gates net sales for the first nine months of 2017)

 Net sales in Fluid Power for the first nine months of 2017 were $763.6 million, an increase of 13.6%, or
$91.6 million, compared with net sales during the prior year period of $672.0 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $1.1 million, net sales increased by 13.8%, or $92.7 million,
compared with the prior year period. This increase was due primarily to higher volumes ($85.5 million) and higher sales prices ($4.1 million). 
Volumes grew across all of our end markets during the first nine months of 2017 compared with the prior year period, with almost all of this
increase arising from sales to the industrial end markets. Sales to the construction and agriculture end markets, which comprised almost 40% of Fluid Powers net sales for the first nine months of 2017, improved by 21.1% and 12.4%,
respectively. Sales to the energy end market increased by 17.8%, driven by a 23.3% increase in oil & gas sales, particularly in North America. 
Cost of sales in Fluid Power for the first nine months of 2017 was $469.3 million, an increase of 11.0%, or $46.4 million, compared
with $422.9 million in the prior year period. The gross margin of 38.5% for the first nine months of 2017 was up from 37.1% in the prior year period. The increase in cost of sales was driven primarily by higher volumes. Inflation of
$5.6 million, predominantly on raw materials, was mostly offset by productivity improvements of $5.2 million as compared with the prior year period. These factors drove the 140 basis point improvement in gross margin in the first nine
months of 2017 compared with the prior year period.  Other operating expenses in Fluid Power for the first nine months of 2017 were
$211.2 million, an increase of 9.8% or $18.9 million, compared with $192.3 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily the result of higher SG&A spend of $9.0 million, which related primarily to the increase
in selling and distribution costs incurred on higher sales when compared with the prior year period. Other increases included transaction costs of $5.6 million incurred during the first nine months of 2017. The transaction costs included
$3.5 million associated with acquisition related activities, including the acquisition of Techflow Flexibles and, subsequent to September 30, 2017, the acquisition of Atlas Hydraulics. Transaction costs also included $1.4 million in
relation to contingencies that affected the purchase price paid by Blackstone on acquiring Gates in July 2014 and $0.7 million related to professional fees incurred as part of the debt refinancing initiated during March 2017. These increases
were offset by $8.2 million of lower intangible asset amortization in the first nine months of 2017 compared with the prior year period.

 Our Fluid Power segment recognized operating income of $83.1 million for the first nine
months of 2017, compared with operating income of $56.8 million in the prior year period. Operating income includes depreciation and amortization, which decreased during the first nine months of 2017 by $11.7 million compared with the
prior year period. As these items are adjusted out of the segment measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in a period-over-period increase in operating income that is not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the first nine months of 2017 was $153.7 million, an increase of 15.1%, or $20.2 million, compared with the
prior year period Adjusted EBITDA of $133.5 million. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by higher sales volumes ($25.4 million), productivity improvements ($5.2 million) and favorable pricing actions ($4.1 million); partially offset by
inflation ($5.6 million) and SG&A spend ($9.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.1%, a 20 basis point improvement from the prior year period margin of 19.9% as the benefits from productivity improvements more than offset the
abovementioned inflation and mix.  Fiscal 2016 Results Compared with Fiscal 2015 Results

 Net sales 
Net sales in Fiscal 2016 were $2,747.0 million, an increase of $1.9 million compared with net sales during Fiscal 2015 of
$2,745.1 million. Our net sales for Fiscal 2016 were adversely impacted by movements in average currency translation rates, particularly the Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi and Argentine Peso for an aggregate of $67.7 million.
Excluding this impact, net sales increased by $69.6 million, or 2.5%, in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015. This increase was driven by higher sales prices ($28.3 million) and higher volumes ($26.2 million). 
The volume increase arose mostly in our Power Transmission business, which grew by $72.4 million, or 5.4%, compared with Fiscal 2015.
This growth was predominantly in sales to the automotive end market, which grew by 10.4% and grew across all of our regions. China in particular performed well with a 12.2% growth in sales to the replacement channels and 10.0% growth in sales to the
first-fit channel as our businesses benefitted 
   72

from government automotive stimulus programs as well as market share gains. This was partially offset by lower volumes to Power Transmissions industrial end markets, split equally between
the replacement and first-fit channels. Volumes contracted in Fluid Power during Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015, with sales down by $46.2 million as a result. The automotive end market in Fluid
Power also proved resilient, with volume growth of 5.7%, including strong demand from emerging markets such as Russia. This was more than offset by the weaker sales to the industrial end markets, concentrated in the replacement channel, where
volumes were down by $54.6 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015. Driving this decrease were lower sales to the energy and transportation end markets, which together accounted for 30.7% of Fluid Powers Fiscal 2016 sales and for
which core growth fell by 14.4% and 7.4%, respectively. Pricing gains were split relatively equally between Power Transmission and Fluid Power and were focused primarily in North America, with approximately $13 million carried over from actions in
Fiscal 2015 and $5 million from new actions in Fiscal 2016.  Cost of Sales 
Cost of sales in Fiscal 2016 were $1,686.2 million, a decrease of 1.3% or $22.8 million, compared with $1,709.0 million in
Fiscal 2015. The decrease was driven by productivity improvements, primarily procurement initiatives of $29.1 million, and favorable impacts from average foreign currency exchange rates of $23.3 million. Partially offsetting the overall
decrease in cost of sales were the negative impacts of inventory adjustments of $17.7 million related to changes we made in our accounting convention for expensing maintenance, repair and operations assets below a nominal value threshold. This
change was made to bring consistency to our global inventory management. Also increasing cost of sales were volume increases of approximately $16 million. 
Gross Profit 
Gross profit for Fiscal 2016 was $1,060.8 million, up $2.4% or $24.7 million, compared with $1,036.1 million in Fiscal 2015. The
increase is principally due to increased sales volumes and prices as described above.  Our gross profit margin for Fiscal 2016 was
38.6%, up from 37.7% in Fiscal 2015. The 90 basis point improvement was due to increased sales volumes on our partially fixed cost base and our productivity improvements, offset partially by the labor inflation and inventory adjustments noted above.
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Total SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2016 were $744.1 million, a decrease of 5.1% or $40.4 million, compared with $784.5 million in
Fiscal 2015. SG&A expenses are comprised primarily of selling and distribution costs, administrative expenses, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and R&D costs. 
Selling and distribution costs were $295.0 million in Fiscal 2016, compared with $305.6 million in Fiscal 2015, a decrease of
$10.6 million. As a percentage of sales, our Fiscal 2016 costs were flat at 11% compared with the prior year, as labor-related cost inflation was broadly offset by headcount reductions. 
The remainder of the SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2016 were $449.1 million, compared with $478.9 million in Fiscal 2015, a decrease
of $29.8 million. The decrease in these costs in Fiscal 2016 was due principally to labor spending reductions to right-size the business of $12.3 million. The amortization of acquired intangible assets reduced from $158.5 million in
Fiscal 2015 to $141.9 million in Fiscal 2016 (a decrease of $16.6 million), due primarily to the majority of our technology intangible assets recognized at the time of the acquisition of Gates by Blackstone becoming fully amortized halfway
through Fiscal 2016.

 Impairment of Goodwill and Other Assets 
For Fiscal 2016, we recognized impairments of $3.2 million, relating primarily to discontinuing the use of software in North America and
the impairment of a receivable related to a restructured line of business in the U.S.  For Fiscal 2015, we recognized impairments of
$51.1 million, including $44.0 million in relation to the U.S. dollar denominated indefinite-lived brands and trade names intangible that was recognized as part of the purchase accounting at the time of the Acquisition. The impairment
arose due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which the sales supporting the value of this asset were denominated. A further impairment of $6.7 million was recognized in relation to property, plant and equipment in
Brazil, as a result of the challenging trading conditions in that region, which were exacerbated by the significant devaluation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. 
Restructuring Expenses 
During Fiscal 2016, we recognized restructuring expenses of $11.4 million, compared with $15.6 million in Fiscal 2015. In both
periods, these costs related primarily to severance expenses incurred across both segments as part of the right-sizing of our operations and the streamlining of our corporate functions. 
Other Operating Expense 
During Fiscal 2016, we recognized other operating expense of $3.3 million, primarily in relation to a business disposed of in a prior
year. In addition, there were $0.4 million of transaction costs. These combined expenses were offset by a benefit in tax expense, due to the release of a tax contingency that was held in respect of the disposed business. 
During Fiscal 2015, we recognized other operating expense of $0.5 million, primarily in relation to transaction costs. 
Operating Income from Continuing Operations 
Operating income from continuing operations in Fiscal 2016 was $298.8 million, compared with $184.4 million in Fiscal 2015. The
increase was driven primarily by increased gross margin, decreased SG&A spend and the higher impairment expense recognized in Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2016. 
Interest Expense 
The interest expense for Fiscal 2016 was $216.3 million, compared with $212.6 million for Fiscal 2015. Our interest expense may be

 Details of our debt are presented in note 17 of our audited consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this prospectus. Interest expense includes the amortization of issue costs incurred in relation to the borrowings. 
The increase in interest expense during Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015 was due largely to an increase of $4.7 million in the
amount of the deferred premium on our interest rate caps that is being amortized to interest expense. Partially offsetting the interest expense increase was the impact of the settlement of legacy 2015 Notes during September 2015. 
Other Income 
Other income for Fiscal 2016 was $10.4 million, compared with $69.7 million for Fiscal 2015. Our other income may be analyzed as

 Other income in Fiscal 2015 included significant currency transaction gains related to Gates euro debt,
prior to its designation as a net investment hedge during the first quarter of 2015.  Income Tax (Expense) Benefit 
During Fiscal 2016, the income tax expense attributable to continuing operations was $21.1 million on a profit before tax of
$92.9 million compared to an income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $9.2 million on a profit before tax of $41.5 million in Fiscal 2015. 
Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2016 was lower than our statutory rate of 35% as a result of our geographical mix of earnings, manufacturing
incentives, and company owned life insurance adjustments of $43.4 million. These reductions in the rate were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings, tax law changes, and valuation allowances of $32.9 million. 
Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 was lower than our statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of our geographical mix of earnings,
which included a $26.0 million benefit from non-operating gains of $74.2 million not subject to taxation. In addition, our rate was reduced by manufacturing incentives, company owned life insurance, tax law changes, and the release of uncertain tax
positions of $32.2 million. These reductions in the rate were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings and valuation allowances of $35.4 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2016 was $594.9 million, an increase of 8.7%, or $47.7 million, compared with $547.2 million for
Fiscal 2015. The underlying increase was due largely to productivity improvements (in particular procurement sourcing initiatives of $29.1 million), higher pricing of $28.3 million, lower SG&A spend of $12.3 million and the impact of
higher volumes of $10.8 million. Partially offsetting these improvements was the unfavorable impact of movements in average foreign currency exchange rates of $14.2 million, labor inflation of $14.0 million and unfavorable product mix
of $3.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.7% for Fiscal 2016, a 180 basis point improvement compared with the margin of 19.9% for Fiscal 2015 due to increased productivity and higher prices in Fiscal 2016.

$52.5 million, compared with net sales during Fiscal 2015 of $1,809.6 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $43.6 million, net sales increased by 5.3%, or $96.1 million, compared
with Fiscal 2015. This was driven by higher sales volumes of $72.4 million and the impact of pricing actions of $13.8 million.  The volume
increase was driven primarily by our automotive end market, which accounted for 62.3% of our Power Transmission Fiscal 2016 sales. Approximately 65% of this volume growth was from the replacement channels, driving core growth of 10.4% in the
automotive end market. China in particular performed well as our businesses benefitted from government automotive stimulus programs as well as market share gains. This was partially offset by lower volumes to Power Transmissions industrial end
markets, split equally between the replacement and first-fit channels. The general industrials end market drove the majority of this decline, with most other industrial end markets remaining flat or just
slightly down from the prior year period. In addition to the net increase in volumes, sales benefitted from favorable pricing actions of $13.8 million, primarily from the replacement channels and particularly in North America. 
Fiscal 2016 cost of sales in Power Transmission was $1,127.8 million, an increase of 2.7% or $30.1 million, compared with
$1,097.7 million in Fiscal 2015. The gross margin of 39.4% for Fiscal 2016 was broadly flat compared with 39.3% in Fiscal 2015. The increase in cost of sales was driven primarily by higher volumes of approximately $47 million, and, to a
lesser degree, by inventory adjustments related primarily to our maintenance, repair and operations assets of $11.2 million, labor inflation of $9.2 million and unfavorable product mix of $7.0 million. Partially offsetting the overall cost
of sales increase was favorable movements in average currency translation rates of $15.8 million and productivity improvements of $9.2 million in Fiscal 2016 as compared with Fiscal 2015. 
Fiscal 2016 other operating expenses in Power Transmission was $511.7 million, compared with $546.0 million in Fiscal 2015. Other
operating expenses, primarily SG&A costs, decreased in Fiscal 2016 by $34.3 million compared with Fiscal 2015. This was driven primarily by a decrease in impairments recognized of $27.1 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015,
which related mostly to currency-driven impairment in Fiscal 2015 of the brands and trade name intangible asset. In addition, we incurred lower amortization of intangible assets of $8.5 million and lower operating SG&A spend of $8.1 million
due to labor cost reductions in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015.

 Our Power Transmission segment recognized operating income of $222.6 million for Fiscal
2016, compared with operating income of $165.9 million in Fiscal 2015. Operating income includes depreciation and amortization, which decreased during Fiscal 2016 by $15.8 million compared with the prior year period. Operating income also
includes the impairments, which decreased by $27.1 million compared with Fiscal 2015, driven by the impairment in Fiscal 2015 of the brands and trade names intangible asset. As these items are adjusted out of the segment measure of profitability,
Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in a year-over-year increase in operating income that is not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA
was $408.5 million for Fiscal 2016, an increase of 8.0%, or $30.2 million, compared with $378.3 million in Fiscal 2015. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by higher sales volumes ($25.8 million), favorable pricing
actions ($13.8 million), productivity improvements ($9.2 million) and lower SG&A spend ($8.1 million); partially offset by unfavorable movements in average foreign currency exchange rates ($9.9 million), inflation ($9.2 million) and unfavorable
product mix ($7.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 21.9% in Fiscal 2016, a 100 basis point improvement compared with 20.9% in Fiscal 2015 due to higher prices and productivity in Fiscal 2016.

 Net sales in Fluid Power in Fiscal 2016 were $884.9 million, a decrease of $50.6 million, or 5.4%,
compared with net sales in Fiscal 2015 of $935.5 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $24.1 million, net sales decreased by 2.8%, or $26.5 million. Volumes drove this decrease,
declining by almost 5% in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015, offset partially by favorable price impacts of $14.5 million.  Sales
volumes to the energy and transportation end markets, which together accounted for 24.1% of Fluid Powers Fiscal 2016 sales, declined by 14.4% and 7.4%, respectively. Oil and gas was the largest contributor to this decline, driven by falling
energy prices that affected our Middle East and Singapore operations in particular. The lower transportation sales were concentrated in heavy-duty truck and bus sales, which declined by 8.8% in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015, particularly in
the U.S. Partially offsetting the industrial volume declines were increased sales to the automotive end market, which comprised 19.7% of Fluid Powers Fiscal 2016 sales, and had growth of 5.7% in Fiscal 2016. This was driven by solid demand
from emerging European markets, benefiting volumes by approximately $14 million, and Western European sales of kits and waterpumps, which grew by approximately $19 million. Softening the overall decline in volumes were favorable pricing
actions of $14.5 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015, most of which came from the replacement channels.  Fiscal 2016
cost of sales in Fluid Power was $558.4 million, a decrease of 8.7% or $52.9 million, compared with $611.3 million in Fiscal 2015. The gross margin of 36.9% for Fiscal 2016 was up from 34.7% in Fiscal 2015. The decrease in cost of
sales was driven primarily by lower volumes of approximately $31 million, productivity improvements of $19.9 million, favorable impacts of $7.5 million from movements in average

currency exchange rates and favorable product mix of $3.4 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015. Partially offsetting the cost of sales decreases were inventory adjustments
related to our maintenance, repair and operations assets of $10.5 million, and labor inflation of $4.8 million as compared with Fiscal 2015. The 220 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by productivity improvements.
 Fiscal 2016 other operating expenses in Fluid Power was $250.3 million, compared with $305.7 million in Fiscal 2015. Other
operating expenses, primarily SG&A costs, decreased in Fiscal 2016 by $55.4 million compared with Fiscal 2015. This was driven primarily by a decrease in impairments recognized of $22.6 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015,
which related mostly to the currency-driven impairment in Fiscal 2015 of the brands and trade name intangible. In addition, Gates recognized $8.1 million lower amortization of acquired intangible assets, $10.6 million lower selling and
distribution costs and incurred lower operating SG&A spend of $4.2 million due to headcount reductions during Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015. 
Our Fluid Power segment recognized operating income of $76.2 million for Fiscal 2016, compared with operating income of
$18.5 million in Fiscal 2015. Operating income includes depreciation and amortization, which decreased during Fiscal 2016 by $13.8 million compared with the prior year period. Operating income also includes the impairments, which decreased by
$22.6 million compared with Fiscal 2015, driven by the impairment in Fiscal 2015 of an indefinite-lived brands and trade names intangible that was recognized as part of the purchase accounting at the time of the Acquisition. As these items are
adjusted out of the segment measure of profitability, Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in a year-over-year increase in operating income that is not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $186.4 million, an increase of 10.4% or $17.5 million, compared with $168.9 million in Fiscal 2015. The
increase in Adjusted EBITDA was driven primarily by productivity improvements ($19.9 million), favorable pricing actions ($14.5 million), lower SG&A spend ($4.2 million) and favorable product mix ($3.4 million); partially offset by lower
sales volumes ($15.0 million), inflation ($4.8 million) and unfavorable movements in average foreign currency exchange rates ($4.2 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.1% in Fiscal 2016, a 300 basis point improvement compared with
18.1% in Fiscal 2015 driven by a 220 basis point improvement in gross margins discussed above.  Fiscal 2015 Results Compared with Full Year 2014
Results  As the Company had and has no interest in any operations other than those of Pinafore Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries,
comparison of the results of the Post-Acquisition Predecessor with those of the Pre-Acquisition Predecessor is impacted only by the effects of the accounting for, and the financing of, the Acquisition. For the
purposes of facilitating the discussion of Fiscal 2015 with the full year period ended January 3, 2015, we have therefore aggregated the Pre-Acquisition Predecessor and Post-Acquisition Predecessor
periods of 2014 (Full Year 2014) as a comparable period to Fiscal 2015. In addition, we identify in the discussion where applicable the impact of the purchase accounting related to the Acquisition and the financing of the Acquisition.

 Net Sales 
Net sales in Fiscal 2015 were $2,745.1 million, a decrease of $297.1 million, or 9.8%, compared with net sales during Full Year 2014 of
$3,042.2 million. Our net sales for Fiscal 2015 were adversely impacted by 
   79 




Table of Contents

 
movements in average currency exchange rates of $253.6 million compared with Full Year 2014, due in particular to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro ($109 million), Mexican
Peso ($27 million) and Brazilian Real ($25 million). Excluding this impact, net sales decreased by $43.5 million, or 1.4%, in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014. This decrease was driven by lower volumes ($74.1 million), partially offset
by higher sales prices ($24.6 million).  The volume decline was driven primarily by a decrease of $110.1 million in Fluid Power
sales volumes, offset partially by an increase of $35.9 million in volumes in our Power Transmission business. Sales to the energy, agriculture and construction end markets declined by 11.3%, 12.5% and 5.0%, respectively. This industrial end
market weakness was the result of falling energy prices and a global softening in industrial demand, particularly in developed markets such as Europe and North America. Sales into the transportation end market, particularly in Power Transmission,
provided some resilience from these industrial headwinds. Also partially offsetting the overall volume declines was solid growth in the automotive end market, driven by a 4.8% growth in sales in Europe. Approximately $15 million of the pricing
gains arose from our Power Transmission business, with the remaining approximately $10 million coming from Fluid Power sales. In both segments, the pricing was driven almost entirely by sales to the replacement channels. 
Cost of Sales 
Cost of sales in Fiscal 2015 were $1,709.0 million, a decrease of 15.2% or $306.2 million, compared with $2,015.2 million in
Full Year 2014. The decrease was driven by purchase accounting adjustments related to the uplift of inventory balances of $121.4 million in Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, as well as favorable foreign exchange rate movements of approximately
$113 million. Also contributing to the decrease were productivity improvements of $35.5 million. Lower production volumes contributed a further $44.3 million of the decrease in cost of sales from Full Year 2014 to Fiscal 2015.
Partially offsetting these decreases were higher depreciation costs of $11.8 million (due primarily to purchase accounting adjustments), labor inflation of $8.3 million and unfavorable product mix of $3.1 million arising from a shift
in the relative margins of products sold.  Gross Profit 
The gross profit for Fiscal 2015 was $1,036.1 million, up 0.9% or $9.1 million, compared with $1,027.0 million in Full Year
2014. Our gross profit margin for Fiscal 2015 was 37.7%, up from 33.8% in Full Year 2014, due principally to the 2014 purchase accounting adjustments associated with inventory and fixed asset uplifts. Excluding these two purchase accounting impacts,
our Full Year 2014 gross profit margin would have been 37.9%. The remaining change in the gross profit margin is attributable primarily to the impact of lower sales volumes compared with Full Year 2014 on a partially fixed cost base. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
Total SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2015 were $784.5 million, a decrease of 3.8% or $31.2 million, compared with $815.7 million in
Full Year 2014. SG&A expenses were comprised primarily of selling and distribution costs, administrative costs, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and R&D costs. 
Selling and distribution costs, which tend to move in proportion to sales, were $305.6 million in Fiscal 2015, compared with
$338.8 million in Full Year 2014, a decrease of $33.2 million. Selling and distribution costs as a percentage of sales in Fiscal 2015 were flat at 11.1% compared with the prior year, as labor-related inflation costs were offset by
headcount reductions.  The remainder of the SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2015 were $478.9 million, compared with $476.9 million
in Full Year 2014, an increase of $2.0 million. The increase was due principally to a $15.2 million rise in the amortization charge related to the step-up of intangible assets as part of purchase
accounting in the prior year (the acquired intangible asset amortization increased from approximately $146 million in Full Year 2014 to 
   80

approximately $161 million in Fiscal 2015). Partially offsetting these increases were the impacts from labor savings of approximately $15 million, largely resulting from the realignment of
our expense base globally and by function.  Transaction-Related Costs 
Transaction-related costs in Fiscal 2015 were $0.7 million, compared with $194.6 million during Full Year 2014. In both periods,
these expenses related primarily to costs recognized primarily in respect of the Acquisition, including advisory fees, change of control costs relating to share based compensation awards and the accelerated vesting of such awards, and payments due
to holders of share awards and options to compensate those holders for the loss in value of their interests due to the distribution of certain non-core assets to the Companys indirect owners. In Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, transaction-related costs also included fees incurred to position the Company, at that time, for an asset sale or to become a public company. 
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Assets 
For Fiscal 2015, we recognized impairments of $51.1 million, including $44.0 million in relation to the U.S. dollar denominated
indefinite-lived brands and trade names intangible, that was recognized as part of the purchase accounting at the time of the Acquisition. The impairment arose due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which the sales
supporting the value of this asset were denominated. A further impairment of $6.7 million was recognized in relation to property, plant and equipment in Brazil, as a result of the challenging trading conditions in that region, which have been
exacerbated by the significant devaluation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.  For the Full Year 2014, we recognized
impairments of $0.6 million, relating primarily to the discontinuation of a select software system.  Restructuring Expenses
 During Fiscal 2015, we recognized restructuring expenses of $15.6 million, which related primarily to severance expenses
incurred across both segments as part of the right-sizing of our operations and the streamlining of our global corporate cost functions. 
During Full Year 2014, restructuring expenses of $22.0 million were recognized, of which $18.4 million related to the closure of the
Ashe County plant within the United States. Also during Full Year 2014, $1.8 million of severance and related costs were incurred in relation to the closure of the London corporate center. 
Other Operating Income (Expense) 
During Fiscal 2015, we recognized income of $0.2 million, primarily in relation to the closure of a European facility in a prior period.
 During Full Year 2014, we recognized income of $5.5 million, primarily in relation to sales of land and buildings in Mexico and the
United States.  Operating Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations 
Operating income from continuing operations in Fiscal 2015 was $184.4 million, compared with a loss of $0.4 million in Full Year 2014.
This loss was driven primarily by the transaction-related costs incurred in connection with the Acquisition.

 Details of our debt are presented in note 17 of our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this prospectus. Interest expense includes the amortization of issue costs incurred in relation to the borrowings.  The
increase in interest expense during Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014 was due largely to the new debt structure entered into on July 3, 2014 as a part of the Acquisition financing, partially offset by the impact of the settlement of
legacy debt during Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014.  Other Income 
Other income for Fiscal 2015 was $69.7 million, compared with other income of $48.5 million for Full Year 2014. Our other income may

 Other income in both periods included significant currency transaction gains related to our new euro debt,
prior to its designation as a net investment hedge during the first quarter of 2015. In Full Year 2014, this gain was partially offset by bridge financing commitment fees of $17.1 million incurred in relation to the Acquisition.

 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
During Fiscal 2015, the income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations was $9.2 million on a profit before tax of
$41.5 million compared to an income tax benefit attributable to continuing operations of $51.9 million on a loss before tax of $125.0 million during Full Year 2014. 
Our effective tax rate for Fiscal 2015 was lower than our statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of our geographical mix of earnings,
which included a $26.0 million benefit from non-operating gains of $74.2 million not subject to taxation. In addition, our rate was reduced by manufacturing incentives, company owned life insurance, tax law changes, and the release of uncertain tax
positions of $32.2 million. These reductions in the rate were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings and valuation allowances of $35.4 million. 
Our effective tax rate for Full Year 2014 was lower than our statutory rate of 35% as a result of our geographical mix of earnings, affected
primarily by the Acquisition, manufacturing incentives, company owned life insurance, and the release of uncertain tax positions of $105.3 million. These reductions in the rate were partially offset by U.S. tax on foreign earnings and non-deductible
acquisition-related transaction costs of $99.3 million.  Adjusted EBITDA 
Adjusted EBITDA for Fiscal 2015 was $547.2 million, a decrease of 6.1% or $35.7 million, compared with $582.9 million for Full
Year 2014. Unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $77.8 million. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.2% or $42.1 million in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014 due to
productivity improvements in cost of sales of $35.5 million, lower SG&A spend of $21.0 million and benefits from higher selling prices of $24.6 million. Partially offsetting the increases in Adjusted EBITDA was the impact of lower sales volumes
of $29.9 million incurred in Fiscal 2015. The Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9% for Fiscal 2015, a 70 basis point improvement compared with 19.2% for Full Year 2014.

 Net sales in Power Transmission in Fiscal 2015 were $1,809.6 million, decreased by $135.6 million, or
7.0%, compared with net sales during Full Year 2014 of $1,945.2 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $190.1 million, net sales increased by 2.8%, or $54.5 million,

compared to Full Year 2014. This was driven by higher sale volumes ($35.9 million) and favorable pricing actions ($14.7 million). Power Transmissions sales volumes into the automotive end
market, which grew by 5.8% during Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014, were split roughly equally between replacement and first-fit channels. Partially offsetting this growth was a decline in sales to the
agriculture and construction end markets, which decreased by 12.6% and 7.6%, respectively, particularly in North America, in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014. Favorable pricing actions of $14.7 million in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full
Year 2014, focused in the replacement channels, helped to further drive the overall growth.  Fiscal 2015 cost of sales in Power
Transmission was $1,097.7 million, a decrease of 10.9% or $133.7 million, compared with $1,231.4 million in Full Year 2014. The gross margin of 39.3% for Fiscal 2015 was up from 36.7% during Full Year 2014. The decrease in cost of
sales was driven primarily by favorable impacts of $84.5 million from movements in average currency exchange rates, the inventory uplift in 2014 relating to the purchase accounting in connection with the Acquisition (a
one-time increase to cost of sales in 2014 of $59.9 million) and productivity improvements in 2015 of $9.5 million. Partially offsetting the cost of sales decrease was the impact of higher volumes of
approximately $25 million. The 260 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by the inventory uplift in Full Year 2014 and productivity improvements in Fiscal 2015. 
Fiscal 2015 other operating expenses in Power Transmission was $546.0 million, a decrease of $112.8 million, or 17.1%, compared with
$658.8 million in Full Year 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by $128.6 million of lower transaction-related costs being incurred in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014, relating to the acquisition of Gates by Blackstone in
July 2014. Operating SG&A costs decreased due primarily to cost-saving initiatives ($13.4 million) and lower selling and distribution costs ($15.0 million). Share-based compensation costs were reduced during Fiscal 2015 by $5.3 million, due
to the closure of legacy share plans in 2014 and establishment of new plans following the acquisition of Gates by Blackstone. Partially offsetting the decrease was a currency driven impairment charge of $28.3 million recognized in Fiscal 2015
related to the brands and trade name intangible asset. Other operating expenses increased by $5.8 million due to the higher amortization charge on acquired intangible assets in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014. 
Our Power Transmission segment recognized operating income of $165.9 million for Fiscal 2015, compared with operating income for Full
Year 2014 of $55.0 million.  Adjusted EBITDA in Fiscal 2015 was $378.3 million, a decrease of $21.7 million, or 5.4%, compared
with $400.0 million in Full Year 2014. Unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $59.7 million. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.5% ($38.0 million) in Fiscal 2015 compared
with Full Year 2014, driven primarily by higher sales volumes ($11.0 million), favorable pricing actions ($14.7 million), lower SG&A spend ($13.4 million) and productivity improvements in cost of sales ($9.5 million), partially offset by
unfavorable product mix ($6.9 million) and inflation ($5.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 20.9% in Fiscal 2015 from 20.6% in Full Year 2014.

 Sales in Fluid Power in Fiscal 2015 were $935.5 million, a decrease of 14.7%, or $161.5 million,
compared with net sales in Full Year 2014 of $1,097.0 million. Excluding the adverse impact of movements in average currency exchange rates of $63.5 million, net sales decreased by 8.9%, or $98.0 million, compared with Full Year 2014.
This was driven by lower sales volumes ($110.1 million) offset partially by higher prices ($9.9 million). Volumes declined across all of our end markets in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014. Sales to the energy, general industrial and
agriculture end markets, which comprised over half of our Fiscal 2015 sales, declined by 13.3%, 13.3% and 12.4%, respectively. Fluid Power sales across all regions decreased during Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014, but demand was
particularly low in the U.S. Favorable pricing actions of $9.9 million, primarily in the replacement channels, somewhat offset these overall volume decreases. 
Fiscal 2015 cost of sales in Fluid Power was $611.3 million, a decrease of 22.0%, or $172.5 million, compared with $783.8 million in
Full Year 2014, with a Fiscal 2015 gross margin of 34.7% and a Full Year 2014 gross margin of 28.6%. The decrease in cost of sales was driven primarily by lower volumes of approximately $69 million, impacts of the inventory uplift in 2014 of
approximately $61 million, favorable movements in average currency exchange rates of $28.4 million, productivity improvements of $26.0 million and favorable mix of $3.8 million in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014. Partially
offsetting the cost of sales decreases were labor inflation of $3.0 million and higher depreciation of $7.0 million as compared with Full Year 2014. The 610 basis point improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by the inventory
uplift in 2014 and enhanced productivity in 2015.  Fiscal 2015 other operating expenses in Fluid Power was $305.7 million, a decrease
of 17.1%, or $62.9 million, compared with $368.6 million in Full Year 2014. This decrease was driven primarily by $65.3 million of lower transaction-related costs being incurred in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014, relating to the
acquisition of Gates by Blackstone in July 2014. Selling and distribution costs decreased by $18.2 million in Fiscal 2015 compared to Full Year 2014. Operating SG&A costs decreased by $7.6 million from Full Year 2014 to Fiscal 2015, due
primarily to labor cost reductions. Partially offsetting these decreases was a currency driven impairment charge of $23.5 million recognized in Fiscal 2015 related to the brands and trade name intangible asset. In addition, there was a
$9.4 million higher amortization charge on acquired intangible assets in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014.  Our Fluid Power
segment recognized operating income of $18.5 million for Fiscal 2015, compared with operating loss for Full Year 2014 of $55.4 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $168.9 million in Fiscal 2015, a decrease of 7.7%, or $14.0 million, compared with $182.9 million in Full Year
2014. Unfavorable movements in average currency exchange rates impacted Adjusted EBITDA by $18.1 million. Excluding foreign exchange impacts, Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.2% ($4.1 million) in Fiscal 2015 compared with Full Year 2014 driven primarily by
productivity improvements in

cost of sales ($26.0 million), favorable pricing actions ($9.9 million), less SG&A spend ($7.6 million) and favorable product mix ($3.8 million), partially offset by lower sales volumes
($40.9 million) and inflation ($3.0 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin consequently improved to 18.1% in Fiscal 2015 from 16.7% in Full Year 2014. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Treasury Responsibilities and Philosophy 
Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are for working capital, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, facility expansions
and acquisitions. We expect to finance our future cash requirements with cash on hand, cash flows from operations and, where necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facilities. We have historically relied on our cash flow from operations
and various debt and equity financings for liquidity.  Our central treasury function is responsible for procuring our financial resources
and maintaining an efficient capital structure, together with managing our liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. All treasury operations are conducted within strict policies and guidelines that are approved by the Board.
Compliance with those policies and guidelines is monitored by the regular reporting of treasury activities to the Board.  A key element of
our treasury philosophy is that funding, interest rate and currency decisions and the location of cash and debt balances are centrally managed. Our borrowing requirements are met by raising funds in the most favorable markets. Management may retain
a portion of net debt in the foreign currencies in which the net assets of our operations are denominated. The desired currency profile of net debt can be achieved by either sourcing debt in the foreign currency or entering into currency derivative
contracts.  From time to time, we enter into currency derivative contracts to manage currency transaction exposures. Similarly from time
to time we may enter into interest rate derivatives to maintain the desired mix of floating and fixed rate debt.  Our portfolio of cash
and cash equivalents is managed such that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution. Management monitors closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it holds deposits. Similar
considerations are given to our portfolio of derivative financial instruments.  Our borrowing facilities are monitored against forecast
requirements and timely action is taken to put in place, renew or replace credit lines. Managements policy is to manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources and by staggering the maturity of our debt. 
As market conditions warrant, we and our majority equity holders, Blackstone and its affiliates, may from time to time, depending upon market
conditions, seek to repurchase debt securities that we have issued or loans that we have borrowed in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our indebtedness, any such purchases may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions,
individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may relate to a substantial amount of a particular tranche of debt, with a corresponding reduction in the trading liquidity of that debt. In addition, any such purchases made at
prices below the adjusted issue price (as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) may result in taxable cancellation of indebtedness income to us, which amounts may be material, and result in related adverse tax consequences to us.
 It is our policy to retain sufficient liquidity throughout the capital expenditure cycle to maintain our financial flexibility. We do not
anticipate any material long-term deterioration in our overall liquidity position in

the foreseeable future. Management believes that the current level of working capital is sufficient for Gates present requirements. 
Cash Flow  Nine months ended September 30, 2017
compared to the nine months ended October 1, 2016:  Cash provided by operations was $142.6 million during the first nine months of
2017 compared with $200.4 million during the prior year period. Operating cash flow before movements in operating assets and liabilities was $259.5 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared with $235.1 million in the prior
year period, an increase of $24.4 million that was due largely to the improved operational performance of Gates. Movements in operating assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2017 gave rise to a decrease of $116.9 million
in cash generated from operations compared with $34.7 million decrease in the prior year period. This decrease, or further spend of cash, was driven primarily by the build of inventory and higher net trade receivable balances due to increased
production and sales volumes.  Net cash outflow from investing activities in the first nine months of 2017 was $99.8 million,
compared with the net cash outflow from investing activities of $36.0 million in the prior year period. In addition to a $21.7 million higher net capital expenditure, cash outflow from investing activities increased by $36.7 million due to
the purchase by Gates of Techflow Flexibles, a fully integrated engineering, manufacturing and commercial operation.  Net cash outflow
from financing activities was $58.2 million in the first nine months of 2017, compared with $94.6 million in the prior year period. The change in cash outflows from the first nine months of 2016 to that for the current year period was
driven primarily by an excess cash flow payment of $38.2 million to our term loan lenders made in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, dividend payments to non-controlling shareholders in the prior year period were $13.5 million higher
than in the first nine months of 2017. Partially offsetting these year-over-year decreases in financing cash outflows was $17.4 million of financing costs incurred in the first nine months of 2017 in relation to the debt refinancing in
March 2017.  Fiscal 2016 compared to Fiscal 2015: 
Cash provided by operations was $371.6 million in Fiscal 2016 compared with $275.9 million in Fiscal 2015. Operating cash flow
before movements in operating assets and liabilities was $279.9 million compared with $246.6 million in Fiscal 2015, an increase of $33.3 million that was due largely to the improvement in operational performance. Movements in
operating assets and liabilities during Fiscal 2016 gave rise to an increase of $91.7 million in cash generated from operations compared with $29.3 million in Fiscal 2015. This increase was driven primarily by the receipt of a tax refund
in the United States of $41.3 million related to returns filed in prior periods. In addition, accounts receivable increased during Fiscal 2016 compared with Fiscal 2015 as sales rose, partially offset by a decrease in inventory driven primarily
by more disciplined inventory management.  Net cash outflow from investing activities in Fiscal 2016 was $60.1 million, broadly flat
with the net cash outflow from investing activities of $60.5 million in Fiscal 2015. Capital expenditure was lower in Fiscal 2016 at $68.1 million, compared with $85.8 million in Fiscal 2015, however Fiscal 2015 benefited from a
decrease in restricted cash of $25.6 million (primarily related to the repayment of legacy debt with escrowed cash) compared with $2.7 million during Fiscal 2016. 
Net cash outflow from financing activities was $110.8 million in Fiscal 2016, compared with an outflow of $73.9 million in
Fiscal 2015. This was driven by $14.8 million higher repayment of debt in Fiscal 2016, primarily related to the Excess Cash Flow payment of $38.2 million made in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, dividend payments to non-controlling shareholders in Fiscal 2016 were $10.8 million higher than in Fiscal 2015.

 As a result of the decreased debt, cash interest paid decreased to $198.8 million in Fiscal
2016 from $208.0 million in Fiscal 2015.  Fiscal 2015 compared to Full Year 2014: 
Cash provided by operations was $275.9 million in Fiscal 2015 compared with $81.5 million in Full Year 2014. Operating cash flow
before movements in operating assets and liabilities was $246.6 million compared with $8.8 million in Full Year 2014, an increase of $237.8 million that was due largely to the impact of transaction-related costs in Full Year 2014.
Movements in operating assets and liabilities during Fiscal 2015 gave rise to an increase of $29.3 million in cash generated from operations compared with $72.7 million in Full Year 2014, although
Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014 included a $121.4 million decrease in inventory as a result of the inventory uplift associated with purchase accounting. 
Net cash outflow from investing activities in Fiscal 2015 was $60.5 million, compared with a net cash outflow from investing activities
of $3,801.7 million in Full Year 2014, driven by the Acquisition. Capital expenditure was lower in Fiscal 2015 at $85.8 million, compared with $103.2 million in Full Year 2014. 
Net cash outflow from financing activities was $73.9 million in Fiscal 2015, compared with an inflow of $3,742.3 million in Full
Year 2014. This was driven by an investment by Blackstone in 2014 of $1.6 billion and the draw down of $4.1 billion of new debt to finance the Acquisition, partially offset by the repayment of the majority of the outstanding Pre-Acquisition Predecessor debt. As a result of the decreased debt, cash interest paid increased to $208.0 million in Fiscal 2015 from $116.0 million in Full Year 2014. 
Indebtedness  As of September 30, 2017,

 Details of our borrowings, together with a reconciliation of their carrying amount to their principal amount,
are presented in note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.  During March and April
2017, we completed several refinancing transactions to re-price the Euro Term Loans, extend the maturities of certain debt tranches and to change the currency and interest structure of our debt.

An additional $150.0 million was raised as dollar notes in March 2017 and, in April 466.2 million was raised under the Euro Term Loan facility. The proceeds from these debt
raisings were used to repay $650.0 million of the existing Dollar Term Loans.  Dollar and Euro Term Loans 
Our secured credit facilities include a Dollar Term Loan credit facility and a Euro Term Loan credit facility that were drawn on July 3,
2014. For the Dollar Term Loan the interest rate as of September 30, 2017 was LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, plus a margin of 3.25% and borrowings under the Dollar Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 4.58% per annum. As of September 30, 2017,
Euro Term Loan borrowings incurred interest at Euro LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0%, plus a margin of 3.50% and borrowings under the Euro Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum. In November 2017, we refinanced our Term Loans such that
each of the applicable margins were lowered by 0.25%, in each case subject to an additional step-down of 0.25% following a qualifying initial public offering. As part of the April 2017 refinancing transaction, the maturity dates for both of the term
loan facilities were extended from July 3, 2021 to March 31, 2024, with a springing maturity of April 15, 2022 if more than $500 million of the dollar notes remain outstanding at that time. 
Both term loans are subject to quarterly amortization payments of 0.25%, based on the original principal amount less certain prepayments with
the balance payable on maturity. During the first nine months of 2017, we made quarterly amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan of $15.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively. During Fiscal 2016, we made
quarterly amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan of $24.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. 
Under the terms of the credit agreement, we are obliged to offer annually to the term loan lenders, commencing in 2016, an excess cash
flow amount as defined under the agreement, based on the preceding years final results. Based on the Fiscal 2016 results, we did not need to make an excess cash flow payment as our leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement has
dropped below the threshold above which payments are required.  During the first nine months of 2017, a transactional foreign exchange
loss of $80.0 million was recognized in respect of the Euro Term Loan, compared with a loss of $6.2 million in the prior year period. Of these losses, $50.3 million was recognized in other (expense) income in the first nine months of
2017 and $0 in the prior year period, and a $29.7 million loss was recognized in other comprehensive income in the first nine months of 2017 in respect of the Euro Term Loan as part of this facility has been designated as a net investment hedge
of certain of Gates euro investments. In the prior year period, a loss of $6.2 million was recognized in other comprehensive income. 
During Fiscal 2016, a transactional foreign exchange gain of $8.7 million was recognized in respect of the Euro Term Loan, compared with
a gain of $23.6 million in Fiscal 2015. Of these gains, $0 million was recognized in other (expense) income in Fiscal 2016 and $31.0 million in Fiscal 2015, and an $8.7 million gain was recognized in other comprehensive income in
Fiscal 2016 due to the designation of this facility as a net investment hedge of certain of our euro investments. In Fiscal 2015, a loss of $7.4 million was recognized in other comprehensive income. 
As of September 30, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under the Dollar Term Loan was $1,733.7 million and the Euro Term Loan was
$771.0 million (655.2 million).  Unsecured Senior Notes 
As of September 30, 2017, Gates had outstanding $1,190.0 million dollar notes and $276.5 million (235.0 million) euro
notes (collectively, the Notes). This includes $150 million of dollar notes that were issued on March 30, 2017 as part of the broader refinancing transaction (see Refinancing below for further details). The
Notes are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2022. The dollar notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 6% and the euro notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 5.75%. Interest payments are made semi-annually.

 During the first nine months of 2017, a transactional foreign exchange loss of $30.8 million
was recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the euro notes as these notes had been designated as a net investment hedge of certain of Gates euro investments. During the prior year period, a loss of $7.4 million loss was
recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the euro notes. In Fiscal 2016 the principal on the euro notes was impacted by $10.6 million of favorable foreign exchange rates, compared with gains of $28.0 million in Fiscal 2015.
 On and after July 15, 2017, we may redeem the Notes, at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date:

 In the event of a change of control over the Company, each holder will have the right to require us to
repurchase all of such holders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, except to the extent that we have previously elected to redeem the
Notes (under the terms outlined above).  Revolving Credit Facility 
Gates has a secured revolving credit facility that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate principal amount of
$125.0 million, with a letter of credit sub-facility of $20.0 million. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were $0 drawings for cash under the revolving credit facility and
there were no letters of credit outstanding.  Debt under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate, which can be
either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at our option, LIBOR plus an applicable margin. 
Asset-Backed Revolver 
Gates has a revolving credit facility backed by certain of its assets in North America. The facility allows for loans of up to a maximum of
$325.0 million ($321.7 million as of September 30, 2017 and $288.6 million as of December 31, 2016, based on the values of the secured assets on those dates) with a letter of credit
sub-facility of $150.0 million. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were $0 drawings for cash under the asset-backed revolver. Debt under the facility bears interest at a floating
rate, which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at our option, LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The letters of credit outstanding under the asset-backed revolver were $57.0 million and
$54.3 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

 Refinancing 
During March and April 2017, we completed several refinancing transactions to re-price the Euro Term
Loans, extend the maturities of certain debt tranches and to raise additional debt to repay existing debt. In March 2017, $150.0 million of new dollar notes was issued and in April an additional 466.2 million was borrowed under the
Euro Term Loan facility. The proceeds from these transactions were used in April 2017 to repay $650.0 million of the existing Dollar Term Loan, keeping the refinancing transactions leverage neutral. A summary of the transactions and their
effective closing dates are set out below:

 The majority of the costs related to the refinancing transactions will be deferred and amortized to net income
over the remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method. In the first nine months of 2017, $15.4 million of refinancing costs were deferred on the balance sheet. Those refinancing costs that do not qualify for deferral
are recognized in net income as they are incurred. In the first nine months of 2017, $2.0 million of refinancing costs were recognized in net income as transaction-related costs. 
Net Debt  During
the first nine months of 2017, our net debt increased by $78.0 million from $3,308.1 million as of December 31, 2016 to $3,386.1 million at September 30, 2017. We generated cash from operating activities of $142.6 million,
offset by capital expenditures of $64.7 million and business acquisition costs of $36.7 million, which related to the purchase of Techflow Flexibles during June 2017. During the first nine months of 2017, in connection with the refinancing
of our debt, we paid financing costs of $17.4 million. Dividend payments to minority shareholders in our joint ventures (primarily Nitta Corporation) were $17.9 million. 
Movements in foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of $91.1 million on net debt during the first nine months of 2017, the majority
of the movement relating to the impact of movements in the euro against the U.S. dollar on our euro-denominated debt.  During Fiscal 2016,
our net debt decreased by $259.3 million from $3,567.4 million as of January 2, 2016 to $3,308.1 million at December 31, 2016. We generated cash from operating activities of $371.6 million, offset partially by capital
expenditures of $68.1 million and dividend payments of $38.9 million to minority shareholders in our joint ventures (primarily Nitta Corporation).

Fiscal 2016, the majority of the movement relating to the impact of movements in the euro against the U.S. dollar on our euro-denominated debt. 
Borrowing Headroom 
As of September 30, 2017, our asset-backed revolving credit facility had a borrowing base of $321.7 million, being the maximum amount the
Company can draw down based on the current value of the secured assets. The facility was undrawn for cash but there were letters of credit outstanding against the facility amounting to $57.0 million. We also have a secured revolving credit
facility that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million. We had drawn $0.6 million against uncommitted borrowing facilities (bank overdrafts) and had outstanding performance bonds,
letters of credit and bank guarantees amounting to $3.3 million (in addition to those outstanding under the revolving credit facility). 
Overall, therefore, our committed borrowing headroom was $385.8 million, in addition to cash balances of $530.0 million (including
restricted cash of $1.6 million).  Cash Balances 
Our central treasury function is responsible for maximizing the return on surplus cash balances within the constraints of our liquidity and
credit policy. We achieve this, where possible, by controlling directly all surplus cash balances and pooling arrangements on an ongoing basis and by reviewing the efficiency of all other cash balances across our businesses on a weekly basis. Our
policy is to apply funds from one part of Gates to meet the obligations of another part wherever possible, in order to ensure maximum efficiency in the use of our funds. No material restrictions apply that limit the application of this policy. We
currently intend that earnings by foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested in foreign jurisdictions in order to fund strategic initiatives (such as investment, expansion and acquisitions), fund working capital requirements and repay debt
(both third-party and intercompany) of our foreign subsidiaries in the normal course of business.  We manage our cash balances such that
there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution. We monitor closely the quality of the institutions that hold our deposits. As of December 31, 2016, 91.8% of our cash balances were held with
institutions rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poors and P-1 by Moodys, compared with 85.6% as of January 2, 2016. 
As of December 31, 2016, our total cash and investments were $528.8 million (including restricted cash), compared with
$340.2 million as of January 2, 2016, of which $337.5 million was interest-earning, compared with $249.4 million as of January 2, 2016. All interest-earning deposits attract interest at floating rates. Of the total cash and
investments balances, $300.3 million and $105.5 million was invested in short-term deposits by our Treasury department as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. $1.6 million and $4.5 million comprised
restricted cash as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively, primarily $1.4 million and $2.0 million held in escrow for insurance purposes as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. As of
January 2, 2016, an additional $1.8 million was held in escrow for legacy debt purposes.  A further $96.5 million and
$108.4 million of the total cash and investments balance was held in our non-wholly owned Asian subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, respectively. The remaining total cash
and investments balances of $130.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $121.8 million as of January 2, 2016 were held in centrally-controlled pooling arrangements and with local operating companies. As of December 31, 2016,
$345.5 million of our cash balance was under the direct control of Gates Treasury, compared with $143.9 million as of January 2, 2016.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement that is considered to be an
off-balance sheet arrangement that is required to be disclosed other than operating lease commitments.  Tabular
Disclosure of Contractual Obligations  Our consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments are summarized in the
following table which includes aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 and the periods in which payments are due, based on the earliest date on which we could be required to settle the liabilities. 
Floating interest payments and payments and receipts on interest rate derivatives are estimated based on market interest rates prevailing at
the balance sheet date. Amounts in respect of operating leases and purchase obligations are items that we are obligated to pay in the future, but they are not required to be included on the consolidated balance sheet.

During March and April 2017, Gates completed several refinancing transactions to re-price the Euro Term Loans, extend the maturities of certain debt tranches and to raise additional debt to repay existing debt. In March
2017, $150.0 million of new dollar notes was raised and an additional 466.2 million was raised under the Euro Term Loan facility. The proceeds from these transactions were used in April 2017 to repay $650.0 million of the existing Dollar Term
Loan, keeping the refinancing transactions leverage neutral.  The result of this refinancing on the annual expected principal
and interest payments is not significant; however, the extension of the maturities of certain of the debt tranches has changed the interest expected to be paid in after five years to $291.3 million. In addition, this extension has decreased the
expected principal payments in years three through five from $2,519.4 million to $48.6 million and increased the expected principal payments after five years from $1,285.7 million to $3,750.8 million. 
In November 2017, we refinanced our Term Loans such that each of the applicable margins were lowered by 0.25%, in each case subject to a
step-down of 0.25% following a qualifying initial public offering.

Future interest payments include payments on fixed and floating rate debt.

Post-retirement benefit obligations represent our expected cash contributions to its defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans in 2017. It is not practicable to present expected cash contributions
for subsequent years because they are determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.

A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us and that specifies all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be
purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. 
Non-GAAP Measures 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income or loss for the period before the impact of
income taxes, net finance costs, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is widely used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the profitability of companies. EBITDA eliminates potential differences in performance
caused by variations in capital structures (affecting net finance costs), tax positions (such as the availability of net operating losses against which to relieve taxable profits), the cost and age of tangible assets (affecting relative depreciation
expense) and the extent to which intangible assets are identifiable (affecting relative amortization expense).  Management uses Adjusted
EBITDA as its key profitability measure. This is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA before certain items that impact comparison of the performance of our businesses either period-over-period or with other businesses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as
our measure of segment profitability to assess the performance of our businesses and it is used for total Gates as well because we believe it is important to consider our profitability on a basis that is consistent with that of our operating
segments. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA should, therefore, be made available to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the performance of our businesses. 
During the periods presented, the items excluded from EBITDA in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA primarily included: 
 


 

 
the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory held by Gates at the date of the Acquisition;   


 

 
the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation;   


 

 
transaction-related costs incurred in business combinations and major corporate transactions;   


 

 
impairments, comprising impairments of goodwill and significant impairments or write downs of other assets;   


 

 
net interest relating to post-retirement benefit obligations, significant lump-sum settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses; 
 


 

 
restructuring costs;   


 

 
the net gain or loss on disposals and on the exit of businesses; and   


 

 
fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services. 
Differences exist among our businesses and from period to period in the extent to which their respective employees receive share-based
compensation or a charge for such compensation is recognized. Similarly, non-cash net interest relating to post-retirement benefit obligations, significant lump-sum
settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses may cause differences between our businesses and from period to period when comparing performance. We therefore exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the non-cash charges in relation to share-based compensation and the above adjustments related to post-retirement benefits in order to assess the relative performance of our businesses.

 We exclude from Adjusted EBITDA those acquisition-related costs that are required to be expensed
in accordance with ASC 805 Business Combinations, in particular, the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory held by Gates at the date of the Acquisition, and costs associated with major corporate
transactions because we do not believe that they relate to our performance. Other items are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA because they are individually or collectively significant items that are not considered to be representative of the performance
of our businesses. During the periods presented we excluded restructuring costs that reflect specific actions taken by management to improve Gates future profitability; the net gain or loss on disposals of assets other than in the ordinary
course of operations and gains and losses incurred in relation to non-Gates businesses disposed of in prior periods; and impairments of goodwill and significant impairments of other assets, representing the
excess of their carrying amounts over the amounts that are expected to be recovered from them in the future.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
exclude items that can have a significant effect on our profit or loss and should, therefore, be used in conjunction with, not as substitutes for, profit or loss for the period. Management compensates for these limitations by separately monitoring
net income from continuing operations for the period.  The following table reconciles the net income (loss), the most directly comparable
GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage
of sales. We use Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success of our businesses in managing our cost base and improving profitability.

 Net Debt 
Management uses net debt, rather than the narrower measure of net cash and cash equivalents which forms the basis for the consolidated cash
flow statement, as a measure of our liquidity and in assessing the strength of our balance sheet.  Management analyzes the key cash flow
items driving the movement in net debt to better understand that from period to period and to assess the cash performance and utilization of Gates in order to maximize the efficiency with which resources are allocated. The analysis of cash movements
in net debt also allows management to more clearly identify the level of cash generated from operations that remains available for distribution after servicing our debt and post-employment benefit obligations and after the cash impacts of
acquisitions and disposals.  Net debt represents the net total of: 
 


 

 
the carrying amount of our debt (bank overdrafts and bank and other loans); and   


 

 
the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash.  Net debt may be

 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments 
Details of our significant accounting policies are set out in note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in
this prospectus. 
   96 




Table of Contents

 When applying our accounting policies, management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates
concerning the future that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the disclosure of contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognized during the
accounting period. Management makes these assumptions, estimates and judgments based on factors such as historical experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which we operate and information available from our customers and other
outside sources. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions, estimates and judgments, the actual outcomes could be different. An analysis of the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a
significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of Gates assets and liabilities within the next fiscal year is presented below. 
Net Sales  We
derive our net sales primarily from the sale of a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications, both in the aftermarket and first-fit channels, throughout the
world.  Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the invoiced amount net of estimated returns, early settlement discounts, rebates
and sales tax and is recognized only when: (i) there is persuasive evidence of a sales agreement, typically in the form of a written sale or purchase agreement approved by both parties, (ii) the delivery of goods has occurredthis generally
occurs upon passage of title which, depending on the arrangement with the customer, is typically upon release of the goods from the physical control of the Company or upon receipt of the goods by the customer and, where there are contractual
acceptance provisions, when the customer has accepted the goods (or the right to reject them has lapsed); (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the collectability of revenue is reasonably assured. 
Although the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there may, at times, be agreements with customers that
contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, judgment is required to determine the appropriate accounting for transactions under these agreements, including whether the
specified deliverables should be treated as separate units of accounting for recognition purposes, and, if so, how the sales price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize sales for each element. For delivered elements, sales are
generally recognized only when the delivered elements have standalone value and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance. Sales for service contracts generally are recognized as the services are provided. 
Where a customer has the right to return goods, future returns are estimated based on historical returns profiles. Settlement discounts that
may apply to unpaid invoices are estimated based on the settlement histories of the relevant customers and projected market conditions in the various markets we serve. Rebates that may apply to issued invoices are estimated based on expected total
qualifying sales to the relevant customers.  Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits 
We operate pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of our employees. Pension benefits are provided by way of both defined
contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants. We also provide other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance coverage, to certain of our employees in North America
by way of unfunded defined benefit plans.  We account for post-employment benefits in accordance with GAAP, whereby the cost of defined
benefit plans is determined based on actuarial valuations of the plans that are carried out annually at our balance sheet date. The actuarial valuations are dependent on assumptions about the future that are made by management on the advice of
independent qualified actuaries.  If actual experience differs from these assumptions, there could be a material change in the amounts
recognized by us in respect of defined benefit plans in the next financial year. 
   97 




Table of Contents

 As of December 31, 2016, the present value of these obligations was $1,156.8 million
compared with $1,169.6 million as of January 2, 2016. The benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions including future salary increases, increases to pension benefits, mortality rates and, in the case of
post-employment medical benefits, the expected rate of increase in medical costs. The present value of the benefit obligations are calculated by discounting the benefit obligation using market yields on high-quality corporate bonds at the balance
sheet date. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the pension plan assets was $1,018.0 million, compared with $1,040.3 million as of January 2, 2016. 
The plan assets consist largely of listed securities and their fair values are subject to fluctuation in response to changes in market
conditions.  Effects of changes in the actuarial assumptions underlying the benefit obligation, effects of changes in the discount rate
applicable to the benefit obligation and effects of differences between the expected and actual return on the plan assets are classified as actuarial gains and losses and are recognized in other comprehensive income. During Fiscal 2016, we
recognized a net actuarial loss of $9.2 million. Further actuarial gains and losses will be recognized during the next financial year. 
We estimate that a 0.5% decrease in market interest rates would increase our benefit obligation by 5.7%, or $65.4 million. Only 1.6% of
the benefit obligation of $1,156.8 million as of December 31, 2016 is exposed to future salary increases. We estimate that a 0.50% increase in the salary scale would increase the benefit obligation by $1.0 million. Unless the benefit
obligation is subject to a buy-out or buy-in, it is not practical to mitigate the effects of mortality risk. We estimate that if a
one-year setback in mortality on the projected benefit obligation was measured, the benefit obligation would increase by 2.5%, or $28.8 million. 
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point
change in the assumed health care cost trend rate as of December 31, 2016 would have the following effects:

 An analysis of the assumptions that will be used by management to determine the cost of defined benefit plans
that will be recognized in income or loss in the next financial year is presented in note 18 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
Impairment of Goodwill and Other Long-Lived Assets 
Goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. Additionally, goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an annual impairment test. 
Goodwill  To identify a potential
impairment of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated is compared with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the
reporting unit is not considered impaired.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including the goodwill, exceeds its fair value,
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step 
   98 




Table of Contents

 
of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of
the reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of the impairment test. An impairment loss is recognized if and to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. 
Impairment tests were carried out on the goodwill balances as of the fiscal year end. Management based the fair value calculations on a
weighted blend of the income and market approaches. The income approach was based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent 2017 financial plans approved by the Board, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth
rates, selling prices and changes in direct costs. Forecasts for the following two years were based on region-specific growth assumptions determined by management, taking into account strategic initiatives. 
Cash flows for the years beyond this period for the reporting units to which individually significant amounts of goodwill were allocated were
projected to grow at compound annual growth rates reflecting annual decreases over the next seven years from the 2019 growth rates to the terminal growth rate. For Gates as a whole, this growth rate was 4.8%. The terminal growth rate for all
reporting units was set at 2.5%, a rate that does not exceed the expected long-term growth rates in the respective principal end markets. 
Management applied discount rates to the resulting cash flow projections that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money
and the risks specific to the reporting unit. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model. The discount rates used in the impairment tests of goodwill were in a range of 10.0% to 13.5% (January 2, 2016: in a
range of 10.0% to 16.0%).  For all reporting units, the fair values exceeded the carrying values and did not necessitate the second step
of the impairment test. Based on the assessments performed, no goodwill impairments were recognized during Fiscal 2016 or Fiscal 2015.  We
base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine
the carrying values for each of our reporting units tested. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years. 
Indefinite-Lived Assets Other than Goodwill 
To identify a potential impairment of indefinite-lived assets other than goodwill, the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying
amount. If the fair value of the indefinite-lived asset exceeds its carrying amount, it is not considered impaired. Fair value is calculated based on the anticipated net cash inflows and outflows related to the indefinite-lived asset. 
Fair value for our indefinite-lived brands and trade names intangible asset is determined using a relief from royalty valuation methodology in
which the key assumptions included sales growth rates and an estimated royalty rate. Sales forecasts were determined on the same basis as those used for the annual impairment testing of goodwill (refer above). 
Management applied discount rates to the calculated royalty savings that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to each region in which those royalty savings arose. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model adjusted for a premium to reflect the higher risk specific to the nature of the intangible asset.
The discount rates used in determining the December 31, 2016 fair value of the brands and trade names intangible were in a range of 11.0% to 16.5% (January 2, 2016: 11.0% to 19.0%). 
   99 




Table of Contents

 As a result of the impairment testing, no impairment was recognized during Fiscal 2016. An
impairment of $44.0 million was recognized during Fiscal 2015.  We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be
reasonable at the time but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years. 
Other Long-Lived Assets  A long-lived
asset or finite lived intangible asset or asset group is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount. In that event, an impairment loss is recognized to
the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Fair value is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk
involved. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived and intangible assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, with the limitation that the carrying amount of an individual
asset is not reduced below its fair value.   As of December 31, 2016, the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment was
$599.6 million, excluding assets held for sale, compared with $660.6 million as of January 2, 2016. Impairments of plant and equipment in the normal course of operations were $0 million during Fiscal 2016. An impairment of plant and
equipment in Gates South America for $6.7 million was recognized during Fiscal 2015.   The carrying amount of finite-lived
intangible assets at December 31, 2016 was $1,674.7 million compared with $1,864.9 million as of January 2, 2016. During Fiscal 2016, an impairment of $2.0 million was recognized in relation to computer software but there
were no significant impairments of finite-lived intangible assets recognized during either Fiscal 2015 or Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014. During Pre-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, we recorded
impairments in relation to Aquatics customer relationship intangible assets of $34.3 million.  Impairment losses may be
recognized on assets within the next financial year if there are adverse changes in the variables and assumptions underlying the estimated future cash flows of the reporting units or asset group, or the discount rates that are applied to those cash
flows.  Inventory 
Inventories on a last in, first out (LIFO) and first in, first out (FIFO) basis are stated at the lower of cost or net
realizable value. A valuation adjustment is made to inventory for any excess, obsolete or slow moving items based on managements review of on-hand inventories compared with historical and estimated
future sales and usage profiles.  Cost is generally determined on a FIFO basis, but the cost of certain U.S. inventories is determined on
a LIFO basis. As of December 31, 2016, inventories whose cost was determined on a LIFO basis represented 35.5% of the total carrying amount of inventories, compared with 38.1% as of January 2, 2016. 
As of December 31, 2016, the carrying value of inventories was $366.9 million compared with $415.7 million as of
January 2, 2016. Should demand for our products decline during the next financial year, additional allowances may be necessary in respect of excess or slow-moving items. 
Financial Instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are recognized as an asset or a liability measured at their fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair
value of derivatives continually changes in response to changes in prevailing market conditions and applicable credit risk spreads. 
   100 




Table of Contents

 Where permissible under GAAP, we use hedge accounting to mitigate the impact of changes in the
fair value of derivatives on income or loss but our results may be affected by changes in the fair values of derivatives where hedge accounting cannot be applied or due to hedge ineffectiveness. 
Share-Based Compensation 
Share-based compensation has historically been provided to certain of our employees under share option, bonus and other share award plans. The
awards granted during Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 were made under plans operated by Omaha Topco, and represent rights over its ordinary shares. A description of the plans in operation during the periods and the
costs recognized by us in respect of those plans is presented in note 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. We expect that the Omaha Topco plans will be assumed by Gates Industrial Corporation plc
in connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions.  We recognize a compensation expense
in respect of these plans that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured at the date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula or a Monte-Carlo valuation model and reflecting market performance conditions and all non-vesting conditions. Fair value is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified. 
Generally, the compensation expense for each separately vesting portion of the award is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting
period for that portion of the award subject to continued service with us through each vesting date. A compensation expense is recognized for awards containing performance conditions only to the extent that it is probable that those performance
conditions will be met. Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions. 
We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and, to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in
future periods will likely increase.  The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,
including the fair value of the underlying shares, the expected volatility of the price of our shares, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our shares. These estimates involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of managements judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. 
 


 

 
Fair Value of Our Shares. As the Companys shares are not publicly traded, we must estimate the fair value of our shares, as discussed in Share Valuations below. 
 


 

 
Expected Volatility. As we have not been a public company and do not have a trading history for our shares, the expected stock price volatility for our shares is estimated by taking the average historical
price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the share option grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until
a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies
whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation.   


 

 
Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. 
 


 

 
Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our share-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of
the share option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option.

Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to shareholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected
dividend yield of zero.  The fair values of the options issued by the Company at their grant date was measured using a
Black-Scholes valuation model, with a large number of sample simulations run for Tiers II, III and IV. The fair values and relevant assumptions were as follows:

 Share Valuations 
The fair value of our shares has historically been determined based upon information available at the time of grant. Given the absence of a
public trading market for our shares and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid,
management has exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our shares at each grant date. These factors included: 
 


 

 
our operating and financial performance;   


 

 
current business conditions and projections;   


 

 
the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of shares underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; 
 


 

 
the lack of marketability of our shares; and   


 

 
the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies.  In valuing our shares, we
determined the equity value of our business using a weighted blend of the income and market approaches. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present value of such companys future estimated cash flows and the
residual value of such company beyond the forecast period. These future values are discounted to their present values to reflect the risks inherent in such company achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant inputs of the income approach (in
addition to our estimated future cash flows themselves) include the long-term growth rate assumed in the residual value, discount rate and normalized long-term operating margin. The terminal value was calculated to estimate our value beyond the
forecast period by applying valuation metrics to the final year of our forecasted revenue and discounting that value to the present value using the same weighted average cost of capital applied to the forecasted periods. 
   102 




Table of Contents

 Following the closing of our initial public offering, the fair value per share of our shares for
purposes of determining stock-based compensation will be the closing price of our shares as reported on the applicable grant date. 
Product Warranties 
Provision is made for the estimated cost of future warranty claims on our products. Management bases the provision on historical experience of
the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and takes into account recent trends that might suggest that the historical claims experience may differ from future claims. Further provision may be necessary within the next financial year
if actual claims experience differs from managements estimates.  Taxation 
We are subject to income tax in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Management is required to exercise significant judgment in
determining our provision for income taxes. Managements judgment is required in relation to uncertain tax positions whereby additional current tax may become payable in the future following the audit by tax authorities of previously-filed tax
returns. It is possible that the final outcome of these uncertain tax positions may differ from managements estimates.  Management
assesses uncertain tax positions based upon an evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for uncertain tax positions to the extent that the amounts previously taken or expected to
be taken in tax returns exceeds the tax benefits that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the tax positions. A tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if management considers that it
is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant tax authority solely on the technical merits of the position and is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that will more likely than not be
realized upon settlement assuming that the tax authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect events such as the expiration of limitation periods
for assessing tax, guidance given by the tax authorities and court decisions.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on
the expected future tax consequences of the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax basis. Deferred taxes are measured on the enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income at the time the difference is
anticipated to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized taking into account the timing and amount of the reversal of
taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.  Deferred tax is provided on certain taxable
temporary differences arising on investments in foreign subsidiaries, except where we intend, and are able, to reinvest such amounts on a permanent basis or to remit such amounts in a tax-free manner. 
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
Recently-issued accounting pronouncements that may be relevant to our operations but have not yet been adopted are outlined in note 2 to our
audited consolidated financial statements and note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, each included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
Our market risk includes the potential loss arising from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity
prices. From time to time, we use derivative financial instruments, principally 
   103 




Table of Contents

 
foreign currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate caps (options), to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. We do not hold or issue
derivatives for speculative purposes and monitor closely the credit quality of the institutions with which we transact. Our objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates and interest rate movements.  On a regular basis, we monitor third-party depository institutions that hold our
cash and short-term investments, primarily for safety of principal and secondarily for maximizing yield on those funds. We diversify our cash and short-term investments among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. We also
monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and suppliers to mitigate any adverse impact.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
We have global operations and thus make investments and enter into transactions denominated in various foreign currencies. Our operating
results are impacted by buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating companies. We monitor exposure to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of each country in
which we operate, and enter into forward contracts to mitigate that exposure as needed. We also naturally hedge foreign currency through our production in the countries in which we sell our products. 
In addition, we are exposed to currency risk associated with translating our functional currency financial statements into its reporting
currency, which is the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. Translational foreign exchange risks arise predominantly on the potential increase in our significant
euro debt when translated to U.S. dollars, as well as on the potential decreases in the value of our earnings, cash balances and other net assets denominated in euro and other currencies when translated to U.S. dollars. 
The currency profiles of our cash and debt are centrally managed as are decisions about the location of cash. The currency profile of cash and
debt, after taking into account the effect of forward currency swaps used to manage those profiles, were as follows:

 As described in note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
prospectus, we have designated 192.8 million of our Euro Term Loans, 235.0 million of our euro notes and a 254.5 million cross currency swap as hedges of the majority of our net investment in euro-denominated foreign
operations. Changes in the value of these instruments resulting from fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar

exchange rate are accordingly recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income. 
Interest Rate Risk  Our prevailing market
risk on interest rates is the potential fluctuation in interest costs and in the fair value of long-term debt resulting from movements in interest rates. 
We use interest rate caps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy to add stability to interest expense and to manage our
exposure to interest rate movements. The interest rate caps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate payments from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for a
premium. The following table summarizes the key terms of the interest rate derivatives held by the Company:

 Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Our debt
facilities are monitored against forecast requirements and timely action is taken to put in place, renew or replace credit lines. We aim to reduce liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources, maintaining adequate headroom under our debt
facilities and by staggering the maturities of our debt.

 We have established long-term credit ratings of Ba3 Stable with Moodys and BB- Stable with Standard & Poors. Credit ratings are subject to regular review by the credit rating agencies and may change in response to economic and commercial developments. 
For the expected timing of contractual cash flows relating to the financial liabilities and related financial assets see the table set out
above under Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations.  Commodity Risk 
We source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers. While such materials are typically available from
numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials such as aluminum, steel and polymers are subject to price fluctuations, which could have a negative impact on our results. We primarily manage these risks through normal operating activities. We strive to
pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lean initiatives to further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as we achieve improved efficiencies. We historically have
not entered into any derivative commodity instruments to manage the exposure to changing price risk for supplies, but we will continue to evaluate their viability. 
Controls and Procedures  Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are currently in the process of reviewing,
documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting.  We have not performed an evaluation of our internal control over
financial reporting, such as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, nor have we engaged an independent registered public accounting firm to perform an audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of any balance sheet
date or for any period reported in our financial statements. Presently, we are not an accelerated filer, as such term is defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
Exchange Act), and therefore, our management is not presently required to perform an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This requirement will first apply to our second Annual Report
on Form 10-K after the completion of this offering.

 BUSINESS 
Gates Overview  We are a global
manufacturer of innovative, highly engineered power transmission and fluid power solutions. We offer a broad portfolio of products to diverse replacement channel customers, and to original equipment manufacturers as specified components, with the
majority of our revenue coming from replacement channels. Our products are used in applications across numerous end markets, which include construction, agriculture, energy, automotive, transportation, general industrial, consumer products and many
others. Our revenue has historically been highly correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators of our
performance include industrial production, industrial sales and manufacturer shipments. We sell our products globally under the Gates brand, which is recognized by distributors, equipment manufacturers, installers and end users as a premium brand
for quality and technological innovation; this reputation has been built for over a century since Gates founding in 1911. Within the diverse end markets we serve, our highly engineered products are critical components in applications for which
the cost of downtime is high relative to the cost of our products, resulting in the willingness of end users to pay a premium for superior performance and availability. These applications subject our products to normal wear and tear, resulting in a
natural replacement cycle that drives high-margin, recurring revenue. Our product portfolio represents one of the broadest ranges of power transmission and fluid power products in the markets we serve, and we maintain long-standing relationships
with a diversified group of blue-chip customers throughout the world. As a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered, mission-critical products, we have become an industry leader across most of the regions and end markets in
which we operate.   During Fiscal 2016, we generated $2,747.0 million in net sales to over 8,000 customers in 128 countries, our net
income was $84.3 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $594.9 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.7%, an increase of 180 basis points from Fiscal 2015. During Fiscal 2015, we generated $2,745.1 million in net sales, our net
income was $50.9 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $547.2 million, representing an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.9%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our net sales increased 8.7% to $2,259.9 million compared to $2,079.3 million
for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, our net income was $52.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $69.0 million in the prior year period, and our Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.0% to $496.1 million,
compared to $447.0 million in the prior year period, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.0%, a 50 basis point increase compared to the prior year period. As of September 30, 2017, our total indebtedness was approximately $3,916.1 million,
or $3,236.3 million on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds therefrom. For reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see SummarySummary
Historical Consolidated Financial Information.   Gates business is well-balanced and diversified across products, channels
and geographies, which is highlighted in the following charts showing breakdowns of our Fiscal 2016 net sales of $2,747 million.

 Our History and Recent Developments 
On October 1, 1911, Charles Gates, Sr. purchased the Colorado Tire and Leather Company, a manufacturer of steel-studded bands of leather
that attached to tires to extend their mileage. In 1917, the Company changed its name to the International Rubber Company and commercialized the V-belt, which used rubber and woven threading instead of rope belts, which were more commonly used at
that time. The Company was renamed Gates Rubber Company in 1919 and entered a period of domestic expansion to become the largest manufacturer of V-belts. In 1963, the Gates Rubber Company built its first of
many international facilities in Erembodegem, Belgium, followed by Jacarei, Brazil, in 1973. In 1986 Gates acquired the Uniroyal Power Transmission Company (Uniroyal) and became the worlds largest synchronous/timing belt
manufacturer. This acquisition included Uniroyals share of the Unitta joint venture that it established in 1970 with Japan-based Nitta Corporation, laying the groundwork for Gates growth in the Asia-Pacific region. We have full
operational control over the joint venture, and as such consolidate it in our financial statements. Nitta Corporation retains a 49% minority stake in the equity of the venture. The joint venture is limited in scope to our power transmission business
in Asia.   In 1996, the Gates Rubber Company was acquired by a publicly held engineering firm based in the United Kingdom, Tomkins plc
(Tomkins), ending 85 years of family ownership. In 2010, Tomkins was acquired by Onex Partners and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, who proceeded to divest the individual Tomkins companies under a new parent entity, Pinafore
Holdings B.V. Gates was acquired by funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. in July 2014.   In 2015, Gates established a new
executive leadership team with the appointment of Ivo Jurek as Chief Executive Officer and David Naemura as Chief Financial Officer. Under the new leadership team, investments have been made to shift the organization from a regional model to a
global product-line model by building out a global product-line management function and globalizing our engineering teams into product-line focused groups. This shift has allowed us to develop global, market-facing product strategies and product
roadmaps to better align and focus our resources on executing our growth initiatives. We have continued to invest in, upgrade and expand our regionally-based commercial teams. During this time we also implemented a global functional structure across
our human resources, information technology, finance, legal, R&D and operations teams. These global functional teams are driving consistency of best-practice processes across each function, improving our performance and efficiency. These
initiatives fall under the Gates Operating System (GOS), a philosophy of continuous improvement and standardized best practices which we have deployed across our organization. The implementation of this system has resulted in increased productivity,
reduced costs and contributed to margin improvements since 2014. We have also continued to invest in, upgrade and expand our regionally-based commercial teams and information technology infrastructure. We have developed an active acquisition
pipeline and the organizational capability to integrate acquired companies. In 2017, we closed two transactions, Techflow Flexibles in the United Kingdom and Atlas Hydraulics in North America, both focused on expanding our presence in industrial
markets with new products, capabilities, capacity and geographic reach. We believe that our global functional excellence, product-line focus and strong commercial teams provide a solid foundation to deliver on our continuous improvement and organic
growth initiatives, supplemented by our ability to execute on inorganic opportunities.   Our Solutions 
We operate our business on a product-line basis through our two reporting segments  Power Transmission and Fluid Power.
 We sell our highly engineered products under the Gates brand in all geographies and end markets. Our power transmission segment includes
elastomer drive belts and related components used to efficiently transfer motion in a broad range of applications. Power transmission products represented approximately 68% of our total 
   108 




Table of Contents

 
net sales for Fiscal 2016. Our fluid power segment includes hoses, tubing and fittings designed to convey hydraulic fluid at high pressures in both mobile and stationary applications, and other
high-pressure and fluid transfer hoses used to convey various fluids. Our fluid power products represented approximately 32% of our net sales for Fiscal 2016. 
Our power transmission and fluid power products are often critical to the functioning of the equipment, process or system in which they are
components, creating a dynamic where the cost of downtime or potential equipment damage is high relative to the cost of our products. For example, on an agricultural harvester, we estimate that the cost of system downtime during harvest season is
approximately $5,300 per hour, whereas the cost of a replacement hydraulic hose assembly is approximately $300. Industrial synchronous drives, which can cost an end user as little as $75, are widely used to power key systems in industrial
facilities. Failure of these drives can stop production and result in significant downtime costs. Because the cost of our products is low relative to the cost of downtime or equipment damage, our products are not only replaced as a result of normal
wear and tear, but also preemptively as part of ongoing maintenance to the broader system.  We believe that we provide industry-leading
delivery times for our products and have a broad portfolio of both power transmission and fluid power products in the end markets we serve. We have a long history of focusing on customer engagement and training, driving product innovation and
providing best-in-class order fulfilment services. This allows us to maintain a consistently high level of customer satisfaction, driving continued loyalty among our customer base. 
Power Transmission. We are the leading manufacturer of power transmission belts globally. Our Power Transmission solutions
enable and control motion. They are used in applications in which belts, chains, cables, geared transmissions or direct drives transfer power from an engine or motor to another part or system. Belt-based power transmission drives typically consist
of either a synchronous belt or an asynchronous belt (V-belt, CVT belt or Micro-V® belt) and related components (sprockets, pulleys, water pumps, tensioners or other accessories). Within our
Power Transmission segment, we offer solutions across the following key application platforms:     




   


 

 
Stationary drives: fixed drive systems such as those used in a factory driving a machine or pump, or on a grain elevator driving the lift auger. 
 


 

 
Mobile drives: drives on a piece of mobile machinery such as a combine harvester or a road compactor, or in applications such as the brush head of a vacuum cleaner. 
 


 

 
Engine systems: synchronous drives and related components for cam shafts and auxiliary drives and asynchronous accessory drives for A/C compressors, power steering, alternators and starter/generator systems.
  


 

 
Personal mobility: drives on motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles that are used to transfer power between the power source and the drive wheel(s) or track.

efficiency and reliability, as well as the support they receive from their suppliers, including application-specific engineering. Belt-based drive systems have many advantages over other
alternatives, as they are typically clean, low-maintenance, lubrication-free, quiet with low-vibration, light-weight, compact, energy-efficient, durable and reliable. In applications where these advantages are valued, customers typically choose
belts over other forms of power transmission solutions.  Our belts are classified by their general design into asynchronous and
synchronous belts; in addition, we also manufacture metal drive products and assemble automotive replacement kits.  Asynchronous
Belts. Asynchronous belts are our highest-volume products and are used in a broad range of applications. Asynchronous belts are made of proprietary rubber formulations, textiles and embedded cords for reinforcement. We were a pioneer in the
design and manufacturing of V-belts, which draw their name from the shape of their profile, and today we believe we are one of their largest manufacturers in the world. We also manufacture ribbed V-belts, which are belts with lengthwise
V-shaped grooves, which we market under the Micro-V® name. This design results in a thinner belt for the same drive surface, making it more flexible and offering improved efficiency through
lower friction losses. Belt starter/generator (BSG) belts are used in start/stop accessory drive systems on automobiles and other engine applications used to improve fuel economy. The demanding BSG system functionality, including
engine starting, torque boosting and energy recuperation, requires a high-performance belt construction. Continuously-variable transmission (CVT) systems found in scooters, power sports vehicles and other applications use a specialized
V-belt knows as a CVT belt.  In industrial end markets, asynchronous belts have a wide variety of applications, including use in pump
drives, manufacturing lines, HVAC systems, industrial engines, truck, bus and marine engines, forestry and mining equipment and many other applications. In automotive applications, our asynchronous belts perform functions that include transferring
power from the crankshaft to accessory drive components such as the alternator, A/C compressor, power steering system, water pump and, in some vehicles, a BSG system.  
  



  Synchronous Belts. Synchronous belts, also known as timing belts, are non-slipping mechanical drive
belts. They have teeth molded onto the inner surface and they run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. Synchronous belts experience no slippage and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes, as well as for linear
positioning and positive drive conveying. They are typically used instead of chains or gears and we believe have a number of advantages over these alternatives, including less noise, no need for lubrication, improved durability and performance and a
more compact design. Our synchronous belts are made of a flexible polymer over fabric reinforcement and are often built with Kevlar, aramid and carbon fibers.

 Examples of industrial applications include use in HVAC systems, food processing and bottling
plants, mining and agricultural equipment, automatic doors and robotics. In automotive applications, our synchronous belts are used to synchronize the rotation of the engine crankshaft with the camshaft due to engine combustion in a valve train
system, as well as in electric power steering and parking brake systems which are present in gasoline-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles.   
  



  Metal Drive Components. We manufacture and sell the tensioners and idlers used in belt drive
systems. These products are designed and engineered to work efficiently with our belts. Tensioners are devices that maintain a constant tension in the belt drive system, thereby ensuring proper function and preventing loss of power or system
failure. Tensioners typically employ a spring that places pressure along the belt for an intricate hold, while still allowing enough movement for vibration and to prevent stretching. Idlers, which sometimes also perform as tensioners, are used to
take up extra belt length.      



  Kits. Our kits for the automotive replacement market include all of the parts needed by an
automotive service shop to perform a replacement of one of our products. Kits are created for specific makes and models and typically include belts, tensioners and idlers, and will sometimes also include water pumps as they are often replaced when a
timing belt is replaced. Our kits are convenient for service technicians as they eliminate the need for more complicated product sourcing. On a comparable quantity basis, kits typically sell at a premium to a loose belt and single tensioner. 
    



  Our power transmission products are used in a broad range of applications in end markets including
construction, agriculture, transportation, automotive, energy, general industrial and consumer products. The majority of our Fiscal 2016 net sales came from the replacement markets, which provide high-margin, recurring revenue streams and are driven
by attractive market trends. The bulk of our power transmission replacement business resides in developed regions, in which a large, aging installed base of equipment follows a natural maintenance cycle and is served by well-developed
distribution channels. For example, a combine harvester in North America has over 25 high-performance belts that are typically replaced at regular intervals, depending on wear and tear, with end users having access to replacement parts through an
established channel. Similarly, in the 
   111 




Table of Contents

 
North American automotive replacement market, maintenance intervals are well defined and miles driven per vehicle are increasing, leading to more wear and tear on vehicles. A smaller portion
of our power transmission replacement business is generated in emerging markets, which generally have a smaller base of installed equipment and relatively immature distribution channels. As they continue to develop, these replacement markets
represent a significant long-term opportunity for growth. An example of this is the light-vehicle population in China, which has a sweet spot (vehicles aged five to 12 years that typically require more frequent maintenance) that is
expected to grow at an 16% CAGR from 2016 through 2020.    



  In addition to our significant power transmission replacement business, we also serve a wide variety of
blue-chip first-fit customers across all of our end markets. The majority of our automotive first-fit Fiscal 2016 revenues in power transmission came from emerging markets. These markets generally are higher-growth and result in higher-margin
business than our developed regions. Our first-fit presence in these markets serves to further strengthen our brand, strongly positioning us to serve the growing base of installed equipment as the nascent replacement channels continue to develop.
Less than 10% of our total Fiscal 2016 revenue came from automotive first-fit applications in developed regions. Our selective participation in these mature markets allows us to stay on the leading edge of product and technology development,
enhances our replacement market position and reinforces the strength of our premium brand globally.  Fluid Power. Our Fluid
Power solutions are used in applications in which hoses and rigid tubing assemblies either transfer power hydraulically or convey fluids, gases or granular materials from one location to another. Within our Fluid Power segment, we offer solutions
across the following key application platforms:    



   


 

 
Stationary hydraulics: applications within stationary machinery, such as an injection molding machine or a manufacturing press. 
 


 

 
Mobile hydraulics: applications used to power various implements in mobile equipment used in construction, agriculture, mining and other heavy industries. 
 


 

 
Engine systems: applications for engine systems such as coolant, fuel, A/C, turbocharger, air intake and SCR for diesel emissions. 
   112

Other industrial: applications in which hoses are used to convey fluids, gases or granular material across several industries such as oil and gas drilling and refining, food and beverage and other process
industries.  Customers choose fluid power solutions based on a number of factors including application-specific product
performance parameters such as pressure and temperature ratings, corrosion and leak resistance, weight, flexibility, abrasion resistance and cleanliness, as well as compliance with standards and product availability. Attributes associated with the
supplier, including brand, global footprint and reputation for reliability and quality, are also considered.  Hydraulics. Our
hydraulics product line is comprised of hoses, tubing and fittings, as well as assemblies consisting of these products. Our hydraulic products are key components of hydraulic systems in both stationary and mobile equipment applications. We provide a
full selection of hose sizes and construction types for use in a wide variety of working requirements and conditions. Hydraulic hoses are made of synthetic rubber and reinforced with steel wire or a textile-based yarn, and typically operate at very
high pressures, often in extreme environmental conditions. Hoses are designed for use in specific mechanical applications and require high levels of quality and durability. 
Our hydraulic fittings and tubing are engineered to match the product performance of our hydraulic hoses. The high-pressure nature of
hydraulic systems requires these products have high levels of performance similar to those found in our hydraulic hoses. The ultimate performance of a hydraulic assembly, in which our products function as part of a hydraulic circuit, depends not
only on how well the components are made, but also on how well they complement each other. In order to ensure compatibility with numerous applications, our hydraulic fittings are manufactured in a wide assortment of sizes, crimping systems and
materials, and are protected by a range of patents. Our hydraulic products and assemblies are used in construction, agricultural and forestry equipment, as well as in food and other processing lines and stationary machinery. 
    



  Engine Hose. Our engine hose products perform a variety of conveyance functions in engine
applications in gasoline-powered, hybrid and electric vehicles. Engine system applications for which Gates provides solutions include coolant (radiator, heater), air system (turbocharger, intake, vacuum, crankcase ventilation), fuel, oil
(transmission oil cooling, power steering) and emissions/Diesel Exhaust Filtration (DEF) systems.    



  Industrial Hose. Our industrial hoses are capable of transferring a wide range of
substanceschemicals, food and beverages, petroleum, fuels, bulk materials, water, steam and airto meet the requirements of diverse applications, including manufacturing, mining, oil and gas drilling, marine, agriculture, industrial
cleaning and construction. Our application engineering teams work with customers to assist them in selecting the appropriate hose solution to safely meet their operational needs. We leverage our materials science expertise to enable hose
performance at varying pressures and levels of resistance to chemicals, oil, abrasion, ozone, flame and both hot and cold temperatures. For performance in extreme environments, many of our industrial hoses feature both crush-resistant and
flexible designs. Gates industrial hoses are highly engineered to meet or exceed a multitude of 
   113 




Table of Contents

 
industry standards and certifications, and are offered in a range of diameters, lengths and colors to allow customers to differentiate the hoses in applications. We also offer a wide range
of couplings to provide complete assembly solutions to our customers.   



  Our fluid power products are used in numerous applications, including construction, agriculture,
transportation, automotive, energy and general industrial. The largest portion of our Fiscal 2016 fluid power revenue came from replacement markets. Within these replacement markets, the majority of our revenue comes from industrial applications. As
an example, over 85% of our portfolio of industrial hose products is sold into industrial applications through our replacement channel. Approximately 25% of our Fiscal 2016 fluid power revenue came from products sold into the automotive end
market, almost all of which was served through the higher-margin replacement channel. While our overall oil and gas exposure is small, with less than 10% of our total Fiscal 2016 revenue generated by sales into oil & gas applications, we
believe that continued investment in expanding our product portfolio through organic and inorganic initiatives, such as the acquisition of Techflow Flexibles, better positions us to take share in these markets irrespective of market cyclicality.
Our Diverse Markets  We participate in
many sectors of the industrial and consumer markets. Our products play essential roles in a diverse range of applications across a wide variety of end markets ranging from harsh and hazardous industries such as agriculture, construction,
manufacturing and energy, to everyday consumer applications such as printers, power washers, automatic doors and vacuum cleaners. Virtually every form of transportation, ranging from trucks, buses and automobiles to personal mobility vehicles such
as motorcycles, scooters, bicycles, snowmobiles and other power sports vehicles, uses our products. We believe the large, diverse and global nature of the markets we serve provides attractive opportunities for profitable growth. Based on market
research data, as well as our own analysis, we believe that we have a total core addressable market opportunity of approximately $59 billion. Power Transmission accounts for approximately $30 billion of the total core addressable market
opportunity, divided approximately among the following product categories: $1.8 billion in synchronous drives, $3.1 billion in asynchronous drives, $7.5 billion in metals and $17.5 billion in other drive systems. Fluid Power
represents approximately $29 billion of the total core addressable market opportunity, divided approximately among the following product categories: $11.2 billion in hydraulics, $14.0 billion in engine hose and $3.5 billion in
industrial hose.  We believe the end markets we serve benefit from inherent growth provided by several attractive, secular, long-term
trends that create demand for the applications in which our products are used. Underlying all of the long-term trends is the growth of the worlds population, which is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050. Along with population growth comes an
increased demand for water and food, the production of which is expected to increase 59% by 2050. This increased level of food production is expected to drive a corresponding increase in demand for both farming and food processing equipment. Related
water demand will drive increased needs for water treatment facilities and pumping stations, all of which rely upon our products.  This
population growth and a growing middle-class in emerging markets also drive an increased infrastructure build-out, which requires more construction equipment to build roads, bridges, rail systems and buildings. The worlds population also
continues to urbanize, with 70% of people expected to live in cities by 2050, up from 50% today. Urbanization leads to more vertical infrastructure, and, with more people living in high rise buildings, there will be an increased need for elevators
and other vertical lift systems. These trends also positively impact the transportation markets our products are used in, ranging from trucks, buses and automobiles 
   114 




Table of Contents

 
to personal mobility vehicles such as motorcycles, scooters and bicycles. Additionally, we expect these trends to continue to generate increased demand for energy production over the long term.
Oil and gas drilling and refining, alternative energy generation and mining equipment all leverage Gates products.  Industries across the
globe are also continuously investing in automation and productivity improvements. Energy efficiency, advanced technology and emerging economies are expected to continue to drive growth in the industrial automation market. As an example, new
installations of industrial robots are forecast to grow at a 13% CAGR from 2017 to 2019, while the demand for 3D printing technology is also expected to increase. Belt drives generally outperform other forms of mechanical power transmission, giving
even more reason to choose a belt drive versus alternatives in all of these applications.  Our revenue has historically been highly
correlated with industrial activity and utilization, and not with any single end market given the diversification of our business and high exposure to replacement markets. Key indicators include industrial production, industrial sales and
manufacturer shipments. We believe we are well positioned to outpace these indicators by leveraging our competitive strengths to penetrate underserved core markets. 
Our products are sold in 128 countries across our four commercial regions: (1) the Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East &
Africa; (3) Greater China; and (4) East Asia & India. We have a long-standing presence in each of these regions, and our commercial teams have demonstrated a track record of growing in emerging markets. For example, Gates realized
year-over-year Fiscal 2016 net sales growth of 14.9% in Brazil, 20.5% in Russia, 12.2% in Turkey, 17.0% in India and 1.8% in China compared to Fiscal 2015. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year Fiscal 2016 net sales
growth rates were 21.3% in Brazil, 27.9% in Russia, 16.4% in Turkey, 22.5% in India and 8.7% in China compared to Fiscal 2015.  Our
commercial capabilities are complemented by our global manufacturing footprint, which frequently allows us to manufacture products in close proximity to our customers. We have power transmission and fluid power operations in each commercial region
and typically manufacture products for both first-fit customers and replacement customers in the same factory, which provides improved factory loading and demand leveling, as well as optimization of capital expenditures. Our in-region,
for-region footprint and extensive distribution network provide us with a close-to-customer local mindset that enables rapid response for our customer base. We believe this combination of capabilities enhances our value proposition
and strengthens our customer relationships.  Customers 
We maintain long-standing relationships with many customers who value our leading global brand, extensive distribution network, scale and
comprehensive portfolio of quality products. Our customers range from local distributors with one location to large, global manufacturers of equipment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our Fiscal 2016 net sales and, of our total net
sales attributable to our top ten customers, 74% was in replacement channels.  Sales and Marketing and Distribution Organization 
Our sales and distribution operations are structured to serve our customers efficiently across the globe. We have field representatives who
possess local knowledge of product and application requirements, allowing us to meet our customers product availability requirements with short lead times. Our global sales and service support team helps reinforce customer and distributor

 Legal Proceedings 
Gates is, from time to time, party to general legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Gates is also, from
time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims in respect of environmental obligations, product liability, intellectual property and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business and against which management believes meritorious
defenses are available.  While it is not possible to quantify the financial impact or predict the outcome of all pending claims and
litigation, management does not anticipate that the outcome of any current proceedings or known claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Composition of the Board of Directors After this Offering 
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. Following completion of this offering, we expect our board
of directors to initially consist of seven directors, of whom Mr. Plant, 
   124 




Table of Contents

 
Mr. Klebe and Mrs. Ovelmen will have affirmatively been determined by our board of directors to be independent. We are party to a shareholders agreement with certain affiliates of our
Sponsor. This agreement grants our Sponsor the right to designate nominees to our board of directors subject to the maintenance of certain ownership requirements in us. See Certain Relationships and Related Person
TransactionsShareholders Agreement.  Background and Experience of Directors 
When considering whether directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills, taken as a whole, to enable our
board of directors to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the board of directors focuses primarily on each persons background and experience as reflected in the information discussed in
each of the directors individual biographies set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. In particular, the members of our board of
directors considered the following important characteristics, among others:   


 

 
Mr. Jureks extensive business and industry experience as well as his experience leading Gates since May 2015.   


 

 
Mr. Calhouns management perspective he brings to Board deliberations and his extensive management expertise at public companies, including as former Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman and director of
Nielsen.   


 

 
Mr. Simpkins significant financial and business experience, including as a Senior Managing Director in the Corporate Private Equity Group at Blackstone and former Principal at Bain Capital. 
 


 

 
Ms. Kahrs extensive knowledge of a variety of different industries and her significant financial and investment experience from her involvement in Blackstone, including as Senior Managing Director.

Mr. Plants significant management and operational experience from his service in various senior management roles, including as former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of TRW
Automotive.

Controlled Company Exception  After the
completion of this offering, our Sponsor will continue to hold more than a majority of the voting power of our ordinary shares eligible to vote in the election of our directors. As a result, we will be a controlled company within the
meaning of the NYSE corporate governance standards. Under these NYSE corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a controlled company and may
elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements (1) that a majority of our board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) that our board of directors have a compensation committee that
is comprised entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities and (3) that our board of directors have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is comprised
entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committees purpose and responsibilities. For at least some period following this offering, we intend to utilize these exemptions. As a result, immediately following this
offering we do not expect the majority of our directors will be independent or that our compensation committee or nominating and corporate governance committee will be comprised entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you will not have the
same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are 
   125 




Table of Contents

 
subject to all of these corporate governance requirements. In the event that we cease to be a controlled company and our ordinary shares continue to be listed on the NYSE, we will be
required to comply with these provisions within the applicable transition periods.  Board Committees 
Upon completion of this offering, the standing committees of our board of directors will consist of an audit committee, a compensation
committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. The composition and responsibilities of each committee are described below. Our board of directors may also establish from time to time any other committees that it deems necessary or
desirable. Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors.  Audit
Committee  Our audit committee will consist of Ms. Kahr, Mr. Klebe and Mrs. Ovelmen, with Mr. Klebe serving as

employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters; and   


 

 
preparing the audit committee report that the rules and regulations of the SEC require to be included in our annual proxy statement. 
The SEC rules and NYSE rules require us to have one independent audit committee member upon the listing of our ordinary shares
on the NYSE, a majority of independent directors within 90 days of the effective date of the registration statement and all independent audit committee members within one year of the effective date of the registration statement. Mr.
Klebe and Mrs. Ovelmen qualify as independent directors under the NYSE listing standards and the independence standards of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. In addition, our board of directors has determined that each of Mr. Klebe and
Mrs. Ovelmen is an audit committee financial expert within the meaning of Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

compensation, including during the last completed fiscal year. Other than Mr. Jurek, no member of the board was at any time during the last completed fiscal year, or at any other time, one of our officers or employees. None of our executive
officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other committee performing equivalent functions) of any entity that has one or more of its executive
officers serving on the board. We are party to certain transactions with affiliates of our Sponsor described in Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions. 
Code of Ethics  We will adopt a new Code
of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar
functions, which will be posted on our website. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is a code of ethics, as defined in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K. We will make any legally required disclosures regarding amendments to, or
waivers of, provisions of our code of ethics on our website. The information contained on, or accessible from, our website is not part of this prospectus by reference or otherwise.

 EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The share and option information with respect to Omaha Topco in this Executive and Director Compensation section has not been
adjusted to give effect to the pre-IPO reorganization transactions.   Director Compensation 
Our employee director and Sponsor-affiliated directors receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board. As such, none of our
directors, other than Terry Klebe, John Plant and Karyn Ovelmen, received compensation for the year ended December 31, 2017. All of our directors are reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses related to their service as a member of
the Board.  Karyn Ovelmen was appointed to our Board effective December 15, 2017. She received a cash retainer of $5,200 for her
service as a director in Fiscal 2017.  Messrs. Klebe and Plant each received an annual cash retainer of $150,000 (payable in quarterly
installments in arrears). The following stock options have been granted to Mr. Klebe under the 2014 Incentive Plan and Mr. Plant under the 2015 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan: 
 


 

 
In connection with joining the Board in fiscal 2016, Mr. Klebe was granted a one-time award of 100,000 time-based vesting stock options on May 12, 2016. These stock options are subject to the vesting
restrictions described below. On that same date, Mr. Klebe purchased 75,000 shares of Omaha Topco at a price of $5.00 per share.   


 

 
In connection with joining the Board in fiscal 2015, Mr. Plant was granted a one-time award of 100,000 time-based vesting stock options on May 14, 2015. These stock options are subject to the vesting
restrictions described below. On that same date, Mr. Plant purchased 60,000 shares of Omaha Topco at a price of $5.00 per share. 
These stock options vest 20% on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the
2015 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan), the stock options, to the extent not already vested, will become fully vested and exercisable. If service terminates for any reason, then the stock options, to the extent not then vested and exercisable,
will immediately be canceled. The stock options have a ten-year term, and will generally remain outstanding and exercisable for 90 days following the termination of service as a director (or, if earlier,
the expiration date of the stock option). This period is extended to 12 months if service is terminated due to death or disability. 
In 2017, we analyzed competitive market data provided by the Consultant (as defined below) relating to director compensation programs,
including both cash retainers, equity awards and stock ownership guidelines. These compensation elements were benchmarked against the same 15-company peer group that was used to evaluate executive compensation
pay levels and program design and is described in detail below in the section entitled Role of Independent Compensation Consultant, as well as a general industry group consisting of comparably sized general industry (excluding financial
services) companies with median revenues of approximately Gates size. As a result of the analysis, in connection with this offering we have developed a market-competitive director compensation program for our
non-employee, non-Sponsor affiliated directors. The program will provide eligible directors with an annual compensation package of $225,000 consisting of $125,000 as an
annual cash retainer (payable in quarterly installments in arrears) and $100,000 in value of restricted stock units (payable annually). Eligible directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their cash retainer in the form of restricted stock
units. Restricted stock units elected in lieu of payments in cash will have the same vesting terms as the annual restricted stock unit grant. 
   128

 As part of this program, the Lead Director and chairpersons of the following committees will
receive the additional fixed annual cash retainers (payable in quarterly installments in arrears) listed below. We reimburse all Directors for expenses associated with each meeting attended.

  In connection with this offering we also expect to adopt stock ownership guidelines for our non-employee, non-Sponsor affiliated directors in order to better align our eligible directors financial interests with those of our shareholders by requiring such
directors to own a minimum level of our shares. Each of our non-employee, non-Sponsor affiliated directors will be required to own stock in an amount equal to four times
his or her annual cash retainer. Any such director who does not meet the threshold will be required to retain 50% of stock acquired through the exercise or vesting of equity awards made by the Company.

 Prior to this offering, executive compensation and related decisions have been made by the Board
of Directors of Omaha Topco. In connection with this offering, our Board of Directors has established a compensation committee that will assume responsibility for establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation and benefit policies.
Except where the context requires otherwise, the terms Board or Board of Directors as used in this Executive and Director Compensation section refer to the Board of Directors of Omaha Topco. 
Transition of Our Executive Compensation Programs 
Our compensation approach is tied to our stage of development. Prior to this offering, we were a privately-held company. As a result, we have
not been subject to any stock exchange listing or SEC rules related to Board and compensation committee structure and function. Prior to Blackstones acquisition of Gates in July 2014, executive compensation practices were tied to immediate
business needs relating to hiring and retaining talent and did not tie specifically to market pay practices. Gates ownership change in 2014 brought leadership changes as well. As new executives were brought into the organization, compensation
decisions took a more market-based pay approach. In 2016, with the Boards approval, we engaged Aon Hewitt, an independent compensation consulting firm (the Consultant), to provide executive compensation consulting services to help
align executive pay with market practices for 2017 executive pay decisions and to advise on executive and director compensation in connection with this offering. The services provided by the Consultant are described more fully in the section
entitled Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant below.  As our executive compensation program evolves as a public
company, it will reflect the belief that the amount earned by our executives must significantly depend on achieving rigorous company and individual performance objectives designed to enhance shareholder value. We have made and intend to continue to
make changes to our executive compensation programs with the goal of aligning our programs with our executive compensation philosophy as a public company. Accordingly, the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers for Fiscal 2017, and the
form and manner in which it was paid, is not necessarily indicative of how we will compensate our Named Executive Officers after this offering. 
The material elements of our executive compensation programs include base salary, an annual, short-term incentive plan that is tied, in part,
to company financial performance, long-term incentive opportunities, broad-based employee benefits, limited perquisites and severance coverage, all of which are described below. Key features of these programs include: 
 


 

 
no incentive funding when Company performance does not meet threshold requirements under our annual short-term incentive plan; and   


 

 
no excise tax gross-ups nor any other tax gross-ups except in the event of relocation.  We
anticipate that we will continue to review our executive compensation programs in connection with this offering and make such changes as are determined to be necessary or appropriate for our status as a public company. As we gain experience as a
public company, we expect that the specific direction, emphasis and components of our executive compensation program will continue to evolve. For more information on changes to our executive compensation program that have made in connection with
this offering, see Actions Taken in Connection with This Offering below.  Executive Compensation Philosophy and Determination Process
 Compensation Philosophy. Our philosophy is to offer an executive compensation program that will enable us to attract,
motivate, reward and retain high-caliber executives who are capable of creating and sustaining value for our shareholders over the long term. In addition, the executive compensation program is designed to provide a fair and competitive compensation
opportunity that appropriately rewards executives for their contributions to our success. We also believe that a significant portion of each executives compensation should be at risk and

   130 




Table of Contents

 
tied to overall Company and individual performance. As described below, we believe that each element of our executive compensation program aligns with this philosophy. 
Role of Board and Management. Our Board has historically taken into account multiple factors, such as considering the
responsibilities, performance, contributions and experience of each Named Executive Officer and compensation in relation to other employees and other equivalent roles. 
In addition, the Board takes into account our Chief Executive Officers judgment and knowledge of our industry when considering
recommendations for executive officer compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer annually reviews each executive officers and Named Executive Officers performance with the Board and recommends an appropriate base salary, annual incentive
target opportunity and annual incentive payout and, if applicable, grant of long-term equity incentive award. Based upon the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer and the other considerations described below and in consideration of the
executive compensation philosophy described above, the Board approves the annual compensation packages of our executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board annually reviews our Chief Executive Officers performance, base salary, annual incentive target opportunity and outstanding
long-term incentive awards and approves any changes to the Chief Executive Officers compensation package in light of such review. Our Chief Executive Officer does not participate in deliberations regarding his own compensation. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant. As described above, we retained the Consultant to support the oversight and
management of our executive compensation program. In late 2016, we compared total direct compensation against market data provided by the Consultant and used it as a reference point to provide a framework for Fiscal 2017 executive compensation
decisions.  In Fiscal 2017, in connection with this offering, the Consultant performed a variety of work, including but not limited to:
assisting in the development of a market-based director compensation program, conducting a review of the competitiveness of our executive compensation program, re-evaluating our executive severance and change-in-control benefit programs, and evaluating a post-IPO long-term equity incentive award program and strategy. See Change
in Control and Severance Benefits and Actions Taken in Connection with This Offering below for additional details on the adoption of our new Executive Severance Plan and Executive Change in Control Plan and executive compensation

 What We Pay and Why: Elements of Compensation 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to recognize an executives scope of responsibilities, leadership ability and
effectiveness in achieving key performance goals and objectives. As an executives level of responsibility within Gates increases, so does the percentage of total compensation that is linked to performance in the form of variable compensation.
We also provide various retirement and benefit programs and modest, business-related benefits as discussed below.  Base Salary.
Base salaries for our Named Executive Officers in 2017 were determined by the Board after consideration of: (1) the Chief Executive Officers recommendations (for all Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer);
(2) breadth, scope and complexity of the executives role; (3) internal equity; (4) current compensation; (5) tenure in position and prior tenure in related roles (excepting Gates); (6) market pay levels; and
(7) individual performance. Base salaries are reviewed annually or at other times when appropriate and may be increased from time to time pursuant to such review. During Fiscal 2017, to reward performance as well as to better align their
compensation to the market, we adjusted the base salary of Mr. Lifsey (from $522,500 to $548,625) and Mr. Gaston (from $370,000 to $385,000). Mr. Naemura had his total target cash compensation pay mix adjusted to align with current
market practices and, as a result, his base salary was adjusted effective March 2017 from $512,500 to $595,000. Ms. Bhattacharyas base salary was not increased in 2017. Ms. Seely was hired in September 2017 at a base salary of
$425,000. Mr. Jureks base salary of $900,000 has not been adjusted since he commenced employment in May 2015. The Summary Compensation Table below shows the base salary earned by each Named Executive Officer during Fiscal 2017. 
Annual Incentive Plan. We provide an annual incentive opportunity under the Gates Global Bonus Plan (the Annual Plan) to
(1) reward certain employees, including our Named Executive Officers, for achieving specific performance goals that would advance our profitability; (2) drive key business results; and (3) recognize individuals based on their
contributions to those results.   Payouts under the 2017 Annual Plan were based on a combination of the achievement of our financial
performance goals in the fiscal year (the Gates Financial Performance Factor), which fund the Annual Plan, and the Named Executive Officers performance during the fiscal year against his or her individual performance goals (the
Individual Performance Factor).   Gates Financial Performance Factor. The Gates Financial Performance Factor sets
the funding levels for the Annual Plan. The Board, after an evaluation of possible financial performance measures, determined to continue to use Adjusted EBITDA (50%) and Operating Cash Flow (30%) as well as Revenue (20%) as the financial
performance measures for 2017. Revenue was included as a performance measure in 2017 to encourage profitable revenue growth. The Board determined that these financial performance measures were critical indicators of our performance for 2017 and,
when combined, contributed to sustainable growth. Financial performance for these measures was determined 100% at a company-wide level. The Annual Plan financial performance measures are described below. 
 








 Performance Measure
  
 Definitions



Adjusted EBITDA (50%)
  
Adjusted EBITDA under the Annual Plan is defined in substantially the same manner as described in SummarySummary Historical Consolidated Financial Information, except it does not reflect certain adjustments,
primarily Sponsor fees, that are not adjusted for under the terms of the Annual Plan.




Operating Cash Flow (30%)
  
Calculated as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined for purposes of the Annual Plan as described immediately above), less capital expenditures, plus or minus the change in average trade working capital.




Revenue (20%)
  
Revenue under the Annual Plan is defined as consolidated revenue as reflected in our financial statements.

 The achievement factor for each of the financial performance measures will be determined by
multiplying the weight attributed to each performance measure by the applicable payout percentage for each measure. For each of the performance measures, payout percentages will be determined by calculating actual achievement against the target goal
based on a pre-established scale. Funding attainment with respect to these performance measures can range from:   


 

 
no funding for performance below the threshold requirement level;   


 

 
50% of target incentive for achieving 95% of the target performance requirement; and   


 

 
150% of target incentive for achieving 105% of the target performance requirement.  If
achievement with respect to any performance measure falls between the threshold and target, or between the target and maximum, earned award amounts for that particular performance measure will be interpolated on a straight-line mathematical basis
(and rounded to the nearest whole number). If achievement with respect to any performance measure does not reach threshold, then that measure will be deemed to have 0% attainment. 
The 2017 target goals for each performance measure are (in millions): Adjusted EBITDA  $612.9; Operating Cash Flow 
$509.6 and Revenue  $2,781.8.  Notwithstanding the establishment of the performance components and the formula for determining
the funding levels as described above, the Board has the ability to exercise positive or negative discretion and award a greater or lesser amount to fund the Annual Plan than the amount determined by the above formula if, in the exercise of its
business judgment, our Board determines that a greater or lesser amount is warranted under the circumstances.  After the Gates Financial
Performance Factor is calculated and the pool is set to fund bonus payouts, our Chief Executive Officer has the discretion to determine how that pool is allocated throughout the organization (excluding with respect to himself). This is
done by adjusting the Gates Financial Performance Factor either upward or downward for each functional area or geographic region based on the performance of that specific region or functional area. 
Individual Performance Factor. Each Named Executive Officers Individual Performance Factor will be determined based on both
financial and non-financial objectives appropriate for each Named Executive Officers position. For 2017, we selected the following individual performance goals for each of our Named Executive Officers: 
 


 

 
Operational Excellence: Improvements in operational efficiency/productivity.   


 

 
Building Organizational Capacity: Increasing talent pipeline within the organization; attracting and developing talent and growing organizational capacity. 
 


 

 
Financial Goals: Achieving our annual financial plan.   Actual amounts paid under the
Annual Plan are calculated by multiplying each Named Executive Officers base salary in effect on December 31, 2017 by (i) his or her Annual Plan target bonus opportunity (which is reflected as a percentage of base salary),
(ii) the final Gates Financial Performance Factor (as adjusted by the Chief Executive Officer) and (iii) the Individual Performance Factor. The 2017 target bonus opportunities for each Named Executive Officer are as follows:
Mr. Jurek  150%; Mr. Naemura  115% (reduced from 150% as part of his total target cash compensation pay mix realignment noted above); Ms. Seely  70% (which will be
pro-rated based on her September 2017 start date); Mr. Gaston  60% and Mr. Lifsey  100%. There is no maximum on the discretionary components of the Annual Plan. We have not yet
calculated our actual performance for Fiscal 2017. We expect to do so, and determine the Fiscal 2017 Annual Plan awards earned by each of our NEOs, in March 2017. 
2018 Annual Plan. The 2018 Annual Plan design is expected to be substantially similar to the 2017 Annual Plan design.

  Sign-on and Discretionary Bonuses. From
time to time, the Board may award sign-on and discretionary bonuses. Sign-on bonuses are used only when necessary to attract highly skilled officers to the Company.
Generally they are used to incentivize candidates to leave their current employers, or may be used to offset the loss of unvested compensation they may forfeit as a result of leaving their current employers. Ms. Seely was provided with an
$180,000 guaranteed sign-on bonus in 2017 in connection with the commencement of her employment that is payable at the same time as the 2017 Annual Plan payments. In connection with Mr. Naemuras
total target cash compensation pay mix realignment, Mr. Naemura received a one-time special cash bonus of $22,212 in order to address the fact that his target bonus annual opportunity was reduced
effective January 1, 2017 and contemplated a full-year base salary at his increased base salary amount, but his actual base salary adjustment was not effective until March 2017. 
Long-Term Incentive. We believe that our Named Executive Officers long-term compensation should be directly linked to the
value we deliver to stockholders. Equity awards to our Named Executive Officers are designed to provide long-term incentive opportunities over a period of several years. We granted executive awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan, permitting our Named
Executive Officers to obtain shares in Omaha Topco. Stock options have been our preferred equity award because the stock options will not have any value unless the underlying shares of common stock appreciate in value following the grant date.
Accordingly, awarding stock options causes more compensation to be at risk and further aligns our executive compensation with our long-term profitability and the creation of shareholder value. 
Historically, grants have not been made on an annual basis, and instead are made upon an executives commencement of employment with us,
when an executive receives a promotion into a more senior-level position or to reward performance. The amounts of each Named Executive Officers stock option grant were determined based on several factors, including: (1) each Named
Executive Officers position and expected contribution to our future growth; (2) dilution effects on stockholders and the need to maintain the availability of an appropriate number of shares for stock option awards to non-executive
employees; and (3) ensuring that our Named Executive Officers were provided with appropriate and competitive total long-term equity compensation. 
The stock options have four equally-weighted tiers. Tier I is subject to a five-year pro rata vesting schedule, and the remaining tiers are
subject to vesting upon Blackstones achievement of specified internal rates of return or multiple of investment targets. Vesting of Tier I may accelerate upon specified events, and, for grants awarded prior to May 2017, vesting of
Tiers II  IV may continue past separation of service upon specified events. For more information regarding the stock options, including the vesting criteria, see the section entitled Narrative Disclosure Relating to the Summary
Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below.  Another key component of our long-term equity incentive program
is that our Named Executive Officers and other eligible employees have been provided with the opportunity to invest in Omaha Topcos common stock. We considered this investment opportunity an important part of our equity program because it
encouraged stock ownership and aligned the investing Named Executive Officers financial interests with those of Omaha Topcos stockholders. As of the date of this offering, Mr. Jurek invested in 195,455 shares; Mr. Naemura
invested in 36,365 shares; and Mr. Gaston invested in 18,182 shares. In connection with Ms. Bhattacharyas departure, her purchased shares were repurchased by Omaha Topco on July 11, 2017 for a purchase price of $180,000,
pursuant to the terms of her subscription agreement.   Fiscal 2017 Grants. Messrs. Jurek and Gaston were awarded stock
option grants under the 2014 Incentive Plan on May 2, 2017 to reward performance as well as to better align their compensation to the market in the amount of 710,400 and 276,100 stock options respectively. The terms and conditions of these
Fiscal 2017 awards were the same as their respective 2016 awards, except that a specified portion of Tiers II  IV will not continue to vest past separation of service upon specified events. Ms. Seely commenced employment as our
Executive Vice President and General Counsel on September 5, 2017 and was granted 550,000 stock options under the 2014 Incentive Plan on September 19, 2017. The terms and conditions of Ms. Seelys option are substantially the
same as Mr. Gastons 2017 stock option award. No other long-term equity incentive awards were granted to the Named Executive Officers in Fiscal 2017. See Equity-Based Awards below for additional details.

  Post-IPO Long-Term Incentive Plan. In connection with this offering, we intend
to implement a new market-based long-term incentive program to align our executive compensation package with similarly situated public companies. See Actions Taken in Connection with This OfferingNew Long-Term Incentive Program and
Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan below for additional details.   Other Aspects of Our Compensation Programs
 Retirement Benefits. We offer the following retirement benefits to eligible U.S.-based employees, including our Named Executive
Officers, as specified below. Additional details about the Gates Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan (the Supplemental Retirement Plan), as it applies to our Named Executive Officers, is included in the 2017 Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation section of this prospectus.   








 Plan
  
 Description



 Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan
  
A qualified defined contribution retirement benefit available to eligible U.S. Employees (as defined in the plan document) that is intended to qualify as a profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Code.




 Supplemental Retirement Plan
  
An unfunded, nonqualified plan that provides our executives, including our Named Executive Officers, benefits similar to the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan but without the Code contribution and earnings limitations.
 We offer a defined contribution retirement benefit to all eligible Gates participants through the Gates
MatchMaker 401(k) Plan. The Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan provides employees with individual retirement accounts funded by (1) an automatic Gates-paid contribution of 3% of employee eligible earnings, and (2) a Gates-paid match on employee
contributions dollar-for-dollar on the first 3% of eligible earnings that the employee contributes. The Code limits employee contributions to the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan to $18,000 ($24,000 for participants over age 50), and earnings upon which
employee/employer contributions may be made are limited to $270,000 in 2017.  We currently offer participation in a nonqualified deferred
compensation retirement plan, through the Supplemental Retirement Plan, to specified employees that include the Named Executive Officers. This plan is an unfunded, nonqualified plan that provides participants with a 6% employer contribution (the
Retirement Contribution) on eligible earnings that exceed Section 401(a)(17) of the Codes dollar limits. In June 2017, we amended the Supplemental Retirement Plan to permit participants to defer up to 80% of base salary
(beginning in January 2018) and 80% of bonus compensation (beginning with the 2017 Annual Plan payouts) and implemented a Rabbi trust to hold plan assets. These deferrals are in addition to amounts participants may defer in the Gates MatchMaker
401(k) Plan. Additional details about the Supplemental Retirement Plan, as it applies to the Named Executive Officers, are included in the 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section of this prospectus. 
Other Benefits. We provide other benefits to the Named Executive Officers that we believe are necessary to compete for executive
talent. The additional benefits for the Named Executive Officers generally consist of a car allowance (which has been phased out for newly hired executives and will be phased out entirely in 2018 for existing participants), a parking
subsidy and an executive annual physical examination. Tax gross-ups are provided to our executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, for certain relocation benefits. The specific amounts attributable to the 2017 other benefits
provided to the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table of this prospectus. 
We also provide other benefits such as medical, dental and short-term disability coverage to each Named Executive Officer, which are identical
to the benefits provided to all other eligible U.S.-based employees. Our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, also receive enhanced benefits that are not available to other employees, such as relocation assistance, and,
effective January 1, 2017, enhanced life, accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) and long-term disability insurance benefits. Specifically, all Named Executive 
   135 




Table of Contents

 
Officers were eligible for enhanced life and AD&D insurance benefits in the following amounts in 2017: 3x base salary up to $2,000,000 (for Messrs Gaston, Naemura and Lifsey and
Mses. Seely and Bhattacharya), and 3x base salary up to $3,000,000 (for Mr. Jurek). In addition, all Named Executive Officers were eligible for enhanced long-term disability insurance benefits of 66.7% of their salary. We provide vacation
and paid holidays to all employees, including the Named Executive Officers. All of the Named Executive Officers were eligible for four weeks of vacation in 2017 except Mr. Gaston, who was eligible for two weeks of vacation. 
Change in Control and Severance Benefits. The Board believes that the Named Executive Officers are better able to perform their duties
with respect to any potential proposed corporate transaction without concern for the impact of the transaction on their individual employment with carefully structured change-in-control and severance benefits. In addition, the Board believes that
the interests of our stockholders are better protected and enhanced by providing greater certainty regarding executive pay obligations in the context of planning and negotiating any potential corporate transactions. We provide limited single-trigger
change-in-control benefits to certain of our Named Executive Officers in their equity grant agreements and pursuant to the Supplemental Retirement Plan. 
In connection with this offering, we have developed a new market-competitive Executive Severance Plan and Executive Change in Control Plan. It
is expected that pursuant to the participation agreements to be executed by our currently employed Named Executive Officers in connection with the Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Plan, each of Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey
will agree to terminate their existing employment agreements with us. Accordingly, the Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Plan will replace the severance benefits provided under the predecessor Gates Corporation Severance Plan to
Mr. Gaston and Ms. Seely and under the employment agreements entered into with Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey. Additional details about the Executive Severance Plan and the Executive Change in Control Plan, as it applies to the
Named Executive Officers, are included below in the Actions Taken in Connection with This Offering section of this prospectus. 
Departure of Ms. Bhattacharya 
Ms. Bhattacharyas employment terminated in July 2017. Her departure constituted a termination without cause pursuant to
the terms of her employment agreement entitling her to the severance benefits described therein. See Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change in ControlDeparture of Ms. Bhattacharya for further details regarding
Ms. Bhattacharyas departure.  Employment Agreements. Upon their commencement of employment, Messrs. Jurek, Naemura
and Lifsey and Ms. Bhattacharya entered into employment agreements that contained substantially similar terms. Each of the employment agreements provided for a five-year initial employment term that extended automatically for additional
one-year periods unless either we or the executive elected not to extend the term. Under the employment agreements, each executive was eligible to receive a minimum base salary, as set forth in the applicable agreement, and annual cash incentive
compensation opportunity based on the achievement of specified financial and individual goals as defined by the Board each year. If these goals were achieved, each executive was eligible to receive a cash bonus. Each Named Executive Officer
was also entitled to participate in all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements made available to other executive officers generally, except that severance benefits were specifically incorporated into the employment agreement. As
discussed above, in connection with the adoption of the Executive Severance Plan and the Executive Change in Control Plan, it is expected that each of Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey will agree to terminate their existing employment
agreements with us. For more information regarding the employment agreements, please see the Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table of this prospectus. 
Other Compensation Practices. In anticipation of becoming a public reporting company, we are in the process of adopting
practices that we believe are important components of a public-company executive compensation program, which are generally described below. 
   136 




Table of Contents

  Section 162(m). In general, Section 162(m) of the Code (Section
162(m)) denies a publicly-held corporation a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes for compensation in excess of $1 million per year per person to the executives designated in Section 162(m), including, but not limited to, its
chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and the next three most highly compensated executives of such corporation whose compensation is required to be disclosed in its proxy statement. Following this offering, we may be able to claim the
benefit of a special exemption rule that applies to compensation paid (or compensation in respect of equity awards such as stock options or restricted stock granted) during a specified transition period. This transition period may extend until the
first annual stockholder meeting held in 2022, unless the transition period is terminated earlier under the post-offering transition rules set forth in Section 162(m). 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. We follow FASB ASC Topic 718 (ASC Topic 718) for our stock-based
compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, based on the grant date fair value of these awards.
This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the
compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. 
Actions Taken in Connection with This Offering 
Assumption of Existing Plans and Awards. We expect that the existing Omaha Topco plans will be assumed by Gates Industrial Corporation
plc in connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions. In connection with such assumption, (i) Omaha Topco options will be converted into Gates Industrial Corporation plc options that (x) reflect an exchange ratio of 0.76293 Gates
Industrial Corporation plc ordinary shares for each outstanding Omaha Topco share and (y) have exercise prices that will be adjusted to ensure that the options received are of equivalent economic value to the legacy Omaha Topco options and (ii)
Omaha Topco restricted stock units will be converted into Gates Industrial Corporation plc restricted stock units that reflect an exchange ratio of 0.76293 Gates Industrial Corporation plc ordinary shares for each outstanding Omaha Topco share. In
addition, directors and executive officers who currently hold shares of Omaha Topco will, like other existing equity owners of Omaha Topco, receive depositary receipts representing ordinary shares of Gates Industrial Corporation plc at the same
ratio of 0.76293 Gates Industrial Corporation plc ordinary shares for each outstanding share of Omaha Topco.   Compensation
Adjustments. As noted above, in Fiscal 2017, with the assistance of the Consultant, we conducted a review of the competitiveness of our executive compensation program. Specifically, we reviewed market data provided by the Consultant consisting
of both our peer group data and data from the Aon Hewitt 2016 Total Compensation Measurement Database® (TCM) (all manufacturing companies with revenues ranging from $1.5 to $6.0 billion).
In order to meet our goal of generally setting total target annual cash compensation (i.e., base salary plus target bonus) for our executive officers between the 50th and the 75th percentile of the market data, we determined it was appropriate to increase the base salaries for Messrs. Jurek, Lifsey and Gaston, effective January 1, 2018, as follows:
Mr. Jurek (from $900,000 to $945,000), Mr. Lifsey (from $548,625 to $610,000) and Mr. Gaston (from $385,000 to $400,000). Mr. Jureks base salary increase also reflects a one-time salary adjustment that was provided to
offset the elimination of automobile allowances beginning in 2018. Effective January 1, 2018, Mr. Nameura also received a similar one-time salary adjustment (from $595,000 to $610,000). In addition, Mr. Gastons 2018 Annual Plan
target opportunity was increased from 60% to 70% of base salary in order to further align his target annual cash compensation with the targeted range of the market data. 
New Long-Term Incentive Program. In connection with this offering, with the assistance of the Consultant, we intend to approve a new
long-term equity incentive program. After reviewing the market data 
   137 




Table of Contents

  
provided by the Consultant, we intend to provide a mix of performance shares, time-based stock options and time-based restricted stock units. Our new long-term equity incentive program will be
informed by the peer group and broader public company practice and will be consistent with our compensation objective of providing a long-term equity incentive opportunity that aligns compensation with the creation of stockholder value and
achievement of business goals.  Executive Severance Plan and Executive Change in Control Plan. As noted above, in Fiscal 2017, with
the assistance of the Consultant, we re-evaluated our executive severance and change-in-control benefit programs. Specifically,
we reviewed both peer group and broader U.S. market data provided by the Consultant. As a result of this review, together with recommendations from the Consultant, we developed a new market-competitive Executive Severance Plan and Executive Change
in Control Plan, which will become effective in connection with this offering. It is expected that pursuant to the participation agreements to be executed by our currently employed Named Executive Officers in connection with the Executive Severance
Plan and Change in Control Plan, each of Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey will agree to terminate their existing employment agreements with us. Accordingly, the Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Plan will replace the severance
benefits provided under the predecessor Gates Corporation Severance Plan to Mr. Gaston and Ms. Seely and under the employment agreements entered into with Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey. 
The Executive Severance Plan provides for severance payments upon certain terminations of employment to our currently employed Named Executive
Officers and other senior executives who are expected to make substantial contributions to our success and thereby provides for stability and continuity of operations. The Named Executive Officers are generally provided with severance payments for a
period of two years for Mr. Jurek (who will receive the sum of two times base salary plus two times previous year bonus), one year for Mr. Naemura (who will receive the sum of one times base salary plus one times previous year bonus) and
two years for the other Named Executive Officers (who will receive two times base salary) should his or her employment be terminated either by us without cause or by the executive for constructive termination. The Executive
Severance Plan also provides for reimbursement for reasonable outplacement and provides health and dental benefit continuation assistance. 
The Executive Change in Control Plan provides double-trigger benefits to Mr. Jurek and all of our executive vice presidents (including
each of the Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Bhattacharya)), regional presidents and select senior vice presidents. The Executive Change in Control Plan serves to encourage these key executives to carry out their duties and provide
continuity of management in the event of a change in control of Gates. The Named Executive Officers are generally provided with payments in the amount of two and one-half times base salary plus
target bonus (for Mr. Jurek) and one and one-half times base salary plus target bonus (for the other participating Named Executive Officers) should his or her employment be terminated either by us without
cause or by the executive for constructive termination within the two-year period following a change in control. The Executive Change in Control Plan also provides for reimbursement for
reasonable outplacement and provides life and long-term disability insurance and health and dental benefit continuation assistance.  The
benefits provided under both the Executive Severance Plan and the Executive Change in Control Plan are contingent upon the affected Named Executive Officers execution and non-revocation of a general
release of claims and compliance with specified restrictive covenants. See Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change in Control, which describes the payments to which each of the Named Executive Officers may be entitled under the
Executive Severance Plan and the Executive Change in Control Plan.  Clawback Policy. We have adopted a clawback policy for
incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee determined that it may be appropriate to recover annual and/or long-term incentive compensation in specified situations. Under the policy, if the Compensation Committee determines that incentive
compensation of its current and former Section 16 officers (or any other current and former employee designated by the Board or the Compensation Committee) was overpaid, in whole or in part, as a result of a restatement of the reported
financial results of the Company or any of its segments due to material non-compliance with financial reporting 
   138 




Table of Contents

  
requirements (unless due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law), and such restatement was caused or contributed, directly or indirectly, by such employees fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence, then the Compensation Committee will determine, in its discretion, whether to seek to recover or cancel any overpayment of incentive compensation paid or awarded based on the inaccurate financial information or
restated results. The clawback policy and our Omnibus Incentive Plan also provide that if a covered person engages in any detrimental activity (as defined in our Omnibus Incentive Plan) as determined by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation
Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for one or more of the following: (i) cancellation of any or all of such covered persons outstanding awards; or (ii) forfeiture by the covered person of any gain realized on the vesting
or exercise of awards, and prompt repayment of any such gain to us.  Stock Ownership Guidelines. In connection with this offering,
we expect to adopt an executive stock ownership program for our Named Executive Officers and other executives that will take effect following this offering. Each of our Named Executive Officers will be expected to own our ordinary shares in the
following amounts:    










Chief Executive Officer
  
5 times base salary

The amounts reported in the Salary column consist of base salary earned in Fiscal 2017. The following base salary increases were provided during 2017: Mr. Naemura (from $512,500 to $595,000),
Mr. Lifsey (from $522,500 to $548,625) and Mr. Gaston (from $370,000 to $385,000). The amount reported for Ms. Bhattacharya represents salary earned through her July 2017 departure date. The amount reported for Ms. Seely

The amount reported for Mr. Naemura represents a one-time special cash bonus in order to address the fact that in connection with his total target cash compensation pay mix
realignment his target bonus annual opportunity was reduced effective January 1, 2017 and contemplated a full year base salary at his increased base salary amount, but his actual base salary adjustment was not effective until March 2017. The
amount reported for Ms. Seely represents her guaranteed sign-on bonus awarded in connection with the commencement of her employment, which amount is payable at the same time as the 2017 Annual Plan
payments. 


(3)
The amounts reported in the Option Awards column for 2017 represent the grant date fair value of the time-vesting options (Tier I) granted to Messrs. Jurek and Gaston and Ms. Seely calculated in
accordance with ASC Topic 718 using a Black-Scholes valuation model. For information regarding the assumptions used in determining the fair value of these awards, please refer to Note 19, Share-Based Compensation of the audited
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. The grant date fair value of the exit-vesting portion of the stock options (Tiers II, III and IV) was computed based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions as
of the grant date in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. Achievement of the performance conditions for these stock options was not deemed probable on the grant date and, accordingly, no value is included in the table for the Tier II, III or IV
exit-vesting portion of the awards pursuant to the SECs disclosure rules. Assuming achievement of the performance conditions, the grant date fair value of Tiers II, III and IV of the awards that were granted in 2017 was:
Mr. Jurek  $470,640 for Tier II, $367,632 for Tier III and $392,496 for Tier IV, Mr. Gaston  $182,916 for Tier II, $142,882 for Tier III and $152,545 for Tier IV and
Ms. Seely  $490,875 for Tier II, $405,625 for Tier III and $360,250 for Tier IV.

The amounts reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column for 2017 are not calculable as of the date of this prospectus. 2017 Annual Plan bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined in
March 2018. The terms of the Annual Plan are described more fully above in the What We Pay and Why: Elements of Compensation-Annual Incentive. In connection with her termination of employment and pursuant to the terms of her employment
agreement, Ms. Bhattacharya is entitled to a pro-rata portion of her 2017 Annual Plan bonus based on our actual performance. 


(5)
The amounts reported in the All Other Compensation column for 2017 reflect the sum of: (1) the amounts contributed by Gates to the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental Retirement Plan,
which are calculated on the same basis for all participants, including the Named Executive Officers; (2) relocation benefits (where applicable); (3) limited tax gross-ups on relocation benefits;
(4) severance payments for Ms. Bhattacharya and (5) the cost of all other executive benefits that are required to be reported by SEC rules. The material provisions of the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan and the Supplemental Retirement
Plan are described in the 2017 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section of this prospectus.

Payments Upon Separation from Service. This column reflects amounts paid to Ms. Bhattacharya following her termination of employment in addition to her pro-rated 2017
Annual Plan bonus. Pursuant to the terms of her employment agreement, in Fiscal 2017, Ms. Bhattacharya received the following: $349,462 representing her severance allowance paid in 2017 (payable in
bi-weekly installments over a 12 months period); a payment of $12,563 for accrued but unused vacation; 12 months of accrued post-separation medical, vision and dental coverage reimbursements of $3,200;
and accrued post-separation outplacement services of $10,000. This column also reflects the $30,000 gain on Ms. Bhattacharyas investment in our shares that were repurchased by us for $180,000 pursuant to the call rights contained in her
subscription agreement. Details regarding Ms. Bhattacharyas separation from service are further described in the Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control section of this prospectus. 


 
(f)
Other Benefits. Certain additional limited benefits are made available to executives, including the Named Executive Officers. The aggregate incremental cost of these benefits is included for each Named Executive
Officer in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table, but the individual values for each item are not required to be disclosed under SEC rules because none of them exceeded the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the
total amount of personal benefits for each Named Executive Officer. In general, these benefits include a car allowance provided to Messrs. Jurek and Naemura and to Ms. Bhattacharya (which has been phased out for new executive officers and will
be phased out for all participants in 2018) and a parking subsidy. Gates also makes available executive physicals to all Named Executive Officers (only used by Messrs. Jurek and Naemura in 2017). Ms. Bhattacharya also received a fitness
reimbursement. Amounts reported also include the full value of the premiums paid by Gates with respect to the enhanced life, AD&D and long-term disability insurance benefits provided to the Named Executive Officers.

 The amounts located in the first row for each Named Executive Officer represent the cash-based award opportunity
range under the 2017 Annual Plan, the terms of which are summarized under What We Pay and Why: Elements of CompensationAnnual Incentive Plan above. For purposes of this table and threshold level disclosure, we assumed that the
lowest weighted of the two performance measures 
   141 




Table of Contents




 

achieved the threshold level of attainment (in other words, 10% of the target award was earned) and the Individual Performance Factor was set at 100%. Additionally, discretion can be used to
reduce the payment to zero. Annual Plan payments, if earned, are contingent upon the Named Executive Officer remaining in continuous employment through the payment date. The calculation uses each Named Executive Officers base salary as of
December 31, other than Ms. Bhattacharya whose calculation uses her base salary in effect on the date of her departure. Ms. Bhattacharyas last day of active service with the Company was July 4, 2017. While the amounts
reported for Ms. Bhattacharya reflect a full year 2017 Annual Plan award opportunity, in connection with her termination of employment and pursuant to the terms of her employment agreement, Ms. Bhattacharya is only entitled to a pro-rata portion of her 2017 Annual Plan bonus based on our actual performance. Details regarding Ms. Bhattacharyas separation from service are further described in the Potential Payments Upon
Termination or Change in Control section of this prospectus. Amounts reported for Ms. Seely represent a pro-rated 2017 Annual Plan bonus based on her September 2017 start date. No amount earned by
each Named Executive Officer for 2017 is included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table as the amounts are not calculable as of the date of this prospectus. Annual Plan bonuses, if
any, are expected to be determined in March 2018.

Represents time-vesting stock options (Tier I) and exit-vesting stock options (Tiers II, III and IV) granted to Messrs. Jurek, Gaston and Ms. Seely in 2017. The grant date fair value of the stock options is
calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718 using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The grant date fair value of the Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting stock options is based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. See Footnote
(3) to the Summary Compensation Table.  Narrative Disclosure Relating to the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based
Awards Table  Employment Agreements 
In connection with their commencement of employment, Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey and Ms. Bhattacharya entered into employment
agreements that contained substantially similar terms. Each of the employment agreements provided for a five-year initial employment term that extended automatically for successive one-year periods unless either Gates or the executive elected not to
extend the term, by providing at least 60 days advance notice.  Each employment agreement established the executives
(1) initial base salary, subject to discretionary periodic increases and (2) eligibility to receive an annual cash incentive bonus, based on the achievement of specified financial and individual performance targets set by the Board each
year. The Annual Plan became effective on January 1, 2016, and all of our Named Executive Officers began participating in the Annual Plan in lieu of the short-term incentive provisions set forth in their respective employment agreements at that
time. The employment agreements also contained severance benefits, as described below.  As discussed above, in connection with the
adoption of the Executive Severance Plan and the Executive Change in Control Plan, it is expected that each of Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey will agree to terminate their existing employment agreements with us. 
The following are the material individual provisions of the employment agreements in effect with Ms. Bhattacharya prior to her departure
and with Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey during Fiscal 2017. In addition, the terms with respect to grants of stock options are described below for our Named Executive Officers in the section entitled Equity-Based Awards.
Severance provisions and agreements, including the severance agreement entered into with Ms. Bhattacharya in connection with her departure from the Company, are described below in the section entitled Potential Payments Upon Termination
or Change in Control.  Mr. Jureks Employment Agreement. Mr. Jureks employment agreement, dated as of
May 18, 2015, provides that he is to serve as our Chief Executive Officer, and is eligible to receive a base salary of $900,000, subject to periodic increases as may be approved by the Board. In addition, Mr. Jurek was entitled to
reimbursement in connection with his and his familys relocation to Denver from Hong Kong, and other assistance to ensure a smooth transition. During the first 12 months of his employment, he was also entitled to reimbursement of reasonable
travel expenses for his spouse and children to the extent they were not based in Denver during such period.  Mr. Naemuras
Employment Agreement. Mr. Naemuras employment agreement, dated as of March 30, 2015, provides that he is to serve as our Chief Financial Officer, and is eligible to receive a base salary of

   142 




Table of Contents

 
$500,000, subject to periodic increases as may be approved by the Board. In addition, Mr. Naemura was entitled to a vehicle allowance in accordance with Gates standard policies in
place for its senior executives from time to time, reimbursement for relocation expenses to Denver from Dallas (which were subject to repayment in the event he voluntarily terminated his employment before March 30, 2016), and eligibility to
participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plan as in effect from time to time.  Mr. Lifseys Employment Agreement.
Mr. Lifseys employment agreement, dated as of August 24, 2015, provides that he is to serve as our Chief Operating Officer, and is eligible to receive a base salary of $475,000, subject to periodic increases as may be approved by the
Board.  Ms. Bhattacharyas Employment Agreement. Ms. Bhattacharyas employment agreement, dated as of
December 19, 2014, provided that she was to serve as Executive Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, and she was eligible to receive a base salary of $350,000, subject to periodic increases as may be approved by the Board. In
addition, Ms. Bhattacharya was entitled to a car/automobile allowance or program in accordance with our standard policies in place for its senior executives from time to time. 
Equity-Based Awards  As noted above, upon
employment or as granted in the Boards discretion, Named Executive Officers received grants of stock options and the ability to purchase shares of Omaha Topco common stock under the 2014 Incentive Plan. The stock options are divided into four
equally weighted tranches referred to as Tiers for vesting purposes. Tier I of the stock options (25% of the total award) is subject to time-based vesting restrictions that vest 20% on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant
date or vesting reference date, as applicable. Tiers II, III and IV (each 25% of the total) are subject to exit-based vesting and will vest and become exercisable if either the specified internal rate of return or multiple of investment targets
noted below are achieved:   


 

 
Tier I Options. Tier I options (25% of the total award) are subject to time-based vesting that vest 20% on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date or vesting reference date, as applicable, subject
to the participants continued employment.   


 

 
Tier II Options. Tier II options (25% of the total award) vest and become exercisable, if, prior to July 3, 2022, and on or after the date that Blackstone has sold at least 25% of the maximum number of the
shares that it held in Omaha Topco to any unaffiliated person or group or has sold all or substantially all of the assets of Omaha Topco to any unaffiliated person or group (any such date, a Liquidity Event), Blackstone receives net cash
proceeds together with any dividends or distributions received, in each case, in respect of its Omaha Topco shares sold that results in either (i) a return of at least 2.0 times the amount of its cumulative invested capital or (ii) an
annual internal rate of return of at least 15% on its cumulative invested capital, in each case, subject to the participants continued employment.   


 

 
Tier III Options. Tier III options (25% of the total award) vest and become exercisable, if, on or after a Liquidity Event, Blackstone receives net cash proceeds together with any dividends or distributions
received, in each case, in respect of its Omaha Topco shares sold that results in either (i) a return of at least 2.5 times the amount of its cumulative invested capital or (ii) an annual internal rate of return of at least 20% on its
cumulative invested capital, in each case, subject to the participants continued employment.   


 

 
Tier IV Options. Tier IV options (25% of the total award) vest and become exercisable at the same time, and subject to the same conditions, as the Tier II Options. However, the Tier IV options have an exercise
price greater than the fair market value of one share of Omaha Topco common stock on the date of grant of such options.  Any
part of a Named Executive Officers stock option award that is vested upon termination of employment by us without Cause or by the Named Executive Officer for good reason (as such terms are defined in the

   143 




Table of Contents

  
stock option agreements), will generally remain outstanding and exercisable for 90 days following the termination of employment. This period is shortened to 30 days if the Named Executive Officer
resigns without good reason and no grounds for a termination by us for Cause exists, and is extended to 12 months if employment is terminated due to death or Disability. Vested options will immediately terminate if the Named Executive Officers
employment is terminated by us for Cause, if the Named Executive Officer resigns without good reason when grounds for Cause exist or if there is a restrictive covenant violation. Any vested options that are not exercised within the applicable
post-termination exercise window will terminate. Any part of a Named Executive Officers stock option award that vests following a termination without Cause, for good reason or due to death or Disability, will generally remain outstanding and
exercisable for 60 days following the date such option vested. In each case, the exercise period will be shortened to the expiration date of the stock option, if earlier. See Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change in
ControlLong-Term Incentive Awards below for a description of the potential vesting that each of these Named Executive Officers may be entitled to in connection with a Change in Control or certain terminations of employment. 
By accepting a grant of options pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan and the stock option award agreement, our Named Executive Officers agreed
to certain restrictive covenants, including an indefinite covenant not to disclose confidential information and not to disparage us, and, during each of the executives employment and for the one-year period following any termination of
employment (or such longer period as the Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive severance payments from us), covenants related to non-competition and non-solicitation of employees, customers or suppliers. 
In addition, as a condition to receiving his or her equity-based awards and in connection with investments in our common stock, each Named
Executive Officer was required to enter into a subscription agreement with us, and to become a party to our shareholders agreement. These agreements generally govern the Named Executive Officers rights with respect to any shares of our common
stock purchased or acquired on exercise of vested stock options. The subscription agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants. 
Following this offering, if a Named Executive Officer materially breaches any of these restrictive covenants contained in the stock option
award agreement, then we have the right to claw back and recover any gains the Named Executive Officer may have realized with respect to his or her shares acquired under the terms of the stock option agreement or pursuant to the
subscription agreement, as applicable. If the Named Executive Officer (i) is terminated for Cause (as defined in the respective Named Executive Officers employment agreements), (ii) voluntarily resigns when grounds exist
for Cause or (iii) violates a restrictive covenant, then we have the right to repurchase his or her shares, including any shares issuable or issued upon the exercise of any options for the lesser of (a) fair market value
(measured as of the purchase date) and (b) cost.

This column reflects 2017 Annual Plan bonuses earned by the Named Executive Officers with respect to the last fiscal year that have been deferred on a voluntary basis. Only Mr. Jurek elected to defer 10% of his
2017 Annual Plan bonus, which deferral amount is not calculable as of the date of this prospectus. 2017 Annual Plan bonuses, if any, are expected to be determined in March 2018. Therefore, Mr. Jureks deferral amount is also not included
in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 


(2)
This column contains contributions by us with respect to the last fiscal year under the Supplemental Retirement Plan, which provides for benefits in excess of amounts permitted to be contributed under our Gates
MatchMaker 401(k) Plan as a result of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. As a result, participants are eligible to receive a retirement contribution paid by the Company in an amount equal to 6% of eligible compensation that exceeds
Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, which is earned in 2017 and paid in the first quarter of 2018. 


(3)
Because amounts included in this column do not include above-market or preferential earnings, none of these amounts are included under the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table.

The following amounts reported in the Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year End column were reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2016: Mr. Jurek: $92,100;
Mr. Naemura: $22,270; Mr. Lifsey: $29,683 and Ms. Bhattacharya: $10,306. As noted above, the amount reported for Mr. Jurek in this column does not reflect his deferral of 10% of his 2017 Annual Plan bonus, which is not calculable
as of the date of this prospectus.

Ms. Seely will not receive a 2017 contribution under the Supplement Retirement Plan with respect to Fiscal 2017 as she was hired in 2017 and her eligible compensation under the Supplemental Retirement Plan in 2017
will not exceed the dollar limits under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code.

Ms. Bhattacharyas last day of active service with the Company was July 4, 2017. Therefore, the Company will distribute the aggregate balance in Ms. Bhattacharyas vested account in the first
quarter of 2018 in accordance with the terms of the Supplemental Retirement Plan.  Narrative to Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation for 2017 Table  We currently offer participation in a nonqualified deferred compensation retirement plan, the
Supplemental Retirement Plan, to specified employees including the Named Executive Officers. This plan is an unfunded, nonqualified plan that provides participants with an employer contribution equal to 6% of eligible compensation that exceeds Code
Section 401(a)(17). Participants must be employed as of the last day of the plan year to be eligible for a Retirement Contribution and are immediately vested in the Retirement Contribution. In June 2017, we amended the Supplemental Retirement
Plan to permit participants to defer up to 80% of base salary (beginning in January 2018) and 80% of bonus compensation (beginning with the 2017 Annual Plan payouts) and implemented a Rabbi trust to hold plan assets. These deferrals are in addition
to amounts participants may defer under the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan. Each Named Executive Officer who participates in the deferral feature of the Supplemental Retirement Plan is 100% vested in that portion of their account that is attributable
to elective deferrals.   The amounts deferred are credited to accounts selected by the Named Executive Officer that mirror the
investment alternatives available in the Gates MatchMaker 401(k) Plan. During Fiscal 2017, participants were permitted to select the investment alternatives in which they wanted their accounts to be deemed to be invested and were credited with
earnings and/or losses based on the performance of the relevant investments. Participants were able to change the investment elections for their accounts on a daily basis during Fiscal 2017. For Fiscal 2017, the Named Executive Officers participated
in one or more of the following 18 investment options, which had the returns indicated below:

A Named Executive Officers vested account will commence to be paid at the earliest to occur of the following events: (1) the
specified date elected by the participant (provided the date specified is at least two years from the end of the Supplemental Retirement Plan year in which the contribution to the Supplemental Retirement Plan is made); (2) the participants
Disability (as defined in the Supplemental Retirement Plan); (3) the participants termination of employment; (4) the participants death; or (5) upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Supplemental Retirement
Plan). If the distribution is made on account of a termination of employment 
   147 




Table of Contents

  
(other than death), the vested account will be distributed in accordance with the form of distribution as elected (a single lump-sum or in annual
installments over two, three, four or five years). If a distribution is made on account of death, the participants vested account will be distributed to his or her beneficiary in a single lump-sum as
soon as practicable following the participants death, regardless of the form of benefit elected. If a distribution is made on account of a termination of employment for any reason other than Disability or death, distribution of a lump-sum or the first installment will be made or begin as soon as possible after the first day of the seventh month following the termination of employment. If a distribution is made on account of Disability
or death, the distribution will be made or begin as soon as possible on the first day of the month following the payment event. If a distribution is made on account of a specified date or Change in Control, the distribution will be made or begin as
soon as is reasonably practical, but in no event later than the last day of the calendar year.   Potential Payments upon a Termination or Change in
Control  Summary of Potential Payments 
We entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey and Ms. Bhattacharya which would provide severance benefits
to such Named Executive Officers in varying amounts under certain scenarios. It is expected that pursuant to the participation agreements to be executed by our currently employed Named Executive Officers in connection with the Executive Severance
Plan and Change in Control Plan, each of Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey will agree to terminate their existing employment agreements with us. Accordingly, the Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Plan will replace the severance benefits
provided under the predecessor Gates Corporation Severance Plan to Mr. Gaston and Ms. Seely and under the employment agreements entered into with Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey. In order to receive payment and benefits under the
Executive Severance Plan or Executive Change in Control Plan, the Named Executive Officer must execute and not revoke a valid release of claims against us and comply with the restrictive covenants set forth in the Executive Severance Plan or
Executive Change in Control Plan, as applicable.  Severance and other benefits that are payable upon a termination of employment or upon a
change in control under the Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Plan are described below. The table following this narrative discussion summarizes the amounts that would have been payable upon termination or a change in control under
certain circumstances to Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Bhattacharya who terminated employment in July 2017), assuming that their employment terminated on December 29, 2017 and assuming the Executive Severance Plan and Change in
Control Plan were in effect on such date. Ms. Bhattacharya has already received and is still receiving severance payments under the Bhattacharya Separation Agreement in connection with the termination of her employment, which payments are
described further below.   Executive Severance Plan. In connection with this offering we will adopt the Executive Severance
Plan. The Executive Severance Plan will provide for severance payments upon certain terminations of employment to our Named Executive Officers and other executive officers who are expected to make substantial contributions to our success and thereby
provide for stability and continuity of operations. All of our currently employed Named Executive Officers will participate in the Executive Severance Plan pursuant to individual participation agreements. 
The Executive Severance Plan provides that, if we terminate the employment of a Named Executive Officer for any reason other than
cause, death or disability, or if the Named Executive Officer terminates other than for a constructive termination, then the Named Executive Officer will be entitled to receive: 
 


 

 
salary continuation payments in an amount equal to the sum of two times base salary and two times previous year bonus for Mr. Jurek, one times base salary and one times previous year bonus for Mr. Naemura and
two times base salary for each other Named Executive Officer;   


 

 
the Named Executive Officers annual bonus under the Annual Plan as earned (without the adjustment for an individual performance factor) for the year in which the separation occurs; 
   148 




Table of Contents




 

 
cash payments in an amount equal to the total amount of Gates portion of the monthly COBRA insurance premiums for participation in the health and dental benefit programs in which the Named Executive Officer
participated immediately prior to separation, payable monthly for each month of the welfare continuation period, which is for a period of 24 months; and    


 

 
reimbursement for reasonable outplacement services which are directly related to the Named Executive Officers termination and which are incurred only during a
six-consecutive month period that ends within or with the 12-month period following the termination of the Named Executive Officers employment. 
For these purposes, cause and constructive termination have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Executive
Severance Plan.   Our Executive Severance Plan contains a best-of-net provision. With a best-of-net provision,
if any of the participants is subject to an excise tax under Code Section 280G and Code Section 4999, then the amount of severance the participant receives may be reduced so that the excise tax does not apply; however, such reduction will
only occur if it results in the receipt of a greater after-tax severance than would otherwise be provided. 
Named Executive Officers are not entitled to payments under the Executive Severance Plan if they are entitled to receive payment under the
Executive Change in Control Plan discussed below. In addition, in order to receive payments under the Executive Severance Plan, the Named Executive Officer must execute and not revoke a release of claims against us and continue to comply with
confidentiality, non-compete, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants during each of the executives employment and for the one-year period following any
termination of employment (or such longer period as the Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive severance payments from us). 
Executive Change in Control Plan. In connection with this offering we will adopt the Executive Change in Control Plan in which
all of our executive officers, including each of our currently employed Named Executive Officers, will participate pursuant to individual participation agreements. The Executive Change in Control Plan serves to encourage these key executives to
carry out their duties and provide continuity of management in the event of a change in control of Gates.  If a change in
control occurs and the Named Executive Officers employment is terminated by us or a successor for reasons other than cause or is terminated voluntarily by the individual for constructive termination, in each case within
the period beginning 90 days prior to the consummation of a change in control and ending on the second anniversary of the date of such change in control, then the Executive Change in Control Plan generally provides that the individual would be
entitled to receive:   


 

 
a lump-sum payment in the amount of two and one-half times base salary plus target bonus amount (for Mr. Jurek) and one and one-half times base salary plus target bonus amount (for the other Named Executive Officers);   


 

 
a lump-sum payment equal to the executives target bonus amount in effect prior to the change in control; 
 


 

 
cash payments in an amount equal to the total amount of the monthly COBRA insurance premiums for participation in the health and dental benefit programs as well as the monthly premiums for the life and long-term
disability insurance benefit programs in which the Named Executive Officer participated immediately prior to separation, payable monthly for each month of the welfare continuation period, which is equal to 30 months for Mr. Jurek and 24 months
for each other participating Named Executive Officer; and   


 

 
reimbursement for reasonable outplacement services which are directly related to the Named Executive Officers termination and which are incurred only during a
six-consecutive month period that ends within or with the 12-month period following the termination of the Named Executive Officers employment.

  For these purposes, change in control, cause and constructive
termination have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Executive Change in Control Plan.   Neither plan contains a single
trigger or a modified single trigger for benefits. In addition, the Executive Change in Control Plan does not provide for benefits upon death or disability following a change in control. 
Our Executive Change in Control Plan contains a
best-of-net provision. With a best-of-net provision, if any of
the participants is subject to an excise tax under Code Section 280G and Code Section 4999, then the amount of severance the participant receives may be reduced so that the excise tax does not apply; however, such reduction will only occur
if it results in the receipt of a greater after-tax severance than would otherwise be provided. 
To the extent a payment or benefit that is paid or provided under the Executive Change in Control Plan would also be paid or provided under
the terms of another plan, program, agreement, arrangement or legal requirement, the executive would be entitled to payment under the Executive Change in Control Plan or such other applicable plan, program, agreement, arrangement or legal
requirement, whichever provides for greater benefits, but would not be entitled to benefits under both the Executive Change in Control Plan and such other plan, program, agreement, arrangement or legal requirement. 
In addition, in order to receive payment and benefits under the Executive Change in Control Plan, the Named Executive Officer must execute and
not revoke a release of claims against Gates and continue to comply with confidentiality, non-compete and non-solicitation covenants during each of the executives
employment and for the one-year period following any termination of employment (or such longer period as the Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive severance payments from us). 
Annual Plan   Messrs. Jurek, Naemura,
Lifsey and Gaston, and Ms. Seely participated in the Annual Plan. For Fiscal 2017, the Annual Plan provided that a participant had to be an employee at the time of a payout in order to receive a payout under the Annual Plan, except (i) in
the case of death, Disability (as defined in the Annual Plan) or Retirement (as defined in the Annual Plan), (ii) if such payment was required by local law or individual employment agreement, or (iii) under the terms of a Gates-approved
severance arrangement (referred to as Termination with Severance). In the case of death, Disability or Retirement, the bonus payout would have been calculated based on the target achievement of annual financial performance targets
(without the adjustment for an individual performance factor), and prorated to reflect the number of full months worked for us by the participant in the year of such termination. In the case of Termination with Severance, the bonus payout would have
been calculated in accordance with the Executive Severance and Change in Control Plans, as applicable.

 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
For Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey, vesting of one additional tranche of the Tier I time-vesting options will accelerate upon
termination of employment by (i) the Company without Cause, (ii) by the participant for Good Reason and (iii) death or Disability ((i)(iii) collectively referred to as a Good Leaver Termination). In addition,
for all Named Executive Officers with options granted prior to May 2017, with respect to the Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting options, if there is a separation from service due to a Good Leaver Termination prior to July 3, 2022, then a
percentage of such options equal to the Specified Portion listed below will remain outstanding and eligible to vest for a period ending on the earlier of (x) the date that is 24 months following the date of termination or

 In addition, for options granted prior to May 2017 if the participant retires on or after the third
anniversary of the vesting commencement date, is at least age 62 and has completed three years of service, then the Board may, in its discretion, treat such retirement as a Good Leaver Termination with respect to Tiers II, III and IV. 
For all option awards, upon a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the 2014 Incentive Plan) during the participants
employment, all unvested Tier I time-vesting options will accelerate and become fully vested. The Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting options would not automatically become fully vested in connection with a Change in Control. However, all or a portion
of the Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting options may become vested to the extent a Change in Control occurs prior to July 3, 2022, which results in the applicable vesting conditions being met. If not, then the Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting
options would remain outstanding and eligible to vest until July 3, 2022, or until Blackstone ceases to own any of our ordinary shares. 
Retirement Benefits  The Supplemental
Retirement Plan that is made available to all Named Executive Officers has payment provisions relating to the termination of employment with Gates and a Change in Control (as defined in the Supplemental Retirement Plan), which are described more
fully above under Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal 2017.  Payments and Benefits Upon Termination or Change-in-Control

Amounts reported reflect a pro-rata portion of the Annual Plan bonus based on the target achievement of annual financial and individual performance targets. 


(2)
For Messrs. Jurek, Naemura and Lifsey, if the executives employment is terminated by the Company without Cause, by the executive for Good Reason or as a result of death or Disability, then vesting of one
additional tranche of the Tier I time-vesting options will accelerate. In the event of a Change in Control, all such unvested Tier I time-vesting options will accelerate and become fully vested. The amounts reported reflect the
spread value for the Tier I time-vesting options granted prior to Fiscal 2017, in each case representing the difference between the midpoint of the price range indicated on the front cover of this prospectus and the applicable exercise
price. Amounts reported assume that Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting options do not vest upon a Change in Control. 


(3)
 For Messrs. Jurek and Naemura, the amounts reported reflect the sum of (a) a pro rata portion of the 2017
Annual Plan bonus payment assuming target achievement of annual financial targets (without the adjustment for an individual performance factor) since the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan is not calculable as of the date of this prospectus and (b) two
times Mr. Jureks and one times Mr. Naemuras (x) then-current base salary and (y) the actual Fiscal 2016 Annual Plan bonus payment, which would be paid in substantially equal installments over a period of 24 months for
Mr. Jurek and 12 months for Mr. Naemura. For the 
   152 




Table of Contents




 

remaining Named Executive Officers, the amount reported is (a) two times his or her then-current base salary and (b) a pro rata portion of the Fiscal 2017 Annual Plan bonus assuming
target achievement of annual financial targets (without the adjustment for an individual performance factor) since the 2017 Annual Bonus Plan is not calculable as of the date of this prospectus, which would be paid in substantially equal
installments over a period of 24 months. 


(4)
The amounts reported in TerminationBy the Company without Cause represent cash payments in an amount equal to the estimated total amount of Gates portion of the monthly COBRA insurance premiums
for participation in the health and dental benefit programs in which the Named Executive Officer participated immediately prior to termination for a period of 24 months for each of the Named Executive Officers. The amounts reported in Change-in-Control(with Termination) represent cash payments in an amount equal to the estimated total amount of the monthly COBRA insurance premiums for
participation in the health and dental benefit programs as well as the monthly premiums for the life and long-term disability insurance programs in which the Named Executive Officer participated immediately prior to termination for a period of
30 months for Mr. Jurek and 24 months for each of the other Named Executive Officers. 


(5)
Amounts reported represent costs of outplacement services for a six-month period for each executive assuming rates in effect at December 29, 2017. 


(6)
The amounts reported reflect the sum of (a) one and one-half times (two and one-half times for Mr. Jurek) the executives
then-current base salary plus the Fiscal 2017 Annual Plan target bonus and (b) the Fiscal 2017 Annual Plan target bonus. Our Executive Change in Control Plan provides that if the executive is subject to an excise tax under Code
Section 280G and Code Section 4999 then the amount of severance the executive receives may be reduced so that the excise tax does not apply, however, such reduction will only occur if the receipt of a greater
after-tax severance than would otherwise be provided. For purposes of the above disclosure we have assumed that the executives severance amounts will not be reduced. 
Departure of Ms. Bhattacharya 
Ms. Bhattacharyas last day of active service with us was July 4, 2017. In connection with Ms. Bhattacharyas
termination of employment with us, she entered into the Bhattacharya Separation Agreement. Ms. Bhattacharyas departure from employment with us constituted a termination without Cause pursuant to the terms of her employment
agreement entitling her to (a) severance pay in the amount of $826,000, which will be paid in equal installments over the 12 months following her termination of employment with us (the severance pay equals (the sum of (i) her annual
base salary of $350,000, and (ii) an amount equal to her annual bonus in respect of our 2016 fiscal year of $476,000), (b) $7,563 paid in equal installments over 12 months following her termination of employment with us, which represents
the estimated annual cost of our portion of continuation of medical, dental and vision under COBRA, (c) outplacement services up to $10,000, for a six-month consecutive period that ends within or with the 12-month period following her
termination of employment with us, and (d) a pro rata portion of her annual bonus in respect of our 2017 fiscal year, based on our actual performance (the 2017 Bonus and together with (a), (b) and (c), the Bhattacharya
Severance Benefits). The amount to be paid in respect of Ms. Bhattacharyas 2017 Bonus will be determined and paid at the same time annual bonuses in respect of our 2017 fiscal year are determined and paid with respect to our senior
executives.  For purposes of her existing option award agreement, her departure constituted a Good Leaver Termination,
entitling her to vest in an additional 17,760 Tier I time-vesting stock options and to remain eligible to vest in 80% of her unvested Tier II, III and IV exit-vesting stock options for 24 months following her departure date. All other unvested stock
options were immediately forfeited. In addition, Ms. Bhattacharya had the right to exercise all of her vested and deemed vested stock options within 90 days of her departure date, which were not exercised and were cancelled. In addition,
pursuant to the terms of her subscription agreement, her purchased shares were repurchased by us on July 11, 2017 for a purchase price of $180,000, resulting in a gain of $30,000. 
The Bhattacharya Severance Benefits were contingent upon Ms. Bhattacharyas execution and non-revocation of a release of
claims in our favor (which we received) and her continued compliance with certain 
   153

non-competition, non-solicitation, non-disparagement and confidentiality covenants contained in the Bhattacharya Separation Agreement. The confidentiality and non-disparagement
covenants each have an indefinite term. The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants each have a term of 12 months. If we believe that Ms. Bhattacharya is in violation of these restrictive covenants after her termination, we may suspend
all of the payments described above. However, we also have the right to waive a breach of any covenant by Ms. Bhattacharya.  Equity
Incentive Plans  Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2014 Stock Incentive Plan 
On January 9, 2015, we adopted 2014 Omaha Topco Ltd. Stock Incentive Plan, referred to herein as the 2014 Incentive Plan. In connection
with the pre-IPO reorganization, the 2014 Incentive Plan will be assumed by Gates Industrial Corporation plc and renamed the Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. 
Following the offering, regular equity-based awards will no longer be granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan; however, the Board may approve
special grants from time to time in its discretion until a new stock incentive plan is approved. Any outstanding stock options granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan prior to the offering will remain outstanding in accordance with the terms of the
2014 Incentive Plan. New equity-based awards will be granted under the new stock incentive plan, which we intend to adopt in connection with this offering. The following description sets forth the material terms of the 2014 Incentive Plan, which is
incorporated herein by reference.  Purpose. The purpose of the 2014 Incentive Plan is to aid Omaha Topco and its affiliates
in recruiting and retaining key employees, directors, other service providers, or independent contractors and to motivate such employees, directors, other service providers, or independent contractors to exert their best efforts on behalf of Omaha
Topco and its affiliates by providing incentives through the granting of Awards (as defined below).  Awards. Incentive
awards granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan (Awards) may include grants of non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards, including restricted shares of Omaha Topco common stock, restricted stock
units, and the opportunity to purchase shares of Omaha Topco common stock. The number of shares of Omaha Topco common stock subject to the 2014 Incentive Plan is 35,555,556. 
Eligibility. Awards may be granted to employees, directors, other service providers, or independent contractors of Omaha Topco
or its affiliates who are selected by the compensation committee (the Omaha Committee) of the board of directors of Omaha Topco (the Omaha Board) or a sub-committee thereof or such other committee thereof to which the Omaha
Board has delegated power to act under or pursuant to the provisions of 2014 Incentive Plan and if no such committee has been created, the Omaha Board to participate in the 2014 Incentive Plan. 
Administration. The 2014 Incentive Plan is administered by the Omaha Committee, which may delegate its duties and powers in
whole or in part to any sub-committee or to any employee or group of employees of Omaha Topco or an affiliate; provided that such delegation and grants are consistent with applicable law and guidelines established by the Omaha Board from time to
time. Awards may, in the discretion of the Omaha Committee, be made under the 2014 Incentive Plan in assumption of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by Omaha Topco or its affiliates or a company acquired by Omaha Topco
or with which Omaha Topco combines. The number of shares of Omaha Topco stock underlying such substitute awards will be counted against the aggregate number of shares of Omaha Topco stock available for Awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan. 
The Omaha Committee is authorized to correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2014 Incentive Plan or any
award agreement in the manner and to the extent the Omaha Committee deems 
   154 




Table of Contents

 
necessary or desirable without the consent of any participant. Any decision of the Omaha Committee in the interpretation and administration of the 2014 Incentive Plan, as described herein, lies
within its sole and absolute discretion and will be final, conclusive and binding on all parties concerned (including, but not limited to, participants and their beneficiaries or successors). The Omaha Committee has the full power and authority
in its sole discretion to make any determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2014 Incentive Plan. In particular, the Omaha Committee has the authority in its sole discretion to exercise all of the powers
granted to it under the 2014 Incentive Plan; to construe and interpret the 2014 Incentive Plan and any award agreement; to amend the 2014 Incentive Plan to reflect changes in applicable law; to grant Awards and determine who will receive Awards,
when such Awards will be granted, and establish the terms and conditions of such Awards consistent with the provisions of the 2014 Incentive Plan, including to determine the number of shares of Omaha Topco stock to be covered by each such Award so
granted; to waive any such terms and conditions at any time (including, without limitation, accelerating or waiving any vesting conditions); to establish, amend and rescind any rules and regulations relating to the 2014 Incentive Plan; and to make
any other determinations that it deems necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2014 Incentive Plan.  Stock Options and
Stock Appreciation Rights. Options granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan are non-qualified stock options for federal income tax purposes. The exercise price is determined by the Omaha Committee, provided that for purposes of an option
granted to a participant who is a U.S. or Canadian taxpayer the exercise price per share of Omaha Topco common stock will not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value (as defined in the 2014 Incentive Plan) of a share of Omaha Topco common stock
on the date the option is granted. Options granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan are exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as determined by the Omaha Committee, but in no event are options be exercisable more than ten years
after the date it is granted.  An option may be exercised by paying the exercise price in cash or its equivalent (e.g., by personal
check); in shares of Omaha Topco stock (subject to such requirements as may be established by the Omaha Committee); partly in cash and partly in shares of Omaha Topco stock which, in the aggregate, have a value equal to the aggregate exercise price
of the shares of Omaha Topco stock being purchased; if there is a public market for the shares of Omaha Topco stock at such time, to the extent specified in an award agreement or otherwise permitted by and subject to rules of Omaha Topco, through
the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker to sell shares of Omaha Topco stock obtained upon the exercise of the option and to deliver to Omaha Topco an amount equal to the exercise price; or using a net settlement mechanism whereby the
number of shares of Omaha Topco stock delivered upon the exercise of the option will be reduced by a number of shares of Omaha Topco stock that has a Fair Market Value equal to the exercise price, provided that, in each case, the participant tenders
cash or its equivalent to pay any applicable withholding or other applicable taxes (unless otherwise permitted by Omaha Topco).  The Omaha
Committee may also grant stock appreciation rights independent of or in connection with an option. A stock appreciation right granted in connection with an option may be granted at the time the related option is granted or at any time prior to the
exercise or cancellation of the related option, will cover the same number of shares of Omaha Topco stock covered by an option (or such lesser number of shares of Omaha Topco stock as the Omaha Committee may determine), and will be subject to the
same terms and conditions as such option, except for certain additional limitations imposed by the 2014 Incentive Plan.  The exercise
price per share of Omaha Topco common stock of a stock appreciation right will be an amount determined by the Omaha Committee, provided that for the purposes of a stock appreciation right granted to a participant who is a U.S. or Canadian taxpayer,
the exercise price will be at least 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Omaha common stock on the date the stock appreciation right is granted. Generally, each stock appreciation right will entitle the participant upon exercise to an amount
equal to (i) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value of one share of Omaha Topco common stock on the exercise date over (B) the exercise price, times (ii) the number of shares of Omaha Topco stock covered by the stock
appreciation right. Payment to the participant will be made in shares of Omaha Topco stock or in cash or partly in shares of Omaha Topco stock and 
   155 




Table of Contents

 
partly in cash (any shares of Omaha Topco stock valued at Fair Market Value), all as will be determined by the Omaha Committee. 
Other Stock-Based Awards. The Omaha Committee, in its sole discretion, may grant or sell Awards of shares of Omaha Topco stock,
restricted shares of Omaha Topco stock, restricted stock units, and Awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on the Fair Market Value of, shares of Omaha Topco stock. Such other stock-based awards will be in
such form, and dependent on such conditions, as the Omaha Committee determines, including, without limitation, the right to receive, or vest with respect to, one or more shares of Omaha Topco stock (or the equivalent cash value of such shares of
Omaha Topco stock) upon the completion of a specified period of service, the occurrence of an event and/or the attainment of performance objectives. 
Adjustment Upon Certain Events. In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Omaha Topco stock after the effective
date of the 2014 Incentive Plan by reason of an extraordinary share distribution or split, recapitalization, rights offering, split-up or spin-off, or any other event that constitutes an equity restructuring within the meaning of ASC
Topic 718, the Omaha Committee will adjust the 2014 Incentive Plan and outstanding Awards as it deems necessary, in good faith, to prevent dilution or enlargement of rights immediately resulting from such event or transaction (or in order to
preserve the economic value of the outstanding Awards and the value that may be delivered pursuant to outstanding Awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan) with such adjustments to be made in such manner as the Omaha Committee may determine in its sole
discretion. Such actions may include adjustment of the number and kind of shares that may be delivered under the 2014 Incentive Plan; adjustment of the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards; adjustment of the exercise price of
outstanding Awards or the measure to be used to determine the amount of the benefit payable on an Award, payment of an amount in cash to the holder of the Award, and any other adjustments that the Omaha Committee determines to be equitable. Upon a
stock split, a reverse stock split, or a declaration of a dividend payable in shares of Omaha Topco stock, the number of shares of Omaha Topco stock authorized under the 2014 Incentive Plan and the number of shares of Omaha Topco stock subject to
each Award will be automatically adjusted without any additional action by the Omaha Committee.  In the event of any change in the
outstanding shares of Omaha Topco stock after the effective date of the 2014 Incentive Plan by reason of any reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of Omaha Topco stock or other securities of Omaha
Topco, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase shares of Omaha Topco stock or other securities of Omaha Topco, extraordinary dividend, distribution or return of capital or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the shares
of Omaha Topco stock such that an adjustment is determined by the Omaha Committee in good faith to be appropriate or desirable (including, without limitation, in order to preserve the economic value of the outstanding Awards and the value that may
be delivered pursuant to outstanding Awards under the 2014 Incentive Plan, the Omaha Committee in its sole discretion and without liability to any person will make such substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems to be equitable, as to
(i) the number of shares of Omaha Topco stock or other securities of Omaha Topco with respect to which Awards have or may be granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan, (ii) the terms of any outstanding Award, including (A) the number of
shares of Omaha Topco stock or other securities of Omaha Topco subject to outstanding Awards or to which outstanding Awards relate and (B) the exercise price of any option or stock appreciation right, and/or (iii) any other affected terms
of such Awards.  In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the 2014 Incentive Plan) after the effective date of the 2014
Incentive Plan, (i) if determined by the Omaha Committee in the applicable Award agreement or otherwise, any outstanding Awards then held by participants which are unexercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions will
automatically be deemed exercisable or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions, as the case may be, as of immediately prior to such Change in Control and (ii) the Omaha Committee may, but will not be obligated to,
(A) accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to all or any portion of an Award, (B) cancel such Awards for fair value (as determined in the sole discretion of the Omaha Committee) which, in the case of options and
stock appreciation rights, may equal the excess, if any, of value of 
   156 




Table of Contents

 
the consideration to be paid in the Change in Control transaction to holders of the same number of shares of Omaha Topco stock subject to such options or stock appreciation rights (or, if no
consideration is paid in any such transaction, the Fair Market Value of the shares of Omaha Topco stock subject to such options or stock appreciation rights) over the aggregate exercise price of such options or stock appreciation rights (and, for
the avoidance of doubt, any options and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is greater than or equal to the per share consideration to be paid or Fair Market Value per share in such Change in Control transaction may be cancelled or
no consideration), (C) provide for the issuance of substitute Awards or the assumption or replacement of Awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected Awards previously granted hereunder as determined by
the Omaha Committee in its sole discretion whether by any successor or survivor entity, or a parent or affiliate thereof, or (D) provide that for a period of at least seven days prior to the Change in Control, such Awards will be exercisable,
to the extent applicable, as to all shares of Omaha Topco stock subject thereto and, to the extent not exercised, the Omaha Committee may further provide that upon the occurrence of the Change in Control, such Awards will terminate and be of no
further force and effect.  Amendment and Termination. The Omaha Board may amend, alter or discontinue the 2014 Incentive
Plan, but not (a) without the approval of the shareholders of Omaha Topco, if such action would, subject to certain exceptions, increase the total number of shares of Omaha Topco stock reserved for the purposes of the 2014 Incentive Plan, or
(b) without the consent of participants holding a majority of the economic interests of the affected participants, if such action would materially diminish the rights of such affected participants under the Awards; provided, however, that Omaha
Topco may (x) amend the 2014 Incentive Plan as it deems necessary to permit the granting of Awards meeting the requirements of the Code or other applicable laws, and (y) amend any outstanding Awards in a manner that is not materially
adverse to a participant, except as may be permitted as described under the section Adjustments Upon Certain Events above. 
Clawback/Forfeiture. Certain subscription agreements and stock option agreements issued pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan
contain clawback provisions, as described above under the section Equity-Based Awards above.  Gates Industrial Corporation plc
2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan  In connection with this offering, our Board of Directors expects to adopt, and we expect our shareholders
to approve, our Omnibus Incentive Plan prior to the completion of the offering. The term Board of Directors as used in this Gates Industrial Corporation plc 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan section refers to the Board of Directors
of Gates Industrial Corporation plc.  Purpose. The purpose of our Omnibus Incentive Plan is to provide a means through which
to attract and retain key personnel and to provide a means whereby our directors, officers, employees, consultants, and advisors can acquire and maintain an equity interest in us, or be paid incentive compensation, including incentive compensation
measured by reference to the value of our ordinary shares, thereby strengthening their commitment to our welfare and aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. 
Administration. Our Omnibus Incentive Plan will be administered by the compensation committee of our Board of Directors, or such
other committee of our Board of Directors to which it has properly delegated power, or if no such committee or subcommittee exists, our Board of Directors (such administering body referred to herein as the Committee). Except to the
extent prohibited by applicable law or the applicable rules and regulations of any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system on which our securities are listed or traded, the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its
responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any part of its responsibilities and powers to any person or persons selected by it in accordance with the terms of our Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Committee is
authorized to: (i) designate participants; (ii) determine the type or types of awards to be granted to a participant; (iii) determine the number of ordinary shares to be covered by, or with respect to which payments, rights, or other matters are to
be 
   157

calculated in connection with, awards; (iv) determine the terms and conditions of any award; (v) determine whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances awards may be settled in, or
exercised for, cash, ordinary shares, other securities, other awards or other property, or canceled, forfeited or suspended and the method or methods by which awards may be settled, exercised, canceled, forfeited or suspended; (vi) determine
whether, to what extent, and under what circumstances the delivery of cash, ordinary shares, other securities, other awards, or other property and other amounts payable with respect to an award will be deferred either automatically or at the
election of the participant or of the Committee; (vii) interpret, administer, reconcile any inconsistency in, correct any defect in, and/or supply any omission in our Omnibus Incentive Plan and any instrument or agreement relating to, or award
granted under, our Omnibus Incentive Plan; (viii) establish, amend, suspend, or waive any rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Committee may deem appropriate for the proper administration of our Omnibus Incentive Plan; (ix) adopt
sub-plans; and (x) make any other determination and take any other action that the Committee deems necessary or desirable for the administration of our Omnibus Incentive Plan. Unless otherwise expressly provided in our Omnibus Incentive Plan, all
designations, determinations, interpretations, and other decisions under or with respect to our Omnibus Incentive Plan or any award or any documents evidencing awards granted pursuant to our Omnibus Incentive Plan are within the sole discretion of
the Committee, may be made at any time, and are final, conclusive, and binding upon all persons or entities, including, without limitation, us, any participant, any holder or beneficiary of any award, and any of our shareholders. 
Awards Subject to our Omnibus Incentive Plan. Our Omnibus Incentive Plan provides that the total number of ordinary shares that
may be issued under our Omnibus Incentive Plan is 12,500,000, or the Absolute Share Limit; provided, however, that the Absolute Share Limit shall be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2019 fiscal year in an
amount equal to the least of (x) 6,500,000 ordinary shares, (y) 2.5% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, and (z) a lower number of ordinary shares as determined by the
board. Of this amount, the maximum number of ordinary shares for which incentive stock options may be granted is 12,500,000; and during a single fiscal year, each non-employee director shall be granted a number of ordinary shares subject to awards,
taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-employee director during the fiscal year, equal to a total value of $1 million or such lower amount as determined by the board. Except for Substitute Awards (as described below), to the extent
that an award expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated without issuance to the participant of the full number of ordinary shares to which the award related, the unissued shares will again be available for grant under our Omnibus Incentive
Plan. Ordinary shares will be deemed to have been issued in settlement of awards if the fair market value equivalent of such shares is paid in cash in connection with such settlement; provided, however, that no shares will be deemed to have been
issued in settlement of a stock appreciation right or restricted stock unit that provides for settlement only in cash and settles only in cash or in respect of any other cash-based awards. Ordinary shares that are tendered or withheld on exercise of
options or other award for the payment of the exercise or purchase price or withholding taxes, not issued upon the settlement of a stock appreciation right that by the terms of the award agreement would settle in ordinary shares (or could settle in
ordinary shares), or purchased on the open market with cash proceeds from the exercise of options, will not again become available for other awards under our Omnibus Incentive Plan. No award may be granted under our Omnibus Incentive Plan after the
tenth anniversary of the Effective Date (as defined in our Omnibus Incentive Plan), but awards granted before then may extend beyond that date. Awards may, in the sole discretion of the Committee, be granted in assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding awards previously granted by an entity directly or indirectly acquired by us or with which we combine, or Substitute Awards, and such Substitute Awards will not be counted against the Absolute Share Limit, except that Substitute Awards
intended to qualify as incentive stock options will count against the limit on incentive stock options described above. 
Options. Under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, the Committee may grant non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options with
terms and conditions determined by the Committee that are not inconsistent with our Omnibus Incentive Plan; provided, that all stock options granted under our Omnibus Incentive Plan are required to have a per share exercise price that is not less
than 100% of the fair market value of our ordinary shares underlying such stock options on the date such stock options are granted (other than in the case of options that 
   158 




Table of Contents

 
are Substitute Awards), and all stock options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock options must be granted pursuant to an award agreement expressly stating that the options are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options, and will be subject to the terms and conditions that comply with the rules as may be prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. The maximum term for stock options granted under our Omnibus Incentive Plan
will be ten years from the initial date of grant, or with respect to any stock options intended to qualify as incentive stock options, such shorter period as prescribed by Section 422 of the Code. However, if a non-qualified stock option would
expire at a time when trading of our ordinary shares is prohibited by our insider trading policy (or blackout period imposed by us), the term will automatically be extended to the 30th day following the end of such period. The purchase
price for the ordinary shares as to which a stock option is exercised may be paid to us, to the extent permitted by law (i) in cash or (ii) by such other method as the Committee may permit in its sole discretion, including, without limitation: (a)
if there is a public market for the ordinary shares at such time, by means of a broker-assisted cashless exercise pursuant to which we are delivered (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Committee) a copy of
irrevocable instructions to a stockbroker to sell the ordinary shares otherwise issuable upon the exercise of the option and to deliver promptly to us an amount equal to the exercise price or (b) a net exercise procedure effected by the
settlement of the award in a combination of: (i) ordinary shares otherwise issuable; and (ii) cash, where the amount of cash is sufficient to pay the exercise price and all applicable required withholding and any other applicable taxes required to
be withheld. Any fractional ordinary shares shall be settled in cash.  Stock Appreciation Rights. The Committee may grant
stock appreciation rights, under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, with terms and conditions determined by the Committee that are not inconsistent with our Omnibus Incentive Plan. The Committee also may award stock appreciation rights independent of any
option. Generally, each stock appreciation right will entitle the participant upon exercise to an amount (in cash, ordinary shares, or a combination of cash and shares, as determined by the Committee) equal to the product of (i) the excess of (a)
the fair market value on the exercise date of one ordinary share over (b) the strike price per ordinary share covered by the stock appreciation right, times (ii) the number of ordinary shares covered by the stock appreciation right, less any taxes
required to be withheld. The strike price per ordinary share covered by a stock appreciation right will be determined by the Committee at the time of grant but in no event may such amount be less than 100% of the fair market value of an ordinary
share on the date the stock appreciation right is granted (other than in the case of stock appreciation rights granted in substitution of previously granted awards). 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may grant restricted shares of our ordinary shares or restricted
stock units, representing the right to receive, upon vesting and the expiration of any applicable restricted period, one ordinary share for each restricted stock unit, or, in the sole discretion of the Committee, the cash value thereof (or any
combination thereof). As to restricted shares of our ordinary shares, subject to the other provisions of our Omnibus Incentive Plan, the holder will generally have the rights and privileges of a shareholder as to such restricted shares of ordinary
shares, including, without limitation, the right to vote such restricted ordinary shares.   Other Equity-Based Awards and Other
Cash-Based Awards. The Committee may grant other equity-based or cash-based awards under our Omnibus Incentive Plan, with terms and conditions determined by the Committee that are not inconsistent with our Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Effect of Certain Events on Our Omnibus Incentive Plan and Awards. In the event of (i) any dividend (other than regular cash
dividends) or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, ordinary shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, split-off, spin-off,
combination, repurchase, or exchange of ordinary shares or other securities, issuance of warrants or other rights to acquire ordinary shares or other securities, or other similar corporate transaction or event that affects the ordinary shares
(including a Change in Control, as defined in our Omnibus Incentive Plan); or (ii) unusual or nonrecurring events affecting us, including changes in applicable rules, rulings, regulations, or other requirements, that the Committee determines, in its
sole discretion, could result in substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights intended to be granted to, or available for, participants 
   159 




Table of Contents

  
(any event in (i) or (ii), an Adjustment Event), the Committee will, in respect of any such Adjustment Event, make such proportionate substitution or adjustment, if any, as it deems
equitable, to any or all of (a) the Absolute Share Limit, or any other limit applicable under our Omnibus Incentive Plan with respect to the number of awards which may be granted thereunder; (b) the number of our ordinary shares or other of our
securities (or number and kind of other securities or other property) which may be issued in respect of awards or with respect to which awards may be granted under our Omnibus Incentive Plan or any sub-plan; and (c) the terms of any outstanding
award, including, without limitation, (x) the number of our ordinary shares or other of our securities (or number and kind of other securities or other property) subject to outstanding awards or to which outstanding awards relate; (y) the exercise
price or strike price with respect to any award; or (z) any applicable performance measures; provided, that in the case of any equity restructuring, (within the meaning of the FASB ASC Topic 718 (or any successor pronouncement
thereto)) the Committee will make an equitable or proportionate adjustment to outstanding awards to reflect such equity restructuring; and provided, further, that, except as otherwise provided by the Committee, whether in an award agreement or
otherwise, in the event of a termination of a participants employment or service, or a Termination, within the two-year period following a Change in Control by the participant without cause (as defined in our Omnibus Incentive
Plan) (excluding a Termination due to death or disability or any voluntary Termination by the participant), all awards held by such participant will become fully vested upon such Termination. In connection with any Adjustment Event, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, provide for any one or more of the following: (i) substitution or assumption of awards, acceleration of the exercisability of, lapse of restrictions on, or termination of, awards or a period of time for participants to
exercise outstanding awards prior to the occurrence of such event; and (ii) subject to any limitations or reductions as may be necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, cancellation of any one or more outstanding awards and payment to the
holders of such awards that are vested as of such cancellation (including, without limitation, any awards that would vest as a result of the occurrence of such event but for such cancellation or for which vesting is accelerated by the Committee in
connection with such event) the value of such awards, if any, as determined by the Committee (which value, if applicable, may be based upon the price per ordinary share received or to be received by other holders of our ordinary shares in such
event), including, without limitation, in the case of stock options and stock appreciation rights, a cash payment equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the ordinary shares subject to the option or stock appreciation right over the
aggregate exercise price or strike price thereof, or, in the case of restricted stock, restricted stock units, or other equity-based awards that are not vested as of such cancellation, a cash payment or equity subject to deferred vesting and
delivery consistent with the vesting restrictions applicable to such award prior to cancellation of the underlying shares in respect thereof. 
Nontransferability of Awards. No award will be permitted to be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold, or otherwise
transferred or encumbered by a participant other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and any such purported assignment, alienation, pledge, attachment, sale, transfer, or encumbrance will be void and unenforceable against us or
any of our subsidiaries. However, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit awards (other than incentive stock options) to be transferred, including transfers to a participants family members, any trust established solely for the
benefit of a participant or such participants family members, any partnership or limited liability company of which a participant, or such participant and such participants family members, are the sole member(s), and a beneficiary to
whom donations are eligible to be treated as charitable contributions for tax purposes.  Amendment and
Termination. Our Board of Directors may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue, or terminate our Omnibus Incentive Plan or any portion thereof at any time; provided, that no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, or termination
may be made without shareholder approval if (i) such approval is necessary to comply with any regulatory requirement applicable to our Omnibus Incentive Plan or for changes in GAAP to new accounting standards; (ii) it would materially increase the
number of securities which may be issued under our Omnibus Incentive Plan (except for adjustments in connection with certain corporate events); or (iii) it would materially modify the requirements for participation in our Omnibus Incentive Plan;
provided, further, that any such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, or termination that would materially 
   160 




Table of Contents

 
and adversely affect the rights of any participant or any holder or beneficiary of any award will not to that extent be effective without such individuals consent. 
The Committee may, to the extent consistent with the terms of any applicable award agreement, waive any conditions or rights under, amend any
terms of, or alter, suspend, discontinue, cancel, or terminate, any award granted or the associated award agreement, prospectively or retroactively (including after a Termination); provided, that, except as otherwise permitted in our Omnibus
Incentive Plan, any such waiver, amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuance, cancellation, or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of any participant with respect to such award will not to that extent be effective
without such individuals consent; provided, further, that without shareholder approval, except as otherwise permitted in our Omnibus Incentive Plan, (i) no amendment or modification may reduce the exercise price of any option or the strike
price of any stock appreciation right; (ii) the Committee may not cancel any outstanding option or stock appreciation right and replace it with a new option or stock appreciation right (with a lower exercise price or strike price, as the case may
be) or other award or cash payment that is greater than the value of the cancelled option or stock appreciation right; and (iii) the Committee may not take any other action which is considered a repricing for purposes of the shareholder
approval rules of any securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which our securities are listed or quoted. 
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents. The Committee in its sole discretion may provide as part of an award dividends or dividend
equivalents, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; provided, that no dividends or dividend equivalents will be payable in respect of outstanding (i) options or stock appreciation rights, or (ii)
other unearned awards subject to performance conditions (other than or in addition to the passage of time) (although dividends or dividend equivalents may be accumulated in respect of unearned awards and paid within 15 days after such awards are
earned and become payable or distributable). Dividends, if any, that may have been withheld by the Committee and attributable to any particular share of restricted stock shall be distributed to the participant in cash or, in the sole discretion of
the Committee, in ordinary shares having a fair market value (on the date of distribution) equal to the amount of such dividends, upon the release of restrictions on such share and, if such share is forfeited, the participant shall have no right to
such dividends.   Clawback/Repayment. All awards are subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment to
the extent necessary to comply with (i) any clawback, forfeiture, or other similar policy adopted by our Board of Directors or the Committee and as in effect from time to time and (ii) applicable law. To the extent that a participant receives any
amount in excess of the amount that the participant should otherwise have received under the terms of the award for any reason (including, without limitation, by reason of a financial restatement, mistake in calculations. or other administrative
error), the participant will be required to repay us any such excess amount.  Detrimental Activity. If a participant has
engaged in any detrimental activity, as defined in our Omnibus Incentive Plan, as determined by the Committee, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for one or more of the following: (i) cancellation of any or all of such
participants outstanding awards; or (ii) forfeiture by the participant of any gain realized on the vesting or exercise of awards, and prompt repayment of any such gain to us.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
The agreements described in this section, or forms of such agreements as they will be in effect at the time of this offering, are filed as
exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and the following descriptions are qualified by reference thereto. 
Shareholders Agreement  In connection
with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions and this offering, we intend to enter into a new shareholders agreement with our Sponsor. The shareholders agreement will require us to nominate a number of individuals designated by our Sponsor for
election as our directors at any meeting of our shareholders (each a Sponsor Director) such that, following the election of any directors and taking into account any director continuing to serve as such without the need for re-election,
the number of Sponsor Directors serving as directors of our company will be equal to: (1) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 50% of our ordinary shares entitled to vote generally in the election
of directors as of the record date for such meeting, the lowest whole number that is greater than 50% of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors; (2) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates together continue to
beneficially own at least 40% (but less than 50%) of our ordinary shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as of the record date for such meeting, the lowest whole number that is at least 40% of the total number of directors
comprising our board of directors; (3) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 30% (but less than 40%) of our ordinary shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as of the record
date for such meeting, the lowest whole number that is at least 30% of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors; (4) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 20% (but less than
30%) of our ordinary shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as of the record date for such meeting, the lowest whole number that is at least 20% of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors; and (5) if
our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates together continue to beneficially own at least 5% (but less than 20%) of our ordinary shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors as of the record date for such meeting, the lowest whole
number that is at least 10% of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors. In the case of a vacancy on our board created by the removal or resignation of a Sponsor Director, the shareholders agreement will require us to nominate
an individual designated by our Sponsor for election to fill the vacancy. The above-described provisions of the shareholders agreement will remain in effect until our Sponsor is no longer entitled to nominate a Sponsor Director pursuant to the
shareholders agreement, unless our Sponsor requests that it terminate at an earlier date.   The shareholders agreement also provides
that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we renounce any interest or expectancy that we have in, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, specified business opportunities that may be presented from time to time to our Sponsor or
to members of our board of directors who are not our employees.   Registration Rights Agreement 
In connection with this offering, we intend to enter into a new registration rights agreement to provide to our Sponsor an unlimited number of
demand registration rights. The registration rights agreement will also provide our Sponsor customary piggyback registration rights. The registration rights agreement will also provide that we will pay certain expenses
relating to such registrations and indemnify our Sponsor against certain liabilities which may arise under the Securities Act.  Transaction and
Monitoring Fee and Support and Services Agreements  In connection with the Acquisition, Omaha Topco entered into a Transaction and
Monitoring Fee Agreement (the Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement) with Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C. (BMP) and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Advisors L.L.C., affiliates of the Sponsor (the

   162 




Table of Contents

 
Managers). Under the Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement, we paid the Managers, at the closing of the Acquisition, $56.8 million as a transaction fee as
consideration for the Managers undertaking due diligence investigations and financial and structural analysis and providing corporate strategy and other advice and negotiation assistance in connection with the Acquisition. In addition, Omaha Topco
and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively the Monitoring Service Recipients) reimburse the Managers for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Managers and their affiliates. 
In addition, under the Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement, the Monitoring Service Recipients have engaged the Managers to
provide certain monitoring, advisory and consulting services in the following areas:   


 

 
advice regarding financings and relationships with lenders and bankers;   


 

 
advice regarding the selection, retention and supervision of independent auditors, outside legal counsel, investment bankers and other advisors or consultants; 
 


 

 
advice regarding Environmental, Social and Governance issues pertinent to our affairs;   


 

 
advice regarding the strategic direction of our business; and   


 

 
such other advice directly related to or ancillary to the above advisory services as we may reasonably request. 
In consideration for the monitoring, advisory and consulting services, the Monitoring Service Recipients paid the Managers a monitoring fee at
the closing of the Acquisition and have paid, at the beginning of each subsequent fiscal year, a monitoring fee equal to 1% of a covenant EBITDA measure as defined in accordance with the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities. The
Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement also contemplates that Monitoring Service Recipients will pay to the Managers a milestone payment upon the consummation of an initial public offering. 
In connection with this offering, we and the Managers will terminate the Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement and we will enter
into a new Monitoring Fee Agreement (the New Monitoring Fee Agreement) with the Managers that will be substantially similar to the Existing Transaction and Monitoring Fee Agreement, except that the New Monitoring Fee Agreement will not
require the payment of a milestone payment in connection with an initial public offering and the New Monitoring Fee Agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the second anniversary of the closing date of this offering and (ii) the
date our Sponsor beneficially owns less than 5% of our ordinary shares and such shares have a fair market value of less than $25 million. Following termination, the Managers will refund us any portion of the monitoring fee previously paid in respect
of fiscal quarters that follow the termination date.  In addition, in connection with the Acquisition, Omaha Topco entered into a Support
and Services Agreement (the Existing Support and Services Agreement) with BMP. Under the Existing Support and Services Agreement, Omaha Topco and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries reimburse BMP and its affiliates for
expenses related to support services customarily provided by Blackstones portfolio operations group to Blackstones portfolio companies, as well as healthcare-related services provided by Blackstones Equity Healthcare group and
Blackstones group purchasing program. In connection with this offering, we and BMP will terminate the Existing Support and Services Agreement and we will enter into a new Support and Services Agreement with the Managers that will be
substantially similar to the Existing Support and Services Agreement, except that it will terminate on the date our Sponsor beneficially owns less than 5% of our ordinary shares and such shares have a fair market value of less than $25 million, or
such earlier date as may be chosen by Blackstone.  Pursuant to these agreements, we paid affiliates of our Sponsor $6.4 million, $6.1
million, $7.0 million and $3.1 million in the first nine months of 2017 (representing prepayment of estimated full year expenses and an adjustment related to the prior year), Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015 and Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014,
respectively.

of its common stock to John Plant, one of our directors, for an aggregate purchase price of $300,000.  On May 18, 2015, Omaha Topco

On March 10, 2017, Omaha Topco issued and sold 18,182 shares of its common stock to Roger Gaston, our Executive Vice PresidentHuman
Resources, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,001.   Commercial Transactions with Sponsor Portfolio Companies 
Our Sponsor and its affiliates have ownership interests in a broad range of companies. We have entered and may in the future enter into
commercial transactions in the ordinary course of our business with some of these companies, including the sale of goods and services and the purchase of goods and services. 
During August 2014, Blackstone acquired an interest in Alliance Automotive Group (Alliance), a wholesale distributor of automotive
parts in France and the United Kingdom. Subsequent to this transaction, we had sales of $4.2 million to affiliates of Alliance during Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014. Our sales to affiliates of Alliance during Fiscal 2015, Fiscal 2016 and the
first nine months of 2017 were $11.1 million, $20.0 million and $23.4 million, respectively.  Blackstone also holds an interest in Optiv
Inc., an entity that supplies us with certain IT-related services. During Post-Acquisition Predecessor 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we paid Optiv Inc. $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. 
Indemnification Agreements  We plan to
enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers to indemnify them to the maximum extent allowed under applicable law. These agreements indemnify these individuals against certain costs, charges, losses, liabilities,
damages and expenses incurred by such director or officer in the execution or discharge of his or her duties or the exercise of his or her powers or otherwise in relation to or in connection with his or her duties, powers or office. These agreements
do not indemnify our directors against any liability attaching to such individuals in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company of which he or she is a director, which would be rendered
void under the Companies Act 2006.  There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors,
officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.

  Depositary Receipt Arrangements 
In connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions described under SummaryOur Organizational Structure, our Sponsor
and the other equity owners of Omaha Topco will receive depositary receipts, each representing one ordinary share in Gates Industrial Corporation plc in consideration for their equity in Omaha Topco, at a ratio of 0.76293 of our ordinary shares for
each outstanding share of Omaha Topco. The depositary receipts will be issued by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as depositary (the Depositary), and a nominee for the Depositary (the Depositary Nominee) will be the
registered holder of the ordinary shares of Gates Industrial Corporation plc issued in exchange for the outstanding shares of Omaha Topco. 
The depositary receipts arrangement is being established because, as a result of restrictions on transfer on certain of the ordinary shares
concerned, those ordinary shares cannot be issued directly into DTC at the time of this offering. The use of the Depositary allows for the shares to be held in the Depositary initially and subsequently transferred into DTC without the application of
U.K. stamp duty or SDRT, provided certain conditions are met. See TaxationMaterial U.K. Tax ConsiderationsStamp Duty and SDRTDepositary arrangements and clearance services for more information. The depositary receipts
will not be registered or listed on the NYSE or any other stock exchange, will not be eligible for DTC, and no trading market for them is expected to develop. Instead, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and contractual
restrictions on transfer, the pre-IPO owners may request of the Depositary that all or a portion of their depositary receipts be cancelled in order to effectuate a transfer of the ordinary shares underlying such depositary receipts to Cede &
Co., as nominee/custodian for DTC, which will hold the transferred ordinary shares on its customary terms, in order to settle trades of such ordinary shares (in the public market or otherwise), or to otherwise hold or transfer such shares through
and within the systems of DTC.  Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and contractual restrictions on transfer, the
holders of the depositary receipts will generally be entitled to the same rights as a direct holder of our ordinary shares or an investor holding book-entry interests in our ordinary shares through DTC. 
A holder of depositary receipts will be entitled to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying its depositary receipts from the Depositary upon
the surrender of such depositary receipts to the Depositary and the delivery of applicable transfer documentation. See TaxationMaterial U.K. Tax ConsiderationsStamp Duty and SDRT, in relation to the stamp duty and SDRT
consequences.   Statement of Policy Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
Prior to the completion of this offering, our board of directors will adopt a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related
persons, which we refer to as our related person policy. Our related person policy requires that a related person (as defined in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose to our
general counsel any related person transaction (defined as any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved
exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. Our general counsel will then promptly communicate that information to our board of directors. No
related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our board of directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will
recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest.

Table of Contents

 PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares as of December 31, 2017 after giving
effect to the pre-IPO reorganization transactions by (1) each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares, (2) each of our directors and named executive officers and (3) all of our directors
and executive officers as a group.   The amounts and percentages of ordinary shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of
SEC regulations governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a beneficial owner of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which includes
the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Securities that can be so
acquired are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing such persons ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other persons percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial
owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. 
Except as otherwise indicated in the footnotes below, each of the beneficial owners has, to our knowledge, sole voting and investment power
with respect to the indicated ordinary shares. Unless otherwise noted, the address of each beneficial owner is 1551 Wewatta Street, Denver, Colorado 80202

 DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS 
The following section summarizes the terms of our material principal indebtedness. 
Senior Secured Credit Facilities  On
July 3, 2014 (the Acquisition Closing Date), we entered into senior secured credit facilities with Credit Suisse AG (acting through such of its affiliates or branches as it deems appropriate), as administrative agent, collateral
agent, L/C issuer and swing line lender (the senior secured credit facilities). On April 7, 2017 and November 22, 2017, we amended the senior secured credit facilities. 
The senior secured credit facilities consist of the following:   


 

 
$1,733.7 million of senior secured Dollar Term Loans, the maturity date of which is March 31, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date to be three months prior to the maturity date of the notes to the extent
that more than a specified amount of dollar notes are outstanding on such earlier date;   


 

 
655.2 million ($771.0 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) senior secured Euro Term Loans (together with the Dollar Term Loans, the Term Loans), the maturity date of which
is March 31, 2024, subject to a springing maturity date to be three months prior to the maturity date of the notes to the extent that more than a specified amount of dollar notes are outstanding on such earlier date; 
 


 

 
the $125 million Revolving Credit Facility, the maturity date of which is (x) July 2022 with respect to $101.9 million thereof, subject to a springing maturity date to be three months prior to the maturity
date of the notes to the extent that more than a specified amount of dollar notes are outstanding on such earlier date and (y) July 2019 with respect to $23.1 million thereof; and 
 


 

 
the ABL Revolving Credit Facility described under ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 
Gates Global LLC, which is referred to in this section as the Borrower, is the borrower under the senior secured credit
facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility includes borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as the swing line borrowings. In addition, the senior secured credit facilities provide us with the
option to raise incremental credit facilities (including an uncommitted incremental facility that allows us the option to increase the amount available under the term loan facilities and/or the revolving credit facility by an aggregate of up to
$590 million, subject to additional increases upon satisfaction of certain first lien net leverage-based tests), refinance the loans with debt incurred outside the credit agreement and extend the maturity date of the revolving loans and term
loans, subject to certain limitations.   As part of certain refinancing transactions we are pursuing in January 2018, prior to the
closing of this offering, we intend to receive additional commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility to increase the commitments to an amount expected to be approximately $185 million and extend the maturity date for the entire Revolving Credit
Facility from July 3, 2022 to January 2023, with a springing maturity of April 15, 2022 if more than $500 million of the dollar notes remain outstanding at that time. 
Interest Rate and Fees 
Borrowings under the Term Loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to a margin over either (a) a base rate determined by
reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agents prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% (0% in the case of Euro Term
Loans only) or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the ICE Benchmark Administration London Interbank Offered Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, or in the case of Euro Term Loans, a EURIBO rate determined by
reference to the Banking Federation of the E.U. for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. The current margins for the Dollar Term Loans are (x) 2.00% in the case of base rate loans and 3.00% in the case of LIBOR loans, in each case
subject to a step-down of 0.25% following a qualifying initial public offering. The current margin for the Euro Term Loans is 3.25%, subject to a step-down of 0.25% following a qualifying initial public offering.

 Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal
to a margin over either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agents prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the LIBOR rate for a one-month
interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the ICE Benchmark Administration London Interbank Offered Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing or a EURIBO rate determined by reference to the Banking
Federation of the E.U. for the interest period relevant to such borrowing. The current margins for the Revolving Credit Facility are 1.75% in the case of base rate loans and 2.75% in the case of LIBOR loans, subject to step-downs upon the
achievement of specified first lien net leverage ratios.  In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured
credit facilities, we will continue to be required to pay a facility fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The facility fee rate is 0.50%, subject to a step-down to 0.375% upon
the achievement of a specified first lien net leverage ratio. We will also continue to be required to pay customary letter of credit fees. 
Prepayments  The
senior secured credit facilities require us to prepay outstanding Term Loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:   


 

 
50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0%, as applicable, subject to our attaining certain first lien net leverage ratios) of our annual excess cash flow; 
 


 

 
100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property by the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries (including insurance and condemnation proceeds, subject to de
minimis thresholds), if we do not reinvest those net cash proceeds in assets to be used in our business or to make certain other permitted investments (a) within 12 months of the receipt of such net cash proceeds or (b) if we commit to
reinvest such net cash proceeds within 12 months of the receipt thereof, within 18 months of such initial receipt (although in connection with any such prepayment, we may also repay other first lien debt to the extent we are so required); and
  


 

 
100% of the net proceeds of any incurrence of debt by the Borrower or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the senior secured credit facilities. 
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each lender of Term Loans will have the right to reject its pro rata share of mandatory prepayments
described above, in which case we may retain the amounts so rejected.  The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied pro rata to
installments of Term Loans.  We will continue to have the ability to voluntarily repay outstanding loans at any time (subject to minimum
repayment amounts and customary notice periods) without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. 
Amortization  We
will be required to repay installments on the Dollar Term Loans in quarterly installments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount of the Dollar Term Loans and repay installments on the Euro Term Loans in quarterly installments equal to 0.25%
of the original principal amount of the Euro Term Loans, with the remaining amount payable on the applicable maturity date with respect to such Term Loans. 
Guarantees  The
obligations under the senior secured credit facilities will continue to be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by each of the co-issuer of the notes offered hereby, any entity that directly or indirectly owns 100%

of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Borrower, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Borrowers existing and future material domestic wholly owned subsidiaries
(collectively, the U.S. Guarantors). In addition, the senior secured credit facilities will continue to be collateralized by (i) first priority or equivalent security interests in (x) all the capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, the Borrower and each of the Borrowers and U.S. Guarantors material direct or indirect wholly owned restricted domestic subsidiaries and direct wholly owned first-tier restricted foreign subsidiaries and (y) certain
tangible and intangible assets of the Borrower and those of the U.S. Guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications) not constituting ABL Priority Collateral (as defined below) (collectively the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Collateral) and (ii) a second priority or equivalent security interests in the ABL Priority Collateral (other than ABL Priority Collateral pledged by the Canadian Guarantors (as defined below)). 
As of September 30, 2017, none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non-wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries
guarantee the senior secured credit facilities.  Certain Covenants and Events of Default 
The senior secured credit facilities will continue to contain a number of significant negative covenants. Such negative covenants, among other
things, will restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to:   


 

 
incur additional indebtedness and make guarantees;   


 

 
create liens on assets;   


 

 
enter into sale and leaseback transactions;   


 

 
engage in mergers or consolidations;   


 

 
sell assets;   


 

 
make fundamental changes;   


 

 
pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;   


 

 
make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions;   


 

 
engage in certain transactions with affiliates;   


 

 
make changes in the nature of their business; and   


 

 
make prepayments of junior debt.  The Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries are also
subject to a springing maximum first lien net leverage ratio not exceeding 7.15 to 1.00 if borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 30% of the issued and outstanding loans and commitments as of the last day of any fiscal quarter
(excluding up to $35.0 million of letters of credit and other letters of credit which have been cash collateralized or backstopped by other letters of credit). 
Our senior secured credit facilities also continue to contain certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and
events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the senior secured credit facilities and all actions
permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.  ABL Revolving Credit Facility 
On the Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into an asset based credit facility with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent,
L/C issuer and swing line lender (the ABL Revolving Credit Facility). On April 7, 2017, we amended (the ABL Amendment) the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 
   170 




Table of Contents

 The ABL Revolving Credit Facility is in an aggregate principal amount of $325 million, the
maturity date of which is (x) July 2022 with respect to $295 million thereof, subject to a springing maturity date to be three months prior to the maturity date of the notes to the extent that more than a specified amount of dollar notes are
outstanding on such earlier date (the 2022 Commitments) and (y) July 2019 with respect to $30 million thereof (the 2019 Commitments). 
As part of certain refinancing transactions we are pursuing in January 2018, prior to the closing of this offering, we intend to extend the
maturity date for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility from July 3, 2022 to January 2023, with a springing maturity of April 15, 2022 if more than $500 million of the dollar notes remain outstanding at that time. 
The borrowing base at any time will be equal to the sum (in each case subject to certain customary reserves and eligibility criteria) of: 
 


 

 
85% of all of the U.S. eligible receivables and 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of all of the U.S. eligible inventory (the U.S. Borrowing Base); and 
 


 

 
85% of all of the Canadian eligible receivables and 85% of the net orderly liquidation value of all of the Canadian eligible inventory (the Canadian Borrowing Base). 
Gates Global LLC, which is referred to in this section as the Borrower, is the parent borrower under the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility will continue to include borrowing capacity available for letters of credit and for short-term borrowings referred to as the swing line borrowings. In addition, we expect that the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility will also continue to provide us with the option to raise incremental credit facilities (including an uncommitted incremental facility that allows us the option to increase the amount available under the ABL Facility by an aggregate of up
to $150 million).  Interest Rate and Fees 
Borrowings under the new ABL Revolving Credit Facility will continue to bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to a margin over
(i) in respect of the U.S. tranche, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the administrative agents prime lending rate, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (3) the
LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBOR rate determined by reference to the ICE Benchmark Administration London Interbank Offered Rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing and (ii) in respect of
the Canadian tranche, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the Canadian prime lending rate and (2) the CDOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a CDOR rate determined for the
interest period relevant to such borrowing. The margins for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility with respect to 2019 Commitments and loans thereunder are (x) 1.00% in the case of base rate loans and 2.00% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate
loans when excess availability under the ABL revolving facility is less than 33.3%, (y) 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and 1.75% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate loans when excess availability under the ABL revolving facility is
less than 66.7% but greater than or equal to 33.3% or (z) 0.50% in the case of base rate loans and 1.50% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate loans when excess availability under the ABL revolving facility is greater than or equal to 66.7%.
The margins for the ABL Revolving Credit Facility with respect to 2022 Commitments and loans thereunder are (x) 0.75% in the case of base rate loans and 1.75% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate loans when excess availability under the ABL
revolving facility is less than 33.3%, (y) 0.50% in the case of base rate loans and 1.50% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate loans when excess availability under the ABL revolving facility is less than 66.7% but greater than or equal to
33.3%, or (z) 0.25% in the case of base rate loans and 1.25% in the case of LIBOR rate or CDOR rate loans when excess availability under the ABL revolving facility is greater than or equal to 66.7% 
In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we will continue to be required to pay a
commitment fee to the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility in 
   171 




Table of Contents

 
respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee rate is 0.375%, subject to a step-down to 0.25% based on the utilization of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility commitments. We
will also continue to be required to pay customary letter of credit fees.  Prepayments 
If at any time the outstanding revolving loans and letters of credit pursuant to any tranche of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility exceed the
lesser of (i) the aggregate commitments with respect to such tranche under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) the current U.S. Borrowing Base or Canadian Borrowing Base, as applicable, we will be required to prepay applicable
revolving loans of the applicable tranche (and/or cash collateralize the letters of credit) in an amount equal to such excess, without commitment reduction. 
After the occurrence and during the continuance of a cash dominion event (the period when (i) excess availability is less than the
greater of (x) $20 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (1) the aggregate commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and (2) the aggregate borrowing base for a period of five consecutive business days,
(ii) when any payment or bankruptcy event of default is continuing or (iii) when any event of default due to a material misrepresentation set forth in borrowing base certificate, breach of the financial covenant, a cross-default or
cross-acceleration, failure to comply with cash management provisions or a failure to deliver any borrowing base certificate (after expiration of any applicable cure periods) is continuing, until the 30th consecutive calendar day that excess
availability exceeds such threshold or such event of default ceases to be continuing, as applicable), all amounts deposited in the controlled deposit accounts will be swept into core concentration accounts maintained with the administrative agent
and will be promptly applied to repay outstanding revolving loans and, after such loans have been repaid in full, cash collateralize any outstanding letter of credit obligations. 
We may voluntarily reduce the unutilized portion of the commitment amount and repay outstanding loans at any time (subject to minimum
repayment amounts and customary notice periods) without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs, if applicable, with respect to LIBOR or CDOR loans. 
Amortization 
There will be no scheduled amortization under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 
Guarantees  The
obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility will continue to be unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by each of the U.S. Guarantors and, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Borrowers existing and future material Canadian
material wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, the Canadian Guarantors; together with the U.S. Guarantors, the Guarantors). In addition, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility will continue to be collateralized by
(i) first priority or equivalent security interests in personal property of the Borrower and the Guarantors consisting of accounts receivable (including related contracts and contract rights, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, other bank
accounts and securities accounts), inventory, intercompany notes and intangible assets (other than capital stock and intellectual property), instruments, chattel paper, documents and commercial tort claims to the extent arising out of the foregoing,
books and records (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications) (collectively the ABL Priority Collateral) and (ii) a second priority or equivalent security interests in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities Collateral. 
As of September 30, 2017, none of our foreign subsidiaries (other than the Canadian Guarantors) or our non-wholly owned domestic subsidiaries
that are restricted subsidiaries guarantee the ABL Revolving Credit Facility.

make prepayments of junior debt.  The Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries will also be
required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of any fiscal quarter if excess availability is less than the greater of (x) $20 million and (y) 10% of the lesser of (1) the aggregate
commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and (2) the aggregate borrowing base until the 30th consecutive calendar day that excess availability exceeds such threshold. 
The ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If
an event of default occurs, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a
secured creditor.  Senior Notes  On
June 26, 2014, the notes issuers issued $1,040.0 million principal amount of dollar notes and 235.0 million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) principal amount of euro notes. On March 30, 2017, the notes
issuers issued an additional $150.0 million principal amount of dollar notes at an issue price of 99.875%.  The dollar notes bear interest
at a rate of 6.00% per year and the euro notes bear interest at a rate of 5.75% per year, each payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The notes issuers obligations under the senior notes are guaranteed
on a senior unsecured basis by all of the notes issuers existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our senior secured credit facilities or certain other indebtedness of the issuers or the guarantors. 
The dollar notes are currently redeemable at a price of 103.000%, which redemption price will decrease to 101.500% on July 15, 2018 and
100.000% on July 15, 2019, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The euro notes are currently redeemable at a price of 102.875%, which redemption price will decrease to 101.438% on July 15, 2018 and 100.000% on
July 15, 2019, in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  Upon the occurrence of a change of control or upon the sale of
certain assets in which the note issuers do not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the senior notes will have the right to require the notes issuers to

make an offer to repurchase each holders senior notes at a price equal to 101% (in the case of a change of control) or 100% (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, in each
case plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon.  The senior notes contain covenants limiting, among other things, the notes issuers
and the restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares, pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions, make certain investments, sell or transfer certain assets, create liens,
consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of notes issuers assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. The senior notes also contain
customary events of default.

unconditionally) to allot shares in the Issuer and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Issuer up to an aggregate nominal amount of $30,000,000, which would equal 3.0 billion ordinary shares based on the
$0.01 par value per share, and to exclude pre-emptive rights in respect of such allotments. Such authority will be granted for five years, but we may seek renewal for additional five-year terms more frequently. 
Key Provisions of the Issuers Articles of Association and English Law considerations

Directors General Authority and Shareholders Reserve Power 
Subject to the Companies Act 2006 (the Companies Act) and the Articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the
Issuers business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the Issuer. The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, a specified action or actions. No such special resolution
and no alteration of the Articles invalidates anything which the directors have done before the resolution is passed or the Articles are altered (as appropriate).

 Directors Interests 
A director shall be authorized for the purposes of section 175 of the Companies Act to act or continue to act as a director of the Issuer
notwithstanding that at the time of the appointment or subsequently the director also:   


 
(a)
holds office as a director of any subsidiary of the Issuer;   


 
(b)
holds any other office, employment or engagement with any subsidiary of the Issuer;   


 
(c)
participates in any scheme, transaction or arrangement for the benefit of the employees or former employees of the Issuer or any subsidiary of the Issuer (including any pension fund or retirement, death or disability
scheme or other bonus or employee benefit scheme); or   


 
(d)
is interested directly or indirectly in any shares or debentures (or any rights to acquire shares or debentures) in the Issuer or in any subsidiary of the Issuer. 
The directors may authorize any matter proposed to them which would, if not so authorized, involve a breach of duty by a director under
section 175 of the Companies Act. The directors may give any such authorization upon such terms as they think fit. The directors may vary or terminate any such authorization at any time. Any such authorization will be effective only if: 
 


 
(a)
any requirement as to the quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the director in question or any other director interested in the matter under consideration; and
  


 
(b)
the matter was agreed to without such directors voting or would have been agreed to if such directors votes had not been counted. 
A director who is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a proposed transaction or arrangement with the Issuer must declare the
nature and extent of his or her interest to the other directors before the Issuer enters into the transaction or arrangement. A director who is in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in a transaction or arrangement that has been entered into
by the Issuer must declare the nature and extent of his or her interest to the other directors as soon as is reasonably practicable, unless the interest has already been declared. If a declaration proves to be, or becomes, inaccurate or incomplete,
a further declaration must be made.  A director need not declare an interest: 
 


 
(a)
if it cannot reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest;   


 
(b)
if, or to the extent that, the other directors are already aware of it (and for this purpose the other directors are treated as aware of anything of which they ought reasonably to be aware); 
 


 
(c)
if, or to the extent that, it concerns terms of his or her service contract that have been or are to be considered by a board meeting or by a committee of the board appointed for the purpose; or 
 


 
(d)
if the director is not aware of his interest or is not aware of the transaction or arrangement in question (and for this purpose a director is treated as being aware of matters of which he ought reasonably to be aware).
 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, and provided that either (i) he or she has declared the nature and
extent of any direct or indirect interest of his or hers, or (ii) no declaration of interest is required, or (iii) the direct or indirect interest relates to the Issuer or a subsidiary of the Issuer, a director notwithstanding his office:
  


 
(a)
may be a party to, or otherwise be interested in, any transaction or arrangement with the Issuer or in which the Issuer is directly or indirectly interested; 
 


 
(b)
may act by himself or herself or through his or her firm in a professional capacity for the Issuer (otherwise than as auditor), and in any such case on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise as the directors may
decide; and 
   176 




Table of Contents




 
(c)
may be a director or other officer of, or employed or engaged by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise be interested in, any body corporate in which the Issuer is directly or indirectly
interested.  Voting by Directors 
Subject to the Companies Act and without prejudice to the obligation of a director to disclose his or her interest, a director may vote at any
board meeting or meeting of a committee of directors on any resolution concerning a matter in relation to which he has, directly or indirectly, an interest or duty, subject always to the terms on which any authorization is given. Subject to the
foregoing, the relevant director shall be counted in the quorum present at a meeting when any such resolution is under consideration and if such director votes his or her vote shall be counted. 
Subject to the paragraph below, if a question arises at a board meeting or meeting of a committee of directors as to the right of any director
to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes, the question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be referred to the chairman whose ruling in relation to any director other than the chairman is to be final
and conclusive.  If any question as to the right to participate in the meeting (or part of the meeting) should arise in respect of the
chairman, the question is to be decided by a decision of the directors at that meeting, for which purpose the chairman is not to be counted as participating in the meeting (or part of the meeting) for voting or quorum purposes. 
Subject to the Articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to
be recorded or communicated to directors.  Appointment and Removal of Directors 
Any person who is willing to act as a director of the Issuer, and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a director by ordinary
resolution in a general meeting. The holder or holders of more than 50% of the ordinary shares of the Issuer for the time being in issue may in accordance with the Articles remove a director from office. 
Unless and until otherwise decided by the Issuer by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, the number of directors must not be less than
two and is not subject to a maximum number.  Blackstone shall have the right, but not the obligation, to designate a number of individuals
as directors such that, following the election of any directors and taking into account any director continuing to serve as such without the need for re-election, the number of directors designated by Blackstone shall be equal to: (i) if our pre-IPO
owners and their affiliates collectively beneficially own 50% or more of the ordinary shares, the lowest whole number that is greater than 50% of the total number of directors; (ii) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates collectively
beneficially own at least 40% (but less than 50%) of the ordinary shares, the lowest whole number that is greater than 40% of the total number of directors comprising our board of directors; (iii) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates
collectively beneficially own at least 30% (but less than 40%) of the ordinary shares, the lowest whole number that is greater than 30% of the total number of directors; (iv) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates collectively beneficially own
at least 20% (but less than 30%) of the ordinary shares, the lowest whole number that is greater than 20% of the total number of directors; and (v) if our pre-IPO owners and their affiliates collectively beneficially own at least 5% (but less than
20%) of the ordinary shares, the lowest whole number (such number always being greater than or equal to one) that is greater than 10% of the total number of directors. 
Retirement of Directors 
Under the Companies Act, there is no maximum age for directors.

 Dividend Rights 
Subject to the Companies Act, the Issuer may by ordinary resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting declare dividends, and the board
of directors may decide to pay interim dividends. A dividend must not be declared unless the board has made a recommendation as to its amount. Such a dividend must not exceed the amount recommended by the board. No dividend may be declared or paid
unless it is in accordance with shareholders respective rights and interests. Unless the shareholders ordinary resolution to declare or the boards decision to pay a dividend, or the terms on which shares are issued, specify
otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholders holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it. If the Issuers share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be
paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrears. Subject to the Companies Act, the board of directors may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it
appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the payment. If the directors act in good faith, they do not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful
payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights. The board of directors may deduct from any dividend payable on or in respect of a share all sums of money presently payable by the shareholder to the Issuer on any
account whatsoever. Subject to the terms of issue of the share in question, the Issuer may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting on the recommendation of the board of directors, decide to pay all or part of a dividend or other distribution
payable in respect of a share by transferring non-cash assets of equivalent value (including, without limitation, shares or other securities in any company). 
If 12 years have passed from the date on which a dividend or other sum became due for payment and the distribution recipient has not claimed
it, the distribution recipient is no longer entitled to that dividend or other sum and it ceases to remain owing by the Issuer unless the board decides otherwise. 
Winding Up  If the
Issuer is wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a special resolution in a general meeting of the Issuer and any other sanction required by the Companies Act, divide among the shareholders in specie the whole or any part of the assets of
the Issuer and may, for that purpose, value any assets and determine how the division shall be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. The liquidator may, with the like sanction, vest the whole or any part of
the assets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of shareholders as he or she with the like sanction determines, but no shareholder shall be compelled to accept any assets upon which there is a liability. 
Redemption 
Subject to the Companies Act, the Issuer may issue shares which are to be redeemed, or are liable to be redeemed at the option of the Issuer or
the holder, and the directors may determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of any such shares. The issued ordinary shares of the Issuer are neither convertible nor redeemable. 
Repurchase of Shares 
Subject to the Companies Act, the Issuer may purchase any of its own shares (including redemption of shares, if any are in issue) with the
authority of an ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting. The authority may be general or limited to a specific class of shares authorized to be required, the maximum and minimum prices that may be paid for the shares and the date of expiry
of the authority (which must not be longer than five years after the resolution is passed). The authorization may be varied or revoked by ordinary resolution. 
Sinking Fund Provisions 
There are no sinking fund provisions relating to any shares in the capital of the Issuer.

Table of Contents

 Variation of Rights 
Subject to the Companies Act, the rights attached to a class of shares may be varied or abrogated (whether or not the Issuer is being wound up)
either with the consent in writing of the holders of at least three-quarters of the nominal amount of the issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at
a separate general meeting of the holders of the issued shares of that class validly held in accordance with the Articles.  The rights
attached to a class of shares are not, unless otherwise expressly provided for in the rights attaching to those shares, deemed to be varied by the creation, allotment or issue of further shares ranking in priority to, pari passu with or subsequent
to them or by the purchase or redemption by the Issuer of its own shares in accordance with the Companies Act.  Allotment of Shares
and Pre-Emption   Under section 551 of the Companies Act, the board of directors of the Issuer may not allot shares, or grant
rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares, unless they are authorized to do so under the Articles or by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders. The authorization must state the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted
under it, and specify the date on which it will expire, which must be not more than five years from the date on which the resolution is passed by virtue of which the authorization is given. Prior to the completion of this offering, an ordinary
resolution will be adopted by our shareholders to authorize our board of directors (generally and unconditionally) to allot shares in the Issuer and to grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Issuer up to an
aggregate nominal amount of $30,000,000, which would equal 3.0 billion ordinary shares based on the $0.01 par value per share. Such authority will be granted for five years, but we may seek renewal for additional five-year terms more
frequently.   Under section 561 of the Companies Act, the board of directors of the Issuer must not allot shares to a person unless:
(a) it has made an offer to each person who holds ordinary shares (on the same or more favorable terms) to allot a proportion of the shares being offered that is as nearly as practicable equal to the proportion in nominal value of the ordinary
share capital held by that person; and (b) the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the Issuer has received notice of the acceptance or refusal of every offer so made. The offer shall be made by notice stating the
period (of not less than 14 days) during which it may be accepted and the offer shall not be withdrawn before the end of that period. Under sections 570 and 571 of the Companies Act, the board of directors of the Issuer may be given power by a
special resolution of the shareholders to allot shares as if section 561 of the Companies Act did not apply to the allotment (or applied to the allotment with such modifications as the directors may determine). 
Prior to the completion of this offering, an ordinary resolution will be adopted by our shareholders in a general meeting to exclude
pre-emptive rights in respect of the allotment of shares described in the first paragraph of this section (Allotment of Shares and Pre-Emption). Such authority will be granted for five years, but we may seek renewal for additional
five-year terms more frequently.  Transfers of Shares 
The board of directors may decline to register any transfer of shares in certificated form unless: 
 


 
(a)
the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share;   


 
(b)
the instrument of transfer is lodged at the place where the Issuers register of shareholders is situated from time to time accompanied by the relevant share certificate(s) or such other evidence as the board of
directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer or, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on the transferors behalf, the authority of that person to do so; 
   179 




Table of Contents




 
(c)
it is fully paid;   


 
(d)
it is for a share upon which the Issuer has no lien; and   


 
(e)
it is duly stamped or duly certificated or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the board of directors to be exempt from stamp duty (if so required). 
The board of directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares (whether fully paid or not) in favor of more than four
persons jointly.  The board of directors may refuse to register a transfer of a share in uncertificated form to a person who is to hold it
thereafter in certificated form in any case where the Issuer is entitled to refuse (or is excepted from the requirement) under the Uncertificated Securities Regulations or other applicable regulations to register the transfer. 
Any holder of depositary receipts representing underlying ordinary shares or holder of book-entry interests in our ordinary shares will not be
the holder of record of such shares. Instead, the depository (e.g., Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, in the case of ordinary shares issued in this offering; or the Depositary Nominee, as nominee for Computershare Trust Company, N.A., in the case
of the ordinary shares underlying the depositary receipts issued to our pre-IPO owners in connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions) or other nominee will be the holder of record of such shares. Accordingly, a transfer from a person
holding depositary receipts representing underlying ordinary shares or book-entry interests in our ordinary shares to a person who will become the holder of those depositary receipts representing such shares or book-entry interests in such shares
through the same depository or other nominee will not be registered in the Issuers register of shareholders, as the depository or other nominee will remain the holder of record of such shares. 
Share Certificates 
The Issuer shall issue a share certificate to every person whose name is entered in the register of shareholders of the Issuer in respect of
shares in certificated form, except where the Companies Act allows the Issuer not to issue a certificate.  No right to inspect
accounts and other records  No person is entitled to inspect any of the Issuers accounting or other records or documents
merely by virtue of being a shareholder, except as provided by law or authorized by the board of directors or by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting. 
Limitations on the rights to own securities 
Under the laws of England and Wales, persons who are neither residents nor nationals of the U.K. may freely own, hold or exercise voting rights
of securities of the Issuer in the same manner and under the same terms as U.K. residents or nationals.  General Meetings
 Under the Companies Act, every public company must hold a general meeting as its annual general meeting in each period of six
months beginning with the day following the end of its fiscal year. The directors may convene a general meeting whenever they think fit. Following a request by shareholders pursuant to the Companies Act, the board of directors are required to call a
general meeting (a) within 21 days from the date on which the directors become subject to the requirement, and (b) to be held on a date not more than 28 days after the date of the notice convening the meeting. At a meeting convened on a
requisition by shareholders, no business may be transacted except that stated by the requisition or proposed to the board of directors. An annual general meeting (other than adjourned annual general meetings) shall be called by at least 21 clear
days written 
   180 




Table of Contents

 
notice. All other general meetings (other than adjourned general meetings) shall be called by at least 14 clear days written notice. An annual general meeting may be called by shorter
notice if it is so agreed unanimously by all shareholders having a right to attend and vote. A general meeting (other than an annual general meeting) may be called by shorter notice if it is so agreed by a majority in number of the shareholders
having a right to attend and vote, being a majority together holding not less than 95% in nominal value of the shares giving that right. 
The notice shall specify the date, time and place of the meeting and the general nature of the business to be transacted. If the meeting is
convened to consider a special resolution, the text of the resolution and the intention to propose the resolution as a special resolution shall also be specified. The notice of the meeting shall also specify, with reasonable prominence, the
shareholders rights to appoint one or more proxies under section 324 of the Companies Act. Subject to the Articles and to any restrictions imposed on any shares, the notice shall be given to all shareholders, to all persons entitled to a share
in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a shareholder (if the Issuer has been notified of their entitlement) and to the directors and auditors of the Issuer. Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall be bound by any notice in respect
of that share which, before his name is entered in the register, has duly been given to the person from whom he derives his title. The accidental omission to give notice of a general meeting or to send, supply or make available any document or
information relating to a meeting to, or the non receipt of any such notice, document or information by, a person entitled to receive any such notice, document or information shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting. 
A person is able to exercise the right to speak at a general meeting when that person is in a position to communicate to all those attending
the meeting, during the meeting, any information or opinions which that person has on the business of the meeting. A person is able to exercise the right to vote at a general meeting when: 
 


 
(a)
that person is able to vote, during the meeting, on resolutions put to the vote at the meeting; and   


 
(b)
that persons vote can be taken into account in determining whether or not such resolutions are passed at the same time as the votes of all the other persons attending the meeting. 
The board of directors may make whatever arrangements they consider appropriate to enable those attending a general meeting to exercise their
rights to speak or vote at it. In determining attendance at a general meeting, it is immaterial whether any two or more shareholders attending it are in the same place as each other. Two or more persons who are not in the same place as each other
attend a general meeting if their circumstances are such that if they have (or were to have) rights to speak and vote at that meeting, they are (or would be) able to exercise them. 
Voting Rights  A
resolution put to the vote of a general meeting must be decided on a show of hands unless (before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands) a poll is demanded in accordance with the Articles. For so long as any shares are held in a
settlement system operated by DTC, any resolution put to the vote at a general meeting must be decided on a poll. Subject to any rights or restrictions attached to any shares, whether or not such rights or restrictions are set out in the Articles,
on a vote on a resolution at a general meeting every shareholder present in person or by proxy has on a show of hands one vote and every shareholder present in person or by proxy has on a poll one vote in respect of each share held. In the case of
joint holders of a share, only the vote of the first-named holder who votes (and any proxy or corporate representative duly authorized by the relevant shareholder) may be counted. In the case of equality of votes on a show of hands or a poll, the
chairman of the meeting shall not be entitled to a casting vote.   No business other than the appointment of the chairman of the
meeting is to be transacted at a general meeting if the persons attending it do not constitute a quorum. A quorum shall be present if shareholders who together represent at least the majority of the voting rights of all the shareholders entitled to
vote at the relevant meeting are present in person or by proxy.

 U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers 
At this time, we do not expect the Takeover Code to apply to us. The Takeover Panel has confirmed to our representatives that, on the basis of
our planned board of directors, it does not consider the Takeover Code to apply to the Issuer, although that position is subject to change if our place of central management and control is subsequently found to move to the U.K. If, at the time of a
takeover, after the Takeover Panel determines that we have our place of central management and control in the U.K., we could be subject to the Takeover Code, which is issued and administered by the Takeover Panel. The Takeover Code provides a
framework within which takeovers of companies subject to it are conducted. In particular, the Takeover Code contains certain rules in respect of mandatory offers. Under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code, if a person: 
 


 
(a)
acquires an interest in our shares that, when taken together with shares in which persons acting in concert with such person are interested, carries 30% or more of the voting rights of our shares; or 
 


 
(b)
who, together with persons acting in concert with such person, is interested in shares that in the aggregate carry not less than 30% and not more than 50% of the voting rights in the Issuer, acquires additional
interests in shares that increase the percentage of shares carrying voting rights in which that person is interested,  the acquirer, and,
depending on the circumstances, its concert parties, would be required (except with the consent of the Takeover Panel) to make a cash offer for our outstanding shares at a price not less than the highest price paid for any interests in the shares by
the acquirer or its concert parties during the previous 12 months. As noted above, at this time, we do not expect the Takeover Code to apply on the basis that our management and control is outside the U.K. However, the analysis of whether the
Takeover Code applies is fact-specific and therefore subject to change.  Disclosure of Shareholder Ownership 
There is no provision in the Articles governing the ownership threshold above which shareholder ownership must be disclosed. 
Under section 793 of the Companies Act, the Issuer may give notice to any person whom the Issuer knows or has reasonable cause to believe
(a) to be interested in the shares of the Issuer or (b) to have been so interested at any time during the three years immediately preceding the date on which the notice is issued. The notice may require the person (a) to state whether
or not it is the case and (b) if it holds, or has during that time held, any such interest, to give such further information as may be required by the Issuer in accordance with section 793 of the Companies Act. The notice may require the person
to give particulars of its present or past interest in the Issuers shares and the information required by the notice must be given within such reasonable time as may be specified in the notice. Where a notice is served by the Issuer on a
person under section 793 of the Companies Act and that person fails to give the Issuer the information required by the notice within the time specified in it, the Issuer may apply to the court for an order directing that the shares in question be
subject to restrictions.  Differences in Corporate Law 
The applicable provisions of the Companies Act differ from laws applicable to U.S. corporations organized in Delaware and their
shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of certain differences between the provisions of the Companies Act applicable to the Issuer and the Delaware General Corporation Law relating to shareholders rights and protections. This summary is
not intended to be a complete discussion of the respective rights and it is qualified in its entirety by reference to English law and Delaware law.

Number of Directors
  
Under the Companies Act, a public limited company must have at least
  
Under Delaware law, a corporation must have at least one director and

two directors and at least one of the directors must be a natural person. Subject to the Companies Act, the number of directors may be fixed by or in the manner provided in a companys articles of association.
  
the number of directors shall be fixed by or in the manner provided in the bylaws.

Removal of Directors
  
Under the Companies Act, shareholders may remove a director without cause by an ordinary resolution (which is passed by a simple majority of those voting in person or by proxy at a general meeting) irrespective of any provisions of
any service contract the director has with the company, provided that 28 clear days notice of the resolution is given to the company and its shareholders and certain other procedural requirements under the Companies Act are followed (such as
allowing the director to make representations against his or her removal either at the meeting or in writing).
  
Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, directors may be removed from office, with or without cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote, though in the case of
a corporation whose board is classified, stockholders may typically effect such removal only for cause.





 Vacancies on the Board of Directors
  
Under English law, the procedure by which directors (other than a companys initial directors) are appointed is generally set out in a companys articles of association, provided that where two or more persons are
appointed as directors of a public limited company by ordinary resolution of the shareholders, resolutions appointing each director must be voted on individually unless a resolution that more than one director can be appointed has first been agreed
to by the meeting without any vote being given against it.
  
Under Delaware law, vacancies on a corporations board of directors, including those caused by an increase in the number of directors, may be filled as the bylaws provided. In the absence of such provision, the vacancy shall be
filled by a majority of the board of directors.





 Annual General Meeting
  
Under the Companies Act, a public limited company must hold an annual general meeting in each six-month period following the end of the companys fiscal year.
  
Under Delaware law, the annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such place, on such date and at such time as may be designated by or in the manner provided in the certificate
of

incorporation or bylaws, or if not so designated, as determined by a majority of the board of directors.





 General Meeting/Special Meeting
  
 Under the Companies Act, a general meeting of the shareholders of a public limited company may be called by:
  (i) the directors; or
  (ii) shareholders holding at least 5% of the paid-up capital of the company carrying
voting rights at general meetings (excluding treasury shares).
  
Under Delaware law, special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the board of directors or by such person or persons as may be authorized by the certificate of incorporation or by the bylaws.





 Notice of General Meetings
  
Under the Companies Act, 21 clear days notice must be given for an annual general meeting and any resolutions to be proposed at the meeting. Subject to a companys articles of association providing for a longer period, at
least 14 clear days notice is required for any other general meeting. In addition, certain matters (such as the removal of directors or auditors) require special notice, which is 28 clear days notice. The shareholders of a company may in
all cases consent to a shorter notice period, the proportion of shareholders consent required being 100% of those entitled to attend and vote in the case of an annual general meeting and, in the case of any other general meeting, a majority in
number of the shareholders having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, being a majority who together hold not less than 95% in nominal value of the shares giving a right to attend and vote at the meeting.
  
Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws, written notice of any meeting to the stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting not less than ten nor more than 60 days before the date of
the meeting and shall specify the place, date, hour and purpose or purposes of the meeting.





 Proxy
  
Under the Companies Act, at any meeting of shareholders, a shareholder may designate another person to attend, speak and vote at the meeting on their behalf by proxy.
  
Under Delaware law, each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for
such

stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.





 Pre-emptive Rights
  
Under the Companies Act, equity securities (being (i) shares in the company other than shares that, with respect to dividends and capital, carry a right to participate only up to a specified amount in a distribution
(ordinary shares) or (ii) rights to subscribe for, or to convert securities into, ordinary shares) must not be allotted unless: (i) offered first, on the same or more favorable terms, to the existing ordinary shareholders in the company
in proportion as nearly as practicable to the respective nominal value of their holdings of ordinary shares and (ii) the period during which any such offer may be accepted has expired or the company has received notice of the acceptance or refusal
of every offer so made. Such pre-emption provisions do not apply if: (i) the allotment is of bonus shares or (ii) the allotment is to be wholly or partly paid up otherwise than in cash or (iii) the allotment is pursuant to an employees share
scheme. Where the directors of a company are generally authorized to allot or grant equity securities in the company, they may be given power by the articles of association or by a special resolution of the company to allot equity securities as if
the shareholders rights of pre-emption did not apply to the allotment (or with such modifications as the directors may determine).
  
Under Delaware law, no stockholder shall have any pre- emptive right to subscribe to an additional issue of stock or to any security convertible into such stock unless, and except to the extent that, such right is expressly granted
to such stockholder in the certificate of incorporation.





 Liability of Directors and Officers
  
Under the Companies Act, any provision (whether contained in a companys articles of association or any contract or otherwise) that
  
Under Delaware law, the certificate of incorporation may include a provision eliminating or limiting the personal liability of a
   185

 purports to exempt a director of a company (to any extent) from any liability that would otherwise attach to him in connection with any
negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company is void.  
Any provision by which a company directly or indirectly provides an indemnity (to any extent) for a director of the company or of an associated company against
any liability attaching to him in connection with any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company of which he is a director is also void except as permitted by the Companies Act, which provides exceptions for
the company to (a) purchase and maintain insurance against such liability; (b) provide a qualifying third party indemnity (being an indemnity against liability incurred by the director to a person other than the company or an associated
company as long as he is successful in defending the claim or criminal proceedings); and (c) provide a qualifying pension scheme indemnity (being an indemnity against liability incurred in connection with the companys activities as
trustee of an occupational pension plan).
  
director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, provided that such provision shall not eliminate or limit the liability of a director: (i) For any breach of the
directors duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (iii) intentional or negligent payment of unlawful dividends
or unlawful stock purchases or redemptions; or (iv) for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.





 Voting Rights
  
Under English law, unless a poll is demanded by the shareholders of a company or is required by the chairman of the meeting or the companys articles of association, shareholders shall vote on all resolutions on a show of
hands. Under the Companies Act, a poll may be demanded by (a) not fewer than five shareholders having the right to vote on the resolution; (b) any shareholder(s) representing at least 10% of the total voting rights
  
Under Delaware law, unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such
stockholder.

 of all the shareholders having the right to vote on the resolution (excluding any voting rights attached to treasury shares); or (c) any
shareholder(s) holding shares in the company conferring a right to vote on the resolution being shares on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than 10% of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right. A
companys articles of association may provide more extensive rights for shareholders to call a poll.  
Under English law, an ordinary resolution is passed on a show of hands if it is approved by a simple majority (more than 50%) of the shareholders present (in
person or by proxy) and entitled to vote and voting at a meeting. If a poll is demanded, an ordinary resolution is passed if it is approved by holders
representing a simple majority of the total voting rights of the shareholders present (in person or by proxy) who (being entitled to vote) vote on the resolution.
  







  
A companys articles may contain provisions to the effect that on a vote on a resolution on a poll taken at a meeting, the votes may include votes cast in advance. Any such provision in relation to voting at a general meeting
may be made subject only to such requirements and restrictions as are (a) necessary to ensure the identification of the person voting, and (b) proportionate to the achievement of that objective. Any provision of a companys articles is
void in so far as it would have the effect of requiring any document casting a vote in advance to be received by the company or another person earlier

than (a) in the case of a poll taken more than 48 hours after it was demanded, 24 hours before the time appointed for the taking of the poll; or (b) in the case of any other poll, 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or
adjourned meeting.
  







  
Special resolutions require the affirmative vote of not less than 75% of the votes cast by shareholders present (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote at the meeting. If a poll is demanded, a special resolution is passed if it
is approved by holders representing not less than 75% of the total voting rights of shareholders present (in person or by proxy) who (being entitled to vote) vote on the resolution.
  






 Shareholder Vote on Certain Transactions
  
 The Companies Act provides for schemes of arrangement, which are arrangements or compromises between a company and any class of shareholders
or creditors and used in certain types of reconstructions, amalgamations, capital reorganisations or takeovers.  
The court may order a meeting of the creditors, or class of creditors, or shareholders, or class of shareholders, on an application by (i) the company, (ii)
any creditor or shareholder of the company or (iii) the liquidator or administrator of the company.  
The court may sanction the compromise or arrangement if 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors or shareholders or class of shareholders (as the
case may be), present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting summoned, agree a compromise or arrangement.  
  
Generally, under Delaware law, unless the certificate of incorporation provides for the vote of a larger portion of the stock, completion of a merger, consolidation, sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all of a
corporations assets or dissolution requires: (i) the approval of the board of directors; and (ii) approval by the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding stock or, if the certificate of incorporation provides for more or less than
one vote per share, a majority of the votes of the outstanding stock of a corporation entitled to vote on the matter.

The courts order has no effect until the delivery of the court order to the registrar.
  






 Standard of Conduct for Directors
  
 Under English law, a director owes various statutory and fiduciary duties to the company, including:
  (i) a duty to act in accordance with the companys constitution and only exercise
his or her powers for which they are conferred;   (ii) a duty to promote the success
of the company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole;   (iii) a duty to
exercise independent judgment;   (iv) a duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and
diligence;   (v) a duty to avoid conflicts of interest;
  (vi) a duty not to accept benefits from third parties conferred by reason of his being a
director or doing (or not doing) anything as a director; and   (vii) a duty to declare
any interest that he has, whether directly or indirectly, in a proposed or existing transaction or arrangement.
  
Delaware law does not contain specific provisions setting forth the standard of conduct of a director. The scope of the fiduciary duties of directors is generally determined by the courts of the State of Delaware. In general,
directors have two basic fiduciary duties, the duty of care and the duty of loyalty, owned to the corporation itself and the stockholders; that is, directors must (i) act in good faith, with the care of a prudent person, and in the best interest of
the corporation; and (ii) refrain from self-dealing, usurping corporate opportunities and receiving improper personal benefits. Decisions made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action was taken in the best
interest of the corporation will generally be protected by the business judgment rule.





 Shareholder Suits
  
Under English law, generally, the company, rather than its shareholders, is the proper claimant in an action in respect of a wrong done to the company or where there is an irregularity in the companys internal management.
Notwithstanding this general position, the Companies Act provides that (i) a court may allow a shareholder to bring a derivative claim (that is, an action in respect of and on behalf of the company) in respect of a cause of action arising from a
directors negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust and (ii) a
  
Under Delaware law, a stockholder is eligible to bring a derivative action, that is a lawsuit brought by a stockholder, on behalf of the corporation, to enforce a claim belonging to the corporation, if the holder held stock at the
time of the challenged wrongdoing and continues from that time to hold stock throughout the course of the litigation. Delaware law also requires the stockholder to first demand that the board of directors of the corporation asserts the claims or the
stockholder must state in the derivative action particular reasons why making such a demand would be futile.

shareholder of a company may apply to the court by petition for an order on the ground (a) that the companys affairs are being or have been conducted in a manner that is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of shareholders
generally or of some part of its shareholders (including at least himself or herself), or (b) that an actual or proposed act or omission of the company (including an act or omission on its behalf) is or would be so prejudicial.
  

 Exchange Controls 
There are no governmental laws, decrees, regulations or other legislation in the United Kingdom that may affect the import or export of
capital, including the availability of cash and cash equivalents for use by us, or which may affect the remittance of dividends, interest, or other payments by us to non-resident holders of our ordinary shares, other than withholding tax
requirements. There is no limitation imposed by U.K. law or the Issuers Articles on the right of non-residents to hold or vote shares. 
Exclusive Forum 
Our Articles will provide that, unless, by ordinary resolution, we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the courts of
England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a member in that members capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in the Company or
seeking relief on behalf of the Company, against the Company and/or the board and/or any of the directors, officers or other employees or stockholders individually, arising out of or in connection with these Articles or (to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law) otherwise. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our ordinary shares will be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our Articles, including the exclusive forum
provisions in our Articles. However, it is possible that a court could find our forum selection provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable.

ordinary shares have been approved for listing on the NYSE under the symbol GTES.  Transfer Agent and Registrar

Depositary Receipts  In connection with
the pre-IPO reorganization transactions described under SummaryOur Organizational Structure, our Sponsor and the other equity owners of Omaha Topco will receive depositary receipts, each representing one ordinary share in Gates
Industrial Corporation plc in consideration for their equity in Omaha Topco, at a ratio of 0.76293 of our ordinary shares for each outstanding share of Omaha Topco. The depositary

Table of Contents

  
receipts will be issued by the Depositary, and the Depositary Nominee will be the registered holder of the ordinary shares of Gates Industrial Corporation plc issued in exchange for the
outstanding shares of Omaha Topco.  The depositary receipts arrangement is being established because, as a result of restrictions on
transfer on certain of the ordinary shares concerned, those ordinary shares cannot be issued directly into DTC at the time of this offering. The use of the Depositary allows for the shares to be held in the Depositary initially and subsequently
transferred into DTC without the application of U.K. stamp duty or SDRT, provided certain conditions are met. See TaxationMaterial U.K. Tax ConsiderationsStamp Duty and SDRTDepositary arrangements and clearance services
for more information. The depositary receipts will not be registered or listed on the NYSE or any other stock exchange, will not be eligible for DTC, and no trading market for them is expected to develop. Instead, subject to compliance with
applicable securities laws and contractual restrictions on transfer, the pre-IPO owners may request of the Depositary that all or a portion of their depositary receipts be cancelled in order to effectuate a transfer of the ordinary shares underlying
such depositary receipts to Cede & Co., as nominee/custodian for DTC, which will hold the transferred ordinary shares on its customary terms, in order to settle trades of such ordinary shares (in the public market or otherwise), or to otherwise
hold or transfer such shares through and within the systems of DTC.  Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws and contractual
restrictions on transfer, the holders of the depositary receipts will generally be entitled to the same rights as a direct holder of our ordinary shares or an investor holding book-entry interests in our ordinary shares through DTC. 
A holder of depositary receipts will be entitled to withdraw the ordinary shares underlying its depositary receipts from the Depositary upon
the surrender of such depositary receipts to the Depositary and the delivery of applicable transfer documentation. See Taxation  Material U.K. Tax Considerations  Stamp Duty and SDRT, in relation to the stamp duty and SDRT
consequences.

 TAXATION 
Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders 
The following discussion describes certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our
ordinary shares as of the date hereof. This discussion deals only with ordinary shares that are held as capital assets by a United States Holder (as defined below). In addition, the discussion set forth below is applicable only to United States
Holders (i) who are residents of the United States for purposes of the current United States-United Kingdom Income Tax Treaty (the Treaty), (ii) whose ordinary shares are not, for purposes of the Treaty, effectively connected
with a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom and (iii) who otherwise qualify for the full benefits of the Treaty.  As
used herein, the term United States Holder means a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: 
 


 

 
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;   


 

 
a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
  


 

 
an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or   


 

 
a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has
a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. 
This discussion is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and regulations, rulings and
judicial decisions thereunder as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. 
This discussion does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are
subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws, including if you are:   


 

 
a dealer in securities or currencies;   


 

 
a financial institution;   


 

 
a regulated investment company;   


 

 
a real estate investment trust;   


 

 
an insurance company;   


 

 
a tax-exempt organization;   


 

 
a person holding our ordinary shares as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction, a constructive sale or a straddle;   



 

 
a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities;   


 

 
a person liable for alternative minimum tax;   


 

 
a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of our voting stock;   


 

 
a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes; or   


 

 
a person whose functional currency is not the United States dollar. 
   192 




Table of Contents

 If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax
purposes) holds our ordinary shares, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our ordinary shares, you should consult
your tax advisors.  This discussion does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any state, local or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of our ordinary
shares, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, as well as the consequences to you arising under other
United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.  Taxation of Dividends 
The gross amount of distributions on the ordinary shares will be taxable as dividends to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated
earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, the distribution will first be
treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the tax basis of the ordinary shares, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds your tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain recognized on a sale or exchange.
We do not, however, expect to determine earnings and profits in accordance with United States federal income tax principles. Therefore, you should expect that a distribution will generally be treated as a dividend. 
Any dividends that you receive will be includable in your gross income as ordinary income on the day actually or constructively received by
you. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the Code.  With respect to
non-corporate United States Holders, certain dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a
comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States which the United States Treasury Department determines to be satisfactory for these purposes and which includes an exchange of information provision. The United States Treasury Department has
determined that the Treaty meets these requirements. Even if we were not to qualify for the Treaty, a foreign corporation is also treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends paid by that corporation on shares that are
readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. United States Treasury Department guidance indicates that our ordinary shares, which will be listed on the NYSE, will be readily tradable on an established securities market
in the United States. There can be no assurance, however, that our ordinary shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years. Non-corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement
during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as investment income pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation
regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or
related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to your particular circumstances. 
Non-corporate United States Holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from us if we are a passive
foreign investment company in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year (see Passive Foreign Investment Company below). 
Distributions of ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for ordinary shares that are received as part of a pro rata distribution to all of our
shareholders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax. 
   193 




Table of Contents

 Passive Foreign Investment Company 
We do not believe that we are, for United States federal income tax purposes, a passive foreign investment company (a PFIC), and we
expect to operate in such a manner so as not to become a PFIC. If, however, we are or become a PFIC, you could be subject to additional United States federal income taxes on gain recognized with respect to the ordinary shares and on certain
distributions, plus an interest charge on certain taxes treated as having been deferred under the PFIC rules.  Taxation of Capital
Gains  For United States federal income tax purposes, you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale or exchange of the
ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized for the ordinary shares and your tax basis in the ordinary shares. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will generally be long-term capital gain
or loss if you have held the ordinary shares for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate United States Holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Any gain or loss recognized by you will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.  You should note that any
United Kingdom stamp duty or SDRT, if any, will not be treated as a creditable foreign tax for United States federal income tax purposes, although you may be entitled to deduct such taxes, subject to applicable limitations under the Code. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding 
In general, information reporting will apply to dividends in respect of our ordinary shares and the proceeds from the sale, exchange or other
disposition of our ordinary shares that are paid to you within the United States (and in certain cases, outside the United States), unless you are an exempt recipient. A backup withholding tax may apply to such payments if you fail to provide a
taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status or fail to report in full dividend and interest income.  Backup
withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.  Material U.K. Tax Considerations 
The following comments do not constitute tax advice and are intended only as a general guide. They relate only to certain limited aspects of
the U.K. tax consequences of holding or disposing of ordinary shares and are based on current U.K. tax law and what is understood to be HMRCs current published practice as at the date of this document (which are both subject to change at any
time (in particular in light of Brexit), possibly with retrospective effect). The rates and allowances for 2017/18 stated in the U.K. tax section below reflect the current law. 
The comments below are intended to apply only to shareholders: (i) who are resident (and, in the case of individuals, domiciled) in
(and only in) the U.K. for U.K. tax purposes (unless the position of non-U.K. resident shareholders is expressly referred to); (ii) to whom split-year treatment does not apply; (iii) who are and will be the absolute beneficial owners of
their ordinary shares and any dividends paid in respect of them; (iv) who hold, and will hold, their ordinary shares as investments (otherwise than through an individual savings account or a pension arrangement) and not as securities to be
realised in the course of a trade; (v) who hold less than 5% of the ordinary shares; and (vi) to whom the U.K. tax rules concerning carried interest do not apply in relation to their holding or disposal of ordinary shares. 
The comments below may not apply to certain shareholders, such as (but not limited to) persons who are connected with the Company, dealers
in securities, broker dealers, insurance companies, charities, collective

investment schemes, pension schemes, shareholders who are exempt from U.K. taxation, shareholders who acquire or acquired their ordinary shares under the 2014 Incentive Plan, the 2015
Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan, the Omnibus Incentive Plan or any other employee incentive plan and shareholders who acquire or acquired (or are deemed to have acquired) their ordinary shares by virtue of an office or employment. Such
shareholders may be subject to special rules.  The material set out in the paragraphs below does not constitute tax advice and
these paragraphs do not describe all of the circumstances in which holders of our ordinary shares may benefit from an exemption or relief from U.K. taxation. Shareholders who are in any doubt as to their tax position or who are subject to tax in a
jurisdiction other than the U.K. should consult an appropriate professional adviser. In particular, non-U.K. resident or domiciled persons are advised to consider the potential impact of any relevant double tax agreements. 
The statements below relating to U.K. stamp duty and SDRT are subject to the comments made in the section entitled Risks Related to
this Offering and Ownership of our Ordinary SharesTransfers of our shares outside DTC may be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in our shares of this prospectus. 
Direct Taxation of Dividends 
Liability to U.K. income tax or U.K. corporation tax on income in respect of dividends payable on the ordinary shares will depend upon the
individual circumstances of the shareholder. An overview of the U.K. tax rules applicable to dividends is set out below.  U.K.
withholding tax  There is no U.K. withholding tax on dividends paid by the Company. 
Individual shareholders within the charge to U.K. income tax 
When the Company pays a dividend to a shareholder who is an individual resident (for tax purposes) and domiciled in the U.K., the amount of
income tax payable on the receipt, if any, will depend on the individuals own personal tax position. Dividend income for these purposes includes U.K. and non U.K. source dividends and certain other distributions in respect of
shares.  No U.K. income tax should be payable by a U.K. resident shareholder if the amount of dividend income received, when aggregated
with the shareholders other dividend income in the year of assessment, does not exceed the nil rate amount. The nil rate amount is £5,000 for 2017/2018, and is expected to be £2,000 for 2018/2019. Dividend income in excess of the
nil rate amount is taxed at the following rates for 2017/2018:   


 

 
7.5% to the extent that it falls below the threshold for higher rate income tax;   


 

 
32.5% to the extent it falls within the higher rate band; and   


 

 
38.1% to the extent it falls within the additional rate band.  For the purposes of determining
which of the taxable bands dividend income falls into, dividend income is treated as the highest part of a shareholders income. In addition dividend income which is within the nil rate amount counts towards an individuals basic or higher
rate limits and so will be taken into account in determining whether the threshold for higher rate or additional rate income tax is exceeded. 
Other Individual Shareholders 
Individual shareholders who are not resident or domiciled in the U.K. and who hold their ordinary shares as an investment and not in connection
with any trade carried on by them would not generally be subject to U.K. tax on dividends received from the Company.

Table of Contents

 Corporate Shareholders within the charge to U.K. corporation tax 
Shareholders within the charge to corporation tax that are small companies (for the purposes of U.K. taxation of dividends) will
not generally expect to be subject to tax on dividends from the Company provided certain conditions are met (including an anti-avoidance condition). 
Other shareholders within the charge to U.K. corporation tax (which are not a small company for the purposes of U.K. taxation of
dividends) should not be subject to tax on dividends from the Company so long as the dividends fall within an exempt class and certain conditions are met. In general, (i) dividends paid on non-redeemable ordinary shares (that is,
non-redeemable shares that do not carry any present or future preferential rights to dividends or to the Companys assets on its winding up); and (ii) dividends paid to a U.K. resident corporate shareholder holding less than 10% of the
issued share capital of the class in respect of which the dividend is paid, should fall within an exempt class and so accordingly we would generally expect dividends paid by the Company not to be subject to U.K. corporation tax. However, it should
be noted that the exemptions are not comprehensive and are subject to anti-avoidance rules. Shareholders will need to ensure that they satisfy the requirements of any exempt class and that no anti-avoidance rules apply before treating any dividend
as exempt, and seek appropriate professional advice where necessary.  Other Corporate Shareholders 
Corporate shareholders which are not resident in and have no permanent establishment in the U.K. and which hold their ordinary shares as an
investment and not in connection with any trade carried on by them would not generally be subject to U.K. tax on dividends received from the Company. 
Chargeable Gains 
Individuals resident in the U.K. 
A disposal (or deemed disposal) of ordinary shares by a U.K. resident individual shareholder may give rise to a chargeable gain (or allowable
loss) for the purposes of U.K. capital gains tax, depending on the circumstances and subject to any available exemption or relief. No indexation allowance will be available to an individual holder of ordinary shares in respect of any disposal of
ordinary shares. However, the capital gains tax annual exemption (which is £11,300 for individuals in the 2017/18 tax year) may be available to exempt any chargeable gain, to the extent that the exemption has not already been utilised. 
Capital gains tax on share disposals by a U.K. resident individual shareholder will generally be charged at 10% to the extent that the total
chargeable gains and, generally, total taxable income arising in a tax year, after all allowable deductions (including losses, the income tax personal allowance and the capital gains tax annual exempt amount), are less than the upper limit of the
income tax basic rate band. To the extent that any chargeable gains (or part of any chargeable gains) arising in a tax year exceed the upper limit of the income tax basic rate band when aggregated with any such income (in the manner referred to
above), capital gains tax will generally be charged at 20%.  Other Individual Shareholders 
An individual shareholder who is not resident or domiciled in the U.K. should not be liable to U.K. capital gains tax on capital gains realized
on the disposal of his or her ordinary shares unless such shareholder carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the U.K. through a branch or agency in the U.K. to which the ordinary shares are attributable. 
An individual shareholder who is temporarily non-resident for U.K. tax purposes will, in certain circumstances, become liable to U.K. tax on
capital gains in respect of gains realized while he or she was not resident in the U.K. 
   196 




Table of Contents

 Corporate Shareholders resident in the U.K. 
A disposal (or deemed disposal) of ordinary shares by a U.K. resident corporate shareholder may give rise to a chargeable gain (or allowable
loss) for the purposes of U.K. corporation tax, depending on the circumstances and subject to any available exemption or relief. The main rate of U.K. corporation tax is currently 19% with effect from April 1, 2017. 
Other Corporate Shareholders 
A corporate holder of ordinary shares that is not resident in the U.K. and has no permanent establishment in the U.K. (including one to which
the ordinary shares are attributable) should not be liable for U.K. corporation tax on chargeable gains realized on the disposal of ordinary shares. 
Stamp Duty and SDRT 
The following statements are intended as a general guide to the current U.K. stamp duty and SDRT position, and apply regardless of whether or
not a shareholder is resident or domiciled in the U.K. It should be noted that certain categories of persons, including market makers, brokers, dealers, and other specified market intermediaries, are entitled to exemption from stamp duty and SDRT in
respect of purchases of securities in specified circumstances.  General rules 
As a general rule, no stamp duty or SDRT is payable on an issuance of shares in a U.K. company, but transfers of shares in a U.K. company will
attract a stamp duty or SDRT charge equal to 0.5% of the consideration for the shares, rounded up to the nearest £5 in the case of stamp duty. 
Depositary arrangements and clearance services 
Special rules apply where ordinary shares are issued or transferred to, or to a nominee or agent for, either a person whose business is or
includes issuing depositary receipts within section 67 or section 93 Finance Act 1986 or a person providing a clearance service within section 70 or section 96 of the Finance Act 1986, under which stamp duty or SDRT may be charged at a higher rate
of 1.5%. However, where a clearance service has made and maintained an election under section 97A Finance Act 1986, the 1.5% charge will not apply as transfers of ordinary shares into and within that clearance service would then be subject to stamp
duty or SDRT at the normal 0.5% rate. We understand that HMRC regards DTC as a clearance service for these purposes and that no relevant election under section 97A(1) has been made. 
However, on the basis of recent case law HMRC has confirmed that it will no longer seek to impose stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% on
issues of U.K. shares to depositary receipt issuers and clearance systems, or on transfers of such shares to such issuers and systems where those transfers are integral to the raising of capital by a company. However, HMRCs view is that the
relevant case law does not have any impact upon the transfer (on sale or otherwise than on sale) of shares or securities to depositary receipt systems or clearance services that are not an integral part of an issue of share capital and so the 1.5%
SDRT or stamp duty charge will continue to apply to such transfers and therefore if ordinary shares are withdrawn from the facilities of DTC, a charge to stamp duty or SDRT at 1.5% may arise on a subsequent redeposit of ordinary shares into the
facilities of DTC.   In connection with the completion of this offering, we expect to put in place arrangements to require that our
ordinary shares held outside the facilities of DTC cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the ordinary shares has first delivered the ordinary shares to a depositary specified by us so that stamp duty (and/or SDRT) may be
collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depositary. Any such ordinary shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depositary. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put
the depositary in funds to settle the resultant liability to stamp duty (and/or SDRT), which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares. 
   197 




Table of Contents

 It should also be noted that the 1.5% charge for all issues of shares into depositary
receipt systems and clearance services remains as a provision of U.K. statute and that the removal of the 1.5% charge is based upon the provisions of EU law. There is therefore a risk that this could be affected by the U.K.s decision to leave
the EU. The 2017 Autumn Budget included a statement that the government will not reintroduce the 1.5% charge on the issue of shares (and transfers integral to capital raising) into clearance services following the U.K.s exit from the E.U., but
the charge will remain as a provision of U.K. statute. To the extent that U.K. law is changed, including as a result of the U.K.s decision to leave the E.U., restrictive measures may be taken in relation to trading in the Companys
shares. Specific professional advice should be sought before incurring a 1.5% stamp duty or SDRT charge in any circumstances.  Transfers
of ordinary shares within a clearance system or depositary receipt system should not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. provided that there is no written instrument of transfer and no election is, or has been, made by the clearance
system under section 97A Finance Act 1986.  Transfers of ordinary shares within a clearance system where an election has been made by the
clearance system under section 97A Finance Act 1986 will generally be subject to SDRT (rather than stamp duty) at a rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration. 
The transfer on sale of ordinary shares (outside the facilities of a clearance service such as DTC) by a written instrument of transfer will
generally be liable to U.K. stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration for the transfer. The purchaser normally pays the stamp duty. 
An agreement to transfer ordinary shares (outside the facilities of a clearance service such as DTC) will generally give rise to a liability
on the purchaser to SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration, but where an instrument of transfer is executed and duly stamped before the expiry of a period of six years beginning with the date of that agreement, (i) any
SDRT that has not been paid ceases to be payable, and (ii) any SDRT that has been paid may be recovered from HMRC, generally with interest. 
A share buy-back by the Company of ordinary shares will give rise to stamp duty at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration payable by the
Company, and such stamp duty will be paid by the Company.

 SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ordinary shares. We cannot predict the effect, if any, future sales of our
ordinary shares, or the availability for future sale of our ordinary shares, will have on the market price of our ordinary shares prevailing from time to time. The sale of substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, or the
perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares and could impair our future ability to raise capital through the sale of our equity or equity-related securities at a time and price that we deem
appropriate. See Risk FactorsRisks Related to this Offering and Ownership of our Ordinary SharesIf we or our pre-IPO owners sell additional ordinary shares after this offering, the market price of our ordinary shares could
decline.   Upon completion of this offering, we will have a total of 283,974,605 ordinary shares outstanding (or 289,749,605
ordinary shares if the underwriters exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase additional ordinary shares). Of the outstanding ordinary shares, the 38,500,000 ordinary shares sold in this offering (or 44,275,000 ordinary
shares if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except that any ordinary shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined
under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, may be sold only in compliance with the limitations described below. The remaining outstanding 245,474,605 ordinary shares held by our pre-IPO owners and management after this offering may be sold in the
public market only if registered or if they qualify for an exemption from registration, including the exemption pursuant to Rule 144 which we summarize below. 
We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register our ordinary shares or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for our ordinary shares issued pursuant to the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2015 Non-Employee Director Incentive Plan and the Omnibus Incentive Plan. Any such Form S-8 registration statements will automatically
become effective upon filing. Accordingly, our ordinary shares registered under such registration statements will be available for sale in the open market. We expect that the initial registration statement on Form S-8 will cover 33,374,308
ordinary shares.   Registration Rights 
In connection with this offering, we intend to enter into a new registration rights agreement to provide to our Sponsor an unlimited number of
demand registration rights. The registration rights agreement also provides our Sponsor customary piggyback registration rights. The registration rights agreement also provides that we will pay certain expenses relating to
such registrations and indemnify our Sponsor against certain liabilities which may arise under the Securities Act. See Certain Relationships and Related Person TransactionsRegistration Rights Agreement. 
Lock-Up Agreements  We have agreed,
subject to enumerated exceptions, that we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, or file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to, any of our ordinary shares
or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of our ordinary shares, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge, disposition or filing, without the prior written consent of Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus.   Our officers, directors and
certain of our pre-IPO owners that collectively own 98.6% of our shares, on a fully diluted basis before giving effect to this offering, have agreed, subject to enumerated exceptions, that they will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or
otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of our ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of our ordinary shares, enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap,
hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of our ordinary shares, whether any of these

transactions are to be settled by delivery of our ordinary shares or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or
disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of this
prospectus.  10b5-1 Plans  Prior to
or after the completion of the offering, certain of our employees, including our executive officers, and/or directors may enter into written trading plans that are intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. Sales under these trading
plans would not be permitted until the expiration of the lock-up agreements relating to the offering described above.  Rule 144 
In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, a person who is not deemed to be our affiliate for purposes of Rule 144 or to have been one
of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned our ordinary shares proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is
entitled to sell those ordinary shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned
the ordinary shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then that person is entitled to sell those ordinary shares without complying with any of the requirements of
Rule 144. In general, six months after the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling ordinary shares on behalf of our affiliates are
entitled to sell, within any three-month period, a number of ordinary shares that does not exceed the greater of (1) 1% of the number of ordinary shares then outstanding and (2) the average weekly trading volume of ordinary shares during
the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to that sale. Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling ordinary shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale
provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.

the representatives, respectively. The underwriters are offering our ordinary shares subject to their acceptance of the ordinary shares from us. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay
for and accept delivery of our ordinary shares offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of our ordinary
shares offered by this prospectus if any such ordinary shares are taken. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for our ordinary shares covered by the underwriters over-allotment option described below. 
The underwriters initially propose to offer part of our ordinary shares directly to the public at the offering price listed on the cover page
of this prospectus and part to certain dealers. After the initial offering of our ordinary shares, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives. 
We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 5,775,000
additional ordinary shares at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any,
made in connection with the offering of our ordinary shares offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase about the same percentage of the
additional ordinary shares as the number listed next to the underwriters name in the preceding table bears to the total number of ordinary shares listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.

the pledge, hypothecation or other granting of a security interest in ordinary shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares or such securities by our Sponsor to one or more lending
institutions as collateral or security for any loan, advance or extension of credit and any transfer upon foreclosure upon such ordinary shares or thereafter, provided that our Sponsor or we, as the case may be, shall provide Citigroup Global
Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC prior written notice informing them of any public filing, report or announcement made with respect to such pledge, hypothecation or other grant of a security interest. 
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, in their sole discretion, may release our ordinary shares and other
securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time.  In order to facilitate the offering of our
ordinary shares, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of our ordinary shares. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more ordinary shares than they are obligated to purchase under the
underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of ordinary shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-allotment option. The underwriters can close
out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing ordinary shares in the open market. In determining the source of our ordinary shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other
things, the open market price of our ordinary shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell our ordinary shares in excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The
underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing our ordinary shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our
ordinary shares in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, our ordinary shares in the open
market to stabilize the price of our ordinary shares. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of our ordinary shares above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of our ordinary shares. The
underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.  We and the underwriters have
agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.  A prospectus in electronic
format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering. The representatives may agree to allocate a number of our ordinary shares to underwriters for sale to
their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by the representatives to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.

 Pricing of the Offering 
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our ordinary shares. The initial public offering price was determined by
negotiations among us and the representatives. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and certain other financial and
operating information in recent periods, and the price-earnings ratios, price-sales ratios, market prices of securities, and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours. 
Conflicts of Interest  Affiliates of
Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares. Because Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is an underwriter in this offering and its affiliates own in excess of 10% of our issued and outstanding
ordinary shares, Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. is deemed to have a conflict of interest under FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with the requirements of Rule 5121. Pursuant to that rule, the
appointment of a qualified independent underwriter is not required in connection with this offering as the members primarily responsible for managing the public offering do not have a conflict of interest, are not affiliates of any
member that has a conflict of interest and meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(12)(E) of Rule 5121. Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. will not confirm sales of the securities to any account over which they exercise discretionary authority without
the specific written approval of the account holder.  Other Relationships 
The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates
have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. 
In addition, in the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long
and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. In addition, certain of the underwriters
or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents or managers for the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities.  Selling Restrictions

The financial statement included in this prospectus of Gates Industrial Corporation plc has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing herein. Such financial statement is included in reliance upon the report of such firm given upon their authority as experts in accounting and auditing. 
The financial statements included in this prospectus of Omaha Topco Ltd. as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016 and for the years ended
December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the period from July 3, 2014 through January 3, 2015 (Successor) and the period from January 1, 2014 through July 2, 2014 (Predecessor) have been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent

ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES 
We are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. We have been advised that there is some doubt as to the enforceability in the United
Kingdom, in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of U.S. courts, of civil liabilities based solely on the federal securities laws of the United States. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions brought in the United
States or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the United Kingdom. An award for monetary damages under the U.S. securities laws would be considered punitive if it does not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and is intended to
punish the defendant. The enforceability of any judgment in the United Kingdom will depend on the particular facts of the case as well as the laws and treaties in effect at the time. The United States and the United Kingdom do not currently have a
treaty providing for recognition and enforcement of judgments (other than arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of  Gates Industrial
Corporation plc  London, United Kingdom  We have audited the
accompanying balance sheet of Gates Industrial Corporation plc (the Company) as of September 25, 2017. This financial statement is the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
this financial statement based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the balance sheet is free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the balance sheet, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall balance sheet presentation. We believe that our audit of the balance sheet provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.  In our opinion, such balance sheet presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Gates Industrial Corporation plc as
of September 25, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Denver, Colorado  We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Omaha Topco Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company), the successor of Pinafore Holdings B.V (Predecessor), as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and shareholders equity for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the period from July 3, 2014 through January 3, 2015 (Successor), and the period from
January 1, 2014 through July 2, 2014 (Predecessor). These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Omaha Topco Ltd. and subsidiaries
as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, the period from July 3, 2014 through January 3, 2015 (Successor), and the period from
January 1, 2014 through July 2, 2014 (Predecessor), in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company was acquired on July 3, 2014. As a result of the transaction, the consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the acquisition are presented on a different
cost basis than that prior to the acquisition and, therefore, are not comparable. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.  /s/ Deloitte

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. Background  Omaha Topco Ltd. (the Company)
was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 12, 2014. On July 3, 2014, the Company acquired, through an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, the entire equity interest in Pinafore Holdings B.V. for $5.4 billion (the
Acquisition). Gates Global LLC, another indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was formed by investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone) primarily as a vehicle to finance the acquisition by
Blackstone and various investment funds managed by Blackstone. Following the Acquisition, Pinafore Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries (the Predecessor) is the predecessor to the group comprised of the Company and its subsidiaries (the
Successor).  In these consolidated financial statements and related notes, all references to the Gates, Group,
we, us, our refer, unless the context requires otherwise, in the periods prior to the Acquisition, to Pinafore Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries and, in the period subsequent to the Acquisition, to the Company
and its subsidiaries.  As the Company had and has no interest in any operations other than those of Pinafore Holdings B.V. and its subsidiaries,
comparison of the results of the Successor with those of the Predecessor is impacted only by the effects of the accounting for, and the financing of, the Acquisition. The Predecessor and Successor periods have been separated by a vertical line on
the face of the consolidated financial statements and related notes to highlight the fact that the financial information for such periods has been prepared under two different historical-cost bases of accounting. 
Gates manufactures a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications,
both in the aftermarket and first-fit channels, throughout the world. Gates is comprised of two operating segments: Power Transmission and Fluid Power. 
2. Significant accounting policies  A. Basis of
preparation  The consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated.  These consolidated financial
statements and related notes as of and for the Successor periods ended December 31, 2016, January 2, 2016 and January 3, 2015 have been prepared on a similar basis to the Predecessors consolidated financial statements and
related notes for the Predecessor period ended July 2, 2014.  The accounting policies used in preparing these consolidated financial statements and
related notes are the same as those applied in the prior period, except for the adoption of the following new Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) at the beginning of Fiscal 2016: 
 



 
ASU 2014-12 Accounting for Share-based Payments when the Terms of an Award Provide that a Performance Target Could be Achieved After the Requisite Service Period
(Topic 718): Stock Compensation

Adoption of the above new ASUs did not have a significant impact on Gates results or financial position during Fiscal 2016. 
B. Accounting periods  The Predecessor prepared its
annual consolidated financial statements to December 31. Comparative information is presented for the Predecessor portion of 2014 which consists of the period from January 1, 2014 through July 2, 2014 (Predecessor 2014). 
The Company prepares its annual consolidated financial statements to the Saturday nearest December 31. Accordingly, the Successor consolidated financial
statements are presented for the period from July 3, 2014 to January 3, 2015 (Successor 2014) and for the years ended January 2, 2016 (Fiscal 2015) and December 31, 2016 (Fiscal 2016). 
C. Basis of consolidation  The consolidated financial
statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of Gates and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and Gates share of the results of its equity method investees. 
Gates consolidates entities in which it has a controlling interest or when it is considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. 
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in Gates results from the effective date of acquisition. The results of a subsidiary
sold during the period are included in Gates results up to the effective date of disposal.  Intercompany transactions and balances, and any
unrealized profits or losses arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated on consolidation.  Investments in equity method investees 
An equity method investee (investee) is an entity over which one or more Gates entities are in a position to exercise significant influence by
participating in, but not controlling, the financial and operating policies of the entity. Such entities are accounted for using the equity method whereby the original investment is recorded at cost and (i) adjusted by Gates share of
undistributed earnings or losses of the investee determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, (ii) decreased by losses in the value of the investment that are determined to be other than temporary, and (iii) decreased by dividends
received.  Investments accounted for using the equity method are considered impaired when a loss in the value of the equity method investment is other
than temporary. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or inability of the investee to sustain the earnings capacity that
supports the carrying amount of the investment. If Gates determines that the decline in value of its investment is other than temporary, the carrying amount of the investment is written down to its fair value through net income.

 D. Foreign currency transactions and translation 
At an entity level, transactions denominated in currencies other than the entitys functional currency (foreign currencies) are translated into the
entitys functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Exchange
differences arising from changes in exchange rates are recognized in net income for the period. The aggregate foreign currency transaction gain included in operating income (loss) from continuing operations during Fiscal 2016 was $3.3 million,
compared with a loss of $4.0 million in Fiscal 2015, a loss of $9.2 million in Successor 2014 and a loss of $0.6 million in Predecessor 2014. We also recognized financing-related foreign currency transaction losses within other income
of $1.9 million during Fiscal 2016, compared with a gain of $62.7 million in Fiscal 2015, a gain of $63.9 million in Successor 2014 and a gain of $0.2 million in Predecessor 2014. 
On consolidation, the results of operations of entities whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the
weighted average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Currency translation differences are recognized within other comprehensive
income (OCI) as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. In the event that a foreign operation is sold, or substantially liquidated, the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to
the operation are reclassified to net income.  In the statement of cash flows, the cash flows of operations whose functional currency is other than the
U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the period.  E. Net sales 
Gates derives its net sales primarily from the sale of a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of
industrial and automotive applications, both in the aftermarket and first-fit channels, throughout the world.  Revenue from the sale of goods is measured
at the invoiced amount net of estimated returns, early settlement discounts, rebates and sales tax and is recognized only when: (i) there is persuasive evidence of a sales agreement, typically in the form of a written sale or purchase agreement
approved by both parties, (ii) the delivery of goods has occurredthis generally occurs upon passage of title which, depending on the arrangement with the customer, is typically upon release of the goods from the physical control of the Company
or upon receipt of the goods by the customer and, where there are contractual acceptance provisions, when the customer has accepted the goods (or the right to reject them has lapsed); (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) the
collectability of revenue is reasonably assured.  Where a customer has the right to return goods, future returns are estimated based on historical returns
profiles. Settlement discounts that may apply to unpaid invoices are estimated based on the settlement histories of the relevant customers. Rebates that may apply to issued invoices are estimated based on expected total qualifying sales to the
relevant customers.  F. Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Shipping and handling costs  Shipping and handling costs
billed to customers in relation to goods sold are included in net sales and the related costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. During Fiscal 2016, Gates continuing operations recognized shipping and handling costs
of $132.8 million, compared with $133.9 million in Fiscal 2015, $74.1 million in Successor 2014 and $76.0 million in Predecessor 2014.

 Research and development expenditure 
Research and development expenditure is charged to net income in the period in which it is incurred. Gates research and development expense for its
continuing operations was $68.5 million in Fiscal 2016, compared with $67.4 million in Fiscal 2015, $27.5 million in Successor 2014 and $26.3 million in Predecessor 2014. These costs primarily related to product development and
also to technology to reduce unit and operating costs.  G. Restructuring expenses 
Restructuring expenses are incurred in major projects undertaken to rationalize and improve the cost competitiveness of Gates. Restructuring costs incurred
during the periods presented are analyzed in note 16.  Liabilities in respect of termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily
terminated under the terms of a one-time benefit arrangement are recognized over the future service period when those employees are required to render services to the entity beyond the minimum retention
period. If employees are not required to render service until they are terminated or if they will not be retained to render service beyond 60 days or a longer legal notification period, the liability is recognized on the communication date. 
Termination benefits that are covered by a contract or an ongoing benefit arrangement are recognized when it is probable that employees will be entitled to
benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Benefits that are offered for a short period of time in exchange for voluntary termination are recognized when the employees accept the offer. 
Provisions for restructuring costs other than termination benefits are recognized only when the entity has a present obligation. 
H. Business combinations  A business combination is a
transaction or other event in which control is obtained of one or more businesses. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired business and, in a business combination achieved in stages, the fair value at the acquisition date of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business, over the
net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at the acquisition date. If the net identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business exceed the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired business and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previously held equity interest, that excess is recognized as a gain in net income. 
Consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and
equity instruments issued in exchange for control over the acquired business. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in net income.  Any non-controlling interests in the acquired business are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business are measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for certain items, including the
following, which are measured in accordance with the relevant accounting policy:   



 
pensions and other post-employment benefit arrangements; 
   F-16 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   




 
equity instruments related to the replacement of share-based compensation awarded to employees of the acquired business;   



 
deferred tax assets and liabilities of the acquired business; and   



 
assets classified as held for sale.  If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the
end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, Gates reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. If, within a maximum of one year after the acquisition date, new information is obtained about facts
and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date, adjustments are made prospectively to the amounts recognized, or new assets and liabilities recognized. Otherwise, any
adjustments to the provisional amounts are recognized in net income.  I. Goodwill 
Goodwill arising in a business combination is allocated to the reporting unit that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. 
Where a number of reporting units are acquired in a business combination, the goodwill attributable to each of them is determined by allocating the purchase
consideration in proportion to their respective business enterprise values and comparing the allocated purchase consideration with the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized but is
tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and is carried at cost less any recognized impairment. 
To identify a potential impairment of goodwill, the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is allocated is compared with its carrying amount,
including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired. 
If the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including the goodwill, exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to
measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The second step of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the
fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of its identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of the impairment test. An impairment loss is recognized if and to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its implied
fair value.  In testing goodwill for impairment, Gates calculates fair values using a weighted blend of income and market approaches. The income approach
is based on discounted future cash flows at the reporting unit level based on estimated future revenues and operating costs, which take into consideration factors such as existing backlog, expected future orders, supplier contracts and general
market conditions.  The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires estimates and assumptions at various points
during the analysis. Gates estimated future cash flows are based on assumptions that are consistent with its annual planning process and include estimates for revenue and operating margins and future economic and market conditions. Actual
future results may differ from those estimates.  We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but that are
unpredictable and inherently uncertain. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of Gates reporting units tested. Changes in

   F-17 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
assumptions or circumstances could result in an additional impairment in the period in which the change occurs and in future years. Factors that would impact the fair value estimates and could
cause us to recognize such impairment include, but are not limited to:   



 
decreases in revenues;   



 
increases in Gates borrowing rates or weighted average cost of capital;   



 
increases in Gates blended tax rate; or   



 
significant changes in its working capital requirements.  J. Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and any recognized impairment. 
(i) Assets acquired in business combinations  An
intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognized as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or other legal rights. 
An acquired intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which represents its fair value at the
date of acquisition, to net income over the Companys expectation of its useful life, as follows:   












 Customer relationships
  
 
16 to 17 years
 

 Technology
  
 
2 to 7 years
 
 Acquired brands and trade names are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are not amortized but are tested at least
annually for impairment and are carried at cost less any recognized impairment.  (ii) Computer software 
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized separately as an intangible asset. Computer software is
amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which ranges from 2 to 6 years.  K. Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognized impairment losses. Major improvements are capitalized.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance that do not significantly extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred.  Land and assets under
construction are not depreciated. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than land and assets under construction, is generally expensed on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Companys estimated useful
lives of items of property, plant and equipment are in the following ranges:   












 Buildings and long leasehold improvements
  
 
30 to 50 years
 

 Short leasehold improvements
  
  
Shorter of lease term or useful life
   

 Plant, equipment and vehicles
  
 
2 to 25 years

 L. Impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets 
Long-lived assets and intangible assets to be held and used, except intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment when events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
tested at least annually for impairment or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset, or definite lived intangible asset or asset group is considered to be
impaired when the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount. In that event, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its
fair value. Fair value is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. An impairment loss for an asset group is allocated to the long-lived
and intangible assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, with the limitation that the carrying amount of an individual asset is not reduced below its fair value. 
M. Inventory  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or net realizable value. A valuation adjustment is made to inventory for any excess, obsolete or slow moving items based on managements review of on-hand inventories compared with historical and
estimated future sales and usage profiles. Any consequent write down of inventory results in a new cost basis for inventory.  Cost represents the
expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition, which may include the cost of raw materials, direct labor costs, other direct costs and related production overheads. Cost is generally determined on a first in,
first out (FIFO) basis, but the cost of certain inventories is determined on a last in, first out (LIFO) basis. As of December 31, 2016, inventories whose cost was determined on a LIFO basis represented 35.5% of the
total carrying amount of inventories compared with 38.1% as of January 2, 2016.  N. Financial instruments 
(i) Cash and cash equivalents  Cash and cash equivalents
comprise cash on hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities on acquisition of 90 days or less. Our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents is managed such that there is no significant
concentration of credit risk in any one bank or other financial institution. Management monitors closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it holds deposits. 
(ii) Restricted cash  Restricted cash includes cash given
as collateral under letters of credit for insurance and regulatory purposes.  (iii) Trade accounts receivable 
Trade accounts receivable represent the amount of sales of goods to customers, net of discounts and rebates, for which payment has not been received, less an
allowance for doubtful accounts that is estimated based on factors such as the credit rating of the customer, historical trends, the current economic environment and other information.

 (iv) Debt 
Debt is initially measured at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs, if any, and is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the
effective interest rate method.  (v) Accounts payable 
Accounts payable represents the amount of invoices received from suppliers for purchases of goods and services and the amount of goods received but not
invoiced, for which payment has not been made.  (vi) Derivative financial instruments 
Gates uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements, primarily on
purchases of inventory. Gates uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate caps, to reduce its exposure to interest rate movements, primarily on the Term Loan debt. Gates does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or
trading purposes.  Gates recognizes all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the balance sheet date. The
accounting for the change in the fair value is recognized in net income unless designated in an effective cash flow or net investment hedging relationship. 
Please refer to note 14 within these financial statements and notes for a discussion of our policies for derivative financial instruments. 
(vii) Investments  Traded investments are classified as available-for-sale and are measured at fair value. Changes in their fair values are recognized in OCI and deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income except to the
extent that they represent an other than temporary impairment in which case the impairment is recognized in net income. In the event that such an investment is sold, the realized gain or loss is transferred from accumulated other comprehensive
income to net income.  (viii) Fair Value  Fair value
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value, or for which
fair values are presented in these consolidated financial statements, have been categorized into one of three levels to reflect the degree to which observable inputs are used in determining the fair values. Where a change in the determination of the
fair value of a financial asset or liability results in a transfer between the levels of the fair value hierarchy, Gates recognizes that transfer at the end of the reporting period. 
O. Post-retirement benefits  Post-retirement benefits
comprise pension benefits provided to employees and other benefits, mainly healthcare, provided to certain employees in North America.  Gates accounts for
its post-retirement benefit plans in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 715 Compensation  Retirement Benefits, which is based on the principle that the cost of providing these benefits is
recognized in net income over the service periods of the participating employees. 
   F-20 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 For defined contribution plans, the cost of providing the benefits represents Gates contributions to
the plans and is recognized in net income in the period in which the contributions fall due.  For defined benefit plans, the net obligation or surplus
arising from providing the benefits is recognized as a liability or an asset determined by actuarial valuations of each of the plans that are carried out annually by independent qualified actuaries on Gates balance sheet date. Benefit
obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method. Plan assets (if any) are measured at fair value. The net total for all plans in surplus is classified as a non-current asset. The net total for
all plans in deficit is classified as a non-current liability except to the extent of any excess of the benefits expected to be payable within one year over the fair value of the plan assets which is
classified as a current liability.  Gates recognizes in net income the net periodic benefit cost, which comprises the service cost, the interest cost, the
expected return on plan assets (if any), and the amortization of cumulative actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs.  The service cost
represents the present value of benefits attributed to services rendered by employees during the period.  The interest cost represents the increase in the
projected benefit obligation (which is the present value of accrued benefits including assumed future salary increases) due to the passage of time. The discount rate used reflects the rates available on high-quality fixed-income debt instruments at
the date of the plan valuation.  Prior service costs or credits resulting from plan amendments are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
income to net income on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of participating employees.  Actuarial gains and losses represent
differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets, gains and losses on the plan liabilities and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions. Gates uses the corridor approach whereby, to the extent that cumulative
actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the market related value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the fiscal year, they are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net
income over the average remaining service periods of participating employees.  Gains and losses on settlements and curtailments are recognized in net
income in the period in which the curtailment or settlement occurs.  P. Share-based compensation 
Share-based compensation has historically been provided to certain of our employees under share option, bonus and other share award plans. All share-award
plans are equity settled.  The awards granted during Successor 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 were made under plans operated by the Company, and
represent rights over its ordinary shares. The awards granted during the Predecessor period were made under plans operated by Pinafore Holdings B.V. and represented rights over its ordinary B shares. Gates recognizes a compensation
expense in respect of these plans that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula or a Monte-Carlo valuation model. 
For equity-settled awards, fair value is determined at the date of grant and reflects market performance conditions and all
non-vesting conditions. Fair value is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.

 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 Generally, the compensation expense for each separately vesting portion of the award is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the vesting period for that portion of the award. A compensation expense is recognized for awards containing performance conditions only to the extent that it is probable that those performance conditions will be met. 
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance
conditions.  An amount corresponding to the compensation expense is recognized in equity as additional paid in capital. 
A description of the plans in operation during the periods and the costs recognized by Gates in respect of those plans is presented in note 19 within these
financial statements and notes.  Q. Income taxes 
Current tax is the amount of tax payable or receivable in respect of the taxable net income for the period. Taxable income differs from financial reporting
income because it excludes items of income or expense recognized for financial reporting purposes that are either not taxable or deductible for tax purposes or are taxable or deductible in other periods. Current tax is calculated using tax rates
that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.  Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset and presented as a single amount only where a
right of offset exists and management intends to exercise that right.  Management assesses uncertain tax positions based upon an evaluation of the facts,
circumstances and information available at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for uncertain tax positions to the extent that the amounts previously taken or expected to be taken in tax returns exceeds the tax benefits that are recognized in
the consolidated financial statements in respect of the tax positions. A tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if management considers that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the relevant tax authority solely on the technical merits of the position and is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement assuming that the tax authority has full
knowledge of all relevant information. Provisions for uncertain tax positions are reviewed regularly and are adjusted to reflect events such as the expiration of limitation periods for assessing tax, guidance given by the tax authorities and court
decisions.  Interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are accrued in accordance with the applicable tax legislation on any excess of
the tax benefit claimed or expected to be claimed in a tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Interest and penalties are recognized as a component of income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated
statement of operations and accrued interest and penalties are included under the related taxes payable line in the consolidated balance sheet.  Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax basis. Deferred taxes are measured on the enacted rates expected to
apply to taxable income at the time the difference is anticipated to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized taking
into account the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies.  Deferred
tax is provided on taxable temporary differences arising on investments in foreign subsidiaries, except where we intend, and are able, to reinvest such amounts on a permanent basis.

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of the
difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax basis. Deferred taxes are measured on the enacted rates expected to apply to taxable income at the time the difference is anticipated to reverse. Deferred tax assets
are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized taking into account the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future
taxable income and tax planning strategies.  R. Assets held for sale and discontinued operations 
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business, the asset is available
for immediate sale in its present condition, management is committed to, and has initiated, a plan to sell the asset which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months, and the asset is being marketed for a reasonable
amount in relation to its fair value. An extension of the period required to complete the sale does not preclude the asset from being classified as held for sale, provided the delay was for reasons beyond Gates control and management remains
committed to its plan to sell the asset.  Assets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value
less costs to sell. Fair value is determined using the fair values of similar assets or the expected future cash flows from the asset or asset group concerned discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. Long-lived assets classified as
held for sale are no longer subject to depreciation.  Assets that are to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the
disposal occurs.  Gates periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term
objectives. As such, we may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations.  S. Use of estimates
 The preparation of consolidated financial statements under U.S. GAAP requires us to make assumptions and estimates concerning the future that
affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, the disclosure of contingencies that existed at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenue and expenses recognized during the accounting period. Estimates and
assumptions are particularly important in accounting for revenue-related items such as rebates, post-retirement benefits, impairment of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, income taxes, financial instruments, share-based compensation
and product warranties. Estimates and assumptions used are based on factors such as historical experience, the observance of trends in the industries in which Gates operates and information available from our customers and other outside sources. Due
to the inherent uncertainty involved in making assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes could differ from those assumptions and estimates.  3. Recent
accounting pronouncements not yet adopted  The following recent accounting pronouncements are relevant to Gates operations but have not yet been
adopted. Unless otherwise indicated, management has not yet completed its evaluation of the impact of the adoption of these pronouncements.

 ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued an ASU providing new guidance on the requirements for revenue recognition. The standard update provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. The five steps are: (1)
identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize
revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The ASU also sets out requirements to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue
and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about an entitys contracts with customers, significant judgments, and changes in those judgments, made in applying the
standard to such contracts, and any assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.  In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU 2016-08, which clarifies the principal versus agent treatment related to revenue recognition and in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies certain
performance obligation and licensing considerations related to revenue recognition. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which clarifies various issues identified by the Transition Resource Group. 
For public entities, all of the above ASUs are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that
reporting period.  To assess the impact of the new guidance and to implement identified changes, Gates has established a cross-functional implementation
team, which includes representatives from all of our business segments. We utilized a bottoms-up approach to analyze the impact of the new standard on our contracts with customers by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to
identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to revenues arising from such contracts. In addition, we are in the process of identifying the appropriate changes to our business processes, systems
and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the standard upon adoption.  While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new
standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be in relation to warranty reserves, primarily because of the identification of a separate performance obligation in relation to warranties offered or implied on certain products,
resulting in a reduction in the revenue recognized at the time of the sale.  We have completed our initial impact assessment, which is based on a review
of sample contracts representative of the range of our existing contracts. During the remainder of 2017, Gates will continue to finalize the initial impact assessment and design and implement changes to processes, systems and internal controls to be
in a position to report under the new accounting standard upon adoption in the first quarter of 2018.  The new guidance will be effective for Gates at the
beginning of 2018, and will supersede the current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard.
We currently anticipate adopting the standard at the beginning of 2018, using the modified retrospective method.

 ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments (Topic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  In January 2016, the FASB
issued an ASU which listed a number of improvements to GAAP in the area of financial instruments; specifically the fair value measurement of equity investments, impairment assessment of equity investments, and various other disclosure eliminations
as well as additional disclosure requirements.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Adoption of this ASU may impact the presentation in future consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)  In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which introduces a lessee model
that will bring most leases of property, plant and equipment onto the balance sheet. It requires a lessee to recognize a lease obligation (present value of future lease payments) and also a right of use asset for all leases, although
certain short-term leases are exempted from the standard. The ASU introduces two models for the subsequent measurement of the lease asset and liability, depending on whether the lease qualifies as a finance lease or an operating
lease. This distinction focuses on whether or not effective control of the asset is being transferred from the lessor to the lessee.  The ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard update, which will affect the recognition,
measurement and presentation of leases, is expected to be material given the number and value of leases held, but is still in the process of being evaluated. 
ASU 2016-09 Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-based Payment Accounting  In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that listed a number of changes relating to stock compensation;
specifically, the elimination of the tax windfall pool, simplifying forfeiture estimates and the treatment of windfalls on the statement of cash flows, and introducing practical expedients for estimates of award terms. 
The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this ASU will
simplify future tax measurement and presentation associated with our stock-based compensation plans but will not have any current impact.  ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  In
June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which broadens the information that an entity must consider when developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets. The financial asset must be measured at the net amount expected to be collected. 
The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact on our
consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard update, which may affect the recognition, measurement and presentation of financial assets, is still being evaluated. 
ASU 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments and ASU 2016-18 Statement of Cash Flows  Restricted Cash  In 2016, the FASB
issued two ASUs that clarify the operating, investing and financing cash flow classifications when receiving or paying cash in certain situations including debt prepayments, distributions from equity method investees and proceeds from settlement of
corporate-owned life insurance policies; as well as require the explanation of restricted cash movements for the period.

 In addition the new requirement states that an entity should include restricted cash in the cash and cash
equivalents line when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts in
the statement of cash flows.  The ASUs are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal
years. When adopted, the standard updates will likely affect the presentation of our cash flows in our consolidated financial statements and the impact is still being evaluated. 
ASU 2016-16 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-entity Transfers of Assets other than Inventory 
In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than
inventory when the transfer occurs.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those
fiscal years. The impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard update, which may affect the recognition, measurement and presentation of taxes, is still being evaluated. 
ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the definition of a business 
In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which better defines a business as having three elements; inputs, processes and outputs. 
The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact on our
consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard update, which may affect the recognition and measurement of entities acquired in the future, is still being evaluated. 
ASU 2017-04 Intangibles- Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment 
In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which eliminates step 2 of the Goodwill impairment test. 
The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. There is no impact expected on our consolidated financial
statements of adopting this standard update.  4. Acquisitions 
On July 3, 2014, Gates finalized its transaction with Blackstone for the purchase of all the equity interests in Pinafore Holdings B.V. for
$5.4 billion. The acquisition was financed through a combination of equity and debt, with Gates raising a total of $4.1 billion of debt, comprising secured term loans totaling $2.8 billion and senior unsecured notes totaling
$1.3 billion.  The following is Omaha Topco Ltds record of net assets acquired:

5. Segment information  A. Background 
ASC 280 Segment Reporting requires segment information provided in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the information that was
provided to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and in assessing the performance of each segment. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Gates serves as the chief operating
decision maker.  The segment information provided in these consolidated financial statements reflects the information that is used by the chief operating
decision maker for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and in assessing the performance of each segment. These decisions are based on net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).

 B. Operating Segments 
Gates manufactures a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications,
both in the aftermarket and first-fit channels, throughout the world.  During 2016 and 2017, Gates has been transitioning its operations to align around
its two primary product line businesses, Power Transmission and Fluid Power, including reorganizing the management team roles and responsibilities, introducing global product management functions, centralizing cost functions, implementing new
processes and systems, and changing internal reports presented to the chief operating decision maker to reflect this strategic re-focus on product lines. This change in the way in which the Company is managed
has necessitated a change in Gates reportable operating segments from regional segments to product line segments. This change became effective in the third quarter of 2017. As a consequence, all segment information in these consolidated
financial statements has been retrospectively recast for the periods presented.  Our reportable segments are now identified on the basis of our primary
product lines, as this is the basis on which information is now provided to the CEO for the purposes of allocating resources and assessing the performance of Gates businesses. Our operating and reporting segments are therefore Power
Transmission and Fluid Power.  C. Measure of segment profit or loss 
The CEO uses Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, to measure the profitability of each segment. Adjusted EBITDA is, therefore, the measure of segment profit or
loss presented in Gates segment disclosures.  EBITDA represents net income for the period before net finance costs, income taxes,
depreciation and amortization derived from financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before
specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. During the periods presented,
the specific items excluded from EBITDA in computing Adjusted EBITDA primarily included:   



 
the effect on cost of sales of the uplift to the carrying amount of inventory held by Gates at the date of the Acquisition;   



 
the non-cash compensation charge in relation to share-based compensation;   



 
transaction-related costs incurred in business combinations and major corporate transactions;   



 
impairments, comprising impairments of goodwill and significant impairments or write downs of other assets;   



 
net interest relating to post-retirement benefit obligations, significant lump-sum settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses; 
 



 
restructuring costs;   



 
the net gain or loss on disposals and on the exit of businesses; and   



 
fees paid to our private equity sponsor for monitoring, advisory and consulting services.

 D. Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA  continuing operations 
Segment asset information is not provided to the chief operating decision maker and therefore segment asset information has not been presented. Due to the
nature of Gates operations, cash generation and profitability are viewed as the key measures rather than an asset base measure.

Transaction-related costs are costs recognized in 2014 primarily in respect of the Acquisition, including advisory fees and change of control costs relating to
share-based compensation awards and the accelerated vesting of such awards.

During Fiscal 2016, Gates changed its accounting convention to expense maintenance, repair and operations assets below a nominal value threshold and also revised its
methods for estimating the write down for excess or obsolete raw materials and work in progress. These changes, totaling $17.7 million were made to bring consistency to our global inventory management. In Fiscal 2015, a similar adjustment of
$5.9 million was made in regard to the calculation of the write down for excess or obsolete finished goods.

This benefit relates to inventory sold during the second quarter of 2016 that had been previously impaired as part of a restructuring initiative. The initial
impairment was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA when it was recognized in 2015. For consistency, the recovery in the value of the inventory through its sale has therefore also been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, to the extent of the original impairment
recognized on the inventory sold.

Included in other income in Successor 2014 is a bridge financing commitment fee paid in connection with the Acquisition of $17.1 million.

 F. Information about major customers 
Gates has a significant concentration of sales in the U.S., which accounted for 38.5% of Gates net sales by destination from continuing operations during
Fiscal 2016, compared with 39.5% during Fiscal 2015, 39.3% during Successor 2014 and 38.5% during Predecessor 2014. As of December 31, 2016, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of Gates net sales. Two customers of our North
America businesses accounted for 20.9% and 13.1%, respectively, of our total trade accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2016,

compared with 22.1% and 13.0%, respectively, as of January 2, 2016. These concentrations are due to the extended payment terms common in the industry in which they operate.

$0.5 million expire between 2018 and 2026. After valuation allowances of $122.0 million, compared with $86.8 million as of January 2, 2016, we recognized no deferred tax asset in respect of these losses; 
 



 
Gates had foreign tax credits amounting to $134.9 million, compared with $125.3 million as of January 2, 2016, which expire between 2021 and 2026. We recognized no deferred tax asset in respect of
these tax credits; and   



 
Gates had other tax credits amounting to $43.8 million, compared with $55.7 million as of January 2, 2016, of which $28.9 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $14.9 million expire
between 2017 and 2034. We recognized a deferred tax asset of $31.5 million, compared with $41.8 million as of January 2, 2016, in respect of these tax credits. 
At December 31, 2016, income and withholding taxes in the various tax jurisdictions in which Gates operates have not been provided on approximately
$1,892.9 million of taxable temporary differences related to the investments in the Companys subsidiaries. These temporary differences represent the estimated excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in our investments in
those subsidiaries. These temporary differences, which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested, would become subject to income and withholding taxes in the various tax jurisdictions in which Gates operates if they were remitted to the Company.
The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability on the taxable temporary differences has not been determined because the hypothetical calculation is not practicable.

 6. Income taxes continued 
C. Uncertain tax positions  Unrecognized tax benefits
represent the difference between the tax benefits that we are able to recognize for financial reporting purposes and the tax benefits that we have recognized or expect to recognize in filed tax returns. As of December 31, 2016, Gates had
unrecognized tax benefits, net of competent authority and other offsets, of $56.5 million, compared with $54.3 million as of January 2, 2016, $61.5 million as of January 3, 2015 and $106.1 million as of July 2,
2014, which, if recognized, would affect our annual effective tax rate.  Changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

 Gates recognizes interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. As of December 31,
2016, Gates had accrued $11.7 million, compared with $9.0 million at January 2, 2016, for the payment of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. The increase in the accrual resulted principally from interest on existing
positions of which $2.7 million was recognized as income tax expense during Fiscal 2016, compared with $1.0 million in expense during Fiscal 2015, $0.4 million as a benefit during Successor 2014 and an expense of $5.5 million
during Predecessor 2014.  As of December 31, 2016, Gates unrecognized tax benefits consist primarily of tax positions related to transfer pricing in
multiple international jurisdictions and audits in various jurisdictions. We believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $2.6 million in Gates gross unrecognized tax benefits will occur in the next twelve months as a
result of the settlement of an audit or the expiration of the statutes of limitations in various international jurisdictions.  As of December 31,
2016, tax years 2011 to 2015 remain subject to examination in the United States and the tax years 2007 to 2015 remain subject to examination in other major foreign jurisdictions where Gates conducts business. 
State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after the filing of the respective return. The state impact
of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various state jurisdictions for a period of up to two years after the formal notification to states.

 7. Discontinued operations 
A. Gain (loss) on disposal of discontinued operations 
During Fiscal 2016, we recognized a net gain of $12.4 million, compared with $0 during Fiscal 2015, a loss of $2.3 million during Successor 2014 and
a loss of $0.1 million during Predecessor 2014, in relation to businesses disposed of in prior periods. The majority of this net gain related to the release of reserves for tax indemnifications made to buyers of businesses sold by Gates in
prior periods. These releases were triggered primarily by the lapsing of statutes of limitations on historical tax periods. The net losses incurred in Successor 2014 related primarily to the disposal of the Aquatic businesses in June 2014 described
below.  B. Loss from discontinued operations  During
June 2014, Gates distributed certain non-core assets to its indirect owners. The assets consisted of the Aquatic group of businesses, various parcels of vacant real estate and equity instruments from a legacy
business disposal. The Aquatic group of businesses, which formerly comprised the Aquatic operating segment, manufactures baths and whirlpools for the residential, and hotel and resort development markets, mainly in North America. The Aquatic group
and Gates real estate entities were accordingly reclassified as discontinued operations.  The loss from discontinued operations may be analyzed as

 8. Earnings (loss) per share 
Basic income (loss) per share represents net income (loss) divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income
(loss) per share considers the effect of potential shares, unless the inclusion of the potential shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. The treasury stock method is used to determine the potential dilutive shares resulting from assumed exercises
of equity related instruments.

 During Fiscal 2016, Gates changed its accounting convention to expense maintenance, repair and operations assets below a
nominal value threshold and also revised its methods for estimating the write down for excess or obsolete raw materials and work in progress. These changes, resulting in a reduction in inventory of $17.7 million and a corresponding increase in
cost of sales, were made to bring consistency to our global inventory management.  10. Investment in equity method investees 
Gates share of the earnings or losses of its investees is included in net income and Gates net investment in its investees is included within non-current assets. Gains and losses recognized on transactions with an investee are eliminated to the extent of Gates interest in the investee concerned.

these financial statements and notes. During Fiscal 2015, an impairment of $6.7 million was recognized in relation to plant and equipment in Gates South America as a result of the challenging market conditions in Brazil which have been
exacerbated by the significant devaluation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.  Property, plant and equipment includes assets held under

 As a result of the segment change discussed in note 5, the Company reallocated its goodwill to its new
reporting units, which are also its reporting segments.

 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 The Company conducts its annual impairment test on the goodwill balances as of the fiscal year end.
Management based the fair value calculations on a weighted blend of the income and market approaches. The income approach was based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent 2017 financial plans approved by the Board as of the testing
date, in which the principal assumptions were those regarding sales growth rates, selling prices and changes in direct costs. Forecasts for the following two years were based on region-specific growth assumptions determined by management, taking
into account strategic initiatives.  Cash flows for the years beyond this period for the reporting units to which individually significant amounts of
goodwill were allocated were projected to grow at compound annual growth rates reflecting annual decreases over the next seven years from the expected 2019 growth rates to the terminal growth rate. For Gates as a whole, this growth rate was 4.8%.
The terminal growth rate for all reporting units was set at 2.5%, a rate that does not exceed the expected long-term growth rates in the respective principal end markets. 
Management applied discount rates to the resulting cash flow projections that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks
specific to the reporting unit. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model. The discount rates used in the impairment tests were in a range of 10% to 13.5% for Fiscal 2016, compared with a range of 10.0% to
16.0% for Fiscal 2015.  For all reporting units, the fair values exceeded the carrying values and did not necessitate the second step of the impairment
test. No goodwill impairments were therefore recognized during Fiscal 2016 or Fiscal 2015.  13. Intangible assets

 During Fiscal 2016, an impairment of $2.0 million was recognized in relation to computer software, compared with
$0.1 million for Fiscal 2015, $0.6 million for Successor 2014 and $0 for Predecessor 2014. An impairment of $44.0 million on the brands and trade names was recognized during Fiscal 2015. Refer to note 15.C. for additional detail on
assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  During the Fiscal 2016, the amortization expense
recognized in continuing operations in respect of intangible assets was $149.5 million, compared with $165.6 million for Fiscal 2015, $87.6 million for Successor 2014 and $60.5 million for Predecessor 2014. In addition, movements
in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in a decrease of $48.0 million in Fiscal 2016, compared with a decrease of $107.1 million in Fiscal 2015, in the net carrying value of total intangible assets.

 14. Derivative financial instruments 
Gates is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, Gates uses derivative financial instruments, principally
foreign currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate caps (options), to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Gates does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes and monitors
closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it transacts.  Gates recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheet. Gates designates certain of its currency swaps as net investment hedges and designates its interest rate caps as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the designated derivative instrument is
recognized in OCI and reclassified into net income (loss) in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instrument representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current period net income (loss).  All other derivative instruments not designated in an
effective hedging relationship are considered economic hedges and their change in fair value is recognized in net income (loss) in each period.  The
following table sets out the fair value gain (loss) recognized in OCI in relation to the instruments designated as net investment hedging instruments:

 The closing fair value of the designated currency swaps as of December 31, 2016, was an asset of $0.5 million,
compared with a $11.6 million liability as of January 2, 2016.  During Fiscal 2016, there was a $7.0 million loss, compared with a
$18.4 million loss in Fiscal 2015, a $4.5 loss in Successor 2014 and a $0 in Predecessor 2014, recognized in OCI in relation to interest rate caps. In addition, $5.4 million in relation to the interest rate caps was reclassified from OCI
to net income (loss) during Fiscal 2016, compared with $0.7 million in Fiscal 2015, $0 in Successor 2014 and $0 in Predecessor 2014. The closing fair value of the interest rate caps as of December 31, 2016 was a liability of
$14.7 million, compared with liability of $15.5 million as of January 2, 2016.  Management does not designate its currency forward
contracts, which are used primarily in respect of material procurement, as hedging instruments for the purposes of hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815 Derivatives

 A. Currency derivatives 
As of December 31, 2016, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of
Gates cash was $24.9 million, compared with $50.8 million as of January 2, 2016, none of which have been designated as hedging instruments during the current period. As of December 31, 2016, the notional amount of
outstanding currency forward contracts that are used to manage operational foreign exchange exposures was $83.3 million, compared with $0 as of January 2, 2016, none of which have been designated as hedging instruments during the current
period. In addition, Gates held cross currency swaps that have been designated as net investment hedges. As of December 31, 2016, the notional principal amount of these contracts was $270.0 million, compared with $270.0 million as of
January 2, 2016.  B. Interest rate caps  Gates
uses interest rate caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of
variable rate payments from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for a premium. During 2016, Gates entered into two additional interest rate cap contracts. The first contract is for the period
June 30, 2017 through June 30, 2020 and has a notional amount of $0.2 billion. The second contract is for the period June 28, 2019 through June 30, 2020 and has a notional amount of $1.0 billion. Contracts with a
notional amount of $0.5 billion expired during Q3 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the notional amount of the contracts outstanding was $2.2 billion, compared with $1.5 billion as of January 2, 2016.

 15. Fair value measurement 
A. Fair value hierarchy  We account for certain assets and
liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the following hierarchy for the inputs that are used in fair value measurement: 
 



 
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   



 
Level 2 inputs are those other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  



 
Level 3 inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  Assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value are categorized in one of the three levels on the basis of the lowest-level input that is significant to its valuation. 
B. Financial assets and liabilities  The following table
summarizes financial assets and liabilities and their fair value as of December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016:

 Transfers between Levels of the Fair Value Hierarchy 
During the periods presented, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2, and Gates had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using Level 3 inputs. However, as described in note 18 of these financial statements and notes, certain of the assets held by Gates funded defined benefit pension plans are valued on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs. 
Valuation and methodology and key inputs  Certain
financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value, however; items such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, revolving credit facilities and bank overdrafts generally attract interest at floating rates and accordingly their
carrying amounts are considered to approximate fair value. Due to their short maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are also considered to approximate their fair values. 
Available-for-sale securities represent equity securities that are traded in
an active market and therefore are measured using quoted prices in an active market. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 above represent foreign currency exchange forward and swap contracts, and interest rate cap contracts.
 We value our foreign currency exchange derivatives using internal models consistent with those used by a market participant that maximize the use of
market observable inputs including forward prices for currencies.  We value our interest rate cap contracts using a widely accepted discounted cash flow
valuation methodology that reflects the contractual terms of each derivative, including the period to maturity. The methodology derives the fair values of the caps using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash
payments and the discounted expected variable receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation are based on an expectation of future interest rates
derived from observable market-based interest rate curves and implied volatilities. In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit enhancements to the contracts, are incorporated in the fair values to account for
potential non-performance risk.  To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit valuation
adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own non-performance risk and the respective counterpartys non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. 
Debt is comprised principally of borrowings under the secured credit facilities and the unsecured senior notes. Debt under the secured credit facilities
attract interest at floating rates, subject to a 1% LIBOR/EURIBOR floor and their principal amounts, derived from a market price, discounted for illiquidity, are considered to approximate fair value. Debt under the unsecured senior notes have fixed
interest rates, are traded between Qualified Institutional Buyers and their fair value is derived from quoted market prices.  C. Assets
measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis  Gates has
non-recurring fair value measurements related to certain assets, including goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment. 
Annual impairment tests are carried out on Gates brands and trade names, an indefinite-lived intangible asset, as of the Companys fiscal year end.
The fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation methodology in which the key assumptions included sales growth rates and an estimated royalty rate. Sales forecasts for 2017 were derived from the most recent financial plans
approved by the Board and forecasts for the following two years were 
   F-42 




Table of Contents

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
based on region-specific growth assumptions determined by management, taking into account strategic initiatives. The compound annual growth rates used reflect annual decreases over the next seven
years, from the expected 2019 growth rates to the terminal growth rate. For Gates as a whole, this growth rate was 4.8%. The terminal growth rate for all reporting units was set at 2.5%, a rate that does not exceed the expected long-term growth
rates in the respective principal end markets.  Management applied discount rates to the calculated royalty savings that reflect current market
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each region in which those royalty savings arose. In each case, the discount rate was determined using a capital asset pricing model adjusted for a premium to reflect the higher risk
specific to the nature of the intangible asset. The discount rates used in determining the fair value of the brands and trade names intangible were in a range of 11.0% to 16.5%. 
No impairment was recognized during Fiscal 2016, however, in Fiscal 2015, we recorded an impairment of $44.0 million in relation to the brands and trade
names intangible asset.  There were no other significant non-recurring fair value measurements in Fiscal 2016.

 Restructuring costs 
Gates has undertaken various restructuring activities to streamline its operations, consolidate and take advantage of available capacity and resources, and
ultimately achieve net cost reductions. Restructuring activities include efforts to integrate and rationalize our businesses and to relocate manufacturing operations to lower cost locations. A majority of the accrual for restructuring costs is
expected to be utilized during 2017.  Restructuring costs of $11.4 million were recognized in net income (loss) during Fiscal 2016 and costs of
$15.6 million were recognized during Fiscal 2015. In both periods, these costs related primarily to severance expenses incurred across all segments as part of the right-sizing of Gates operations
and the streamlining of our corporate functions.  During Successor 2014, restructuring costs amounting to $8.2 million were recognized in net income
(loss), of which $6.7 million related to the closure of the Ashe County plant in the U.S. During Predecessor 2014,

 Warranty reserves  An
accrual is made for warranty claims on various products depending on specific market expectations and the type of product. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims. The
majority of the warranty accruals are expected to be utilized during 2017, with the remainder estimated to be utilized within the next five years.  An
accrual is made for the cost of product recalls if management considers it probable that it will be necessary to recall a specific product and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

 Gates secured debt is jointly and severally, irrevocably and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of its
subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of their assets.  The carrying amount of debt has been reduced by debt issuance costs. These
costs are amortized to net income over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method. Included in the costs incurred on issuance of the debt in Successor 2014 are original issue discounts, totaling $61.6 million. As these
discounts reduced the cash actually received on draw-down of the debt, they did not give rise to a cash movement in the financing costs paid line of the statement of cash flows.

 Gates is subject to covenants, representations and warranties under certain of its debt facilities. During the periods covered
by these consolidated financial statements, we were in compliance with the applicable covenants. Also under the agreements governing our debt facilities, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making
certain investments and paying certain dividends is dependent, in part, on our ability to satisfy tests based on measures determined under those agreements.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 A. Bank loans 
Dollar and Euro Term Loans  Gates secured credit
facilities include a Dollar Term Loan credit facility and a Euro Term Loan credit facility that were drawn on July 3, 2014 to fund the Acquisition. The term loan credit facilities mature on July 3, 2021 and bear interest at a floating
rate, which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at Gates option LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. For the Dollar Term Loan, the interest rate was LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, plus a
margin of 3.25%. For the Euro Term Loan, the interest rate was LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, plus a margin of 3.25%. The next term loan interest rate reset date is on March 29, 2017. 
As of December 31, 2016, debt under both the Dollar Term Loan and Euro Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 4.25% per annum. 
Both term loans are subject to quarterly amortization payments of 0.25%, based on the original principal amount less certain prepayments with the balance
payable on maturity. During Fiscal 2016, Gates made $24.9 million and $2.2 million of amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan respectively. 
During Fiscal 2016, a transactional foreign exchange gain of $8.7 million, compared with a $23.6 million gain in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in
respect of the Euro Term Loan, of which $0, compared with a $31.0 million gain in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in other income and a $8.7 million gain, compared with a $7.4 million loss in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in OCI as a net
investment hedge of certain of Gates Euro investments.  Under the terms of the credit agreement, Gates is obliged to offer annually to the term loan
lenders, commencing in 2016, an excess cash flow amount as defined under the agreement, based on the preceding years final results. On March 11, 2016, based on the Fiscal 2015 results, we paid $35.3 million and
$2.9 million against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan, respectively. For Fiscal 2016, we do not anticipate being required to make any excess cash flow payment as our leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement has dropped
below the threshold above which payments are required.  As of December 31, 2016, the principal amount outstanding under the Dollar Term Loan was
$2,398.7 million and the Euro Term Loan was $201.6 million (192.8 million).  Revolving credit facility 
Gates also has a secured revolving credit facility, maturing on July 3, 2019, that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate
principal amount of $125.0 million, with a letter of credit sub-facility of $20.0 million. As of both December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, there were $0 drawings for cash under the
revolving credit facility and there were no letters of credit outstanding.  Debt under the revolving credit facility bears interest at a floating rate,
which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at Gates option LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. 
Unsecured senior notes  As of December 31, 2016,
Gates had outstanding $1,040.0 million Dollar Senior Notes and $245.7 million (235.0 million) Euro Senior Notes, which are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2022 (the Notes). The Notes were issued on June 26, 2014
and the cash was held in escrow until July 3, 2014, when they were applied as part of the funding of the Acquisition. The Dollar Senior Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 6% and the Euro Senior Notes carry an annual fixed interest
rate of 5.75%. Interest payments commenced on January 15, 2015 and are made semi-annually.

 During Fiscal 2016, a transactional foreign exchange gain of $10.6 million, compared with a
$28.0 million gain in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in respect of the Euro Senior Note, of which $0, compared with a $36.5 million gain in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in other income and a $10.6 million gain, compared with a
$8.5 million loss in Fiscal 2015, was recognized in OCI as a net investment hedge of certain of Gates Euro investments.  On and after
July 15, 2017, Gates may redeem the Notes, at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
redemption date:

 In the event of a change of control over the Company, each holder will have the right to require Gates to repurchase all of
such holders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, except to the extent that Gates has previously elected to redeem the Notes (under the
terms outlined above).  Asset-backed revolver  In
connection with the Acquisition, Gates entered into a revolving credit facility backed by certain of its assets in North America. The facility allows for loans of up to a maximum of $325.0 million, compared with $288.6 million as of
December 31, 2016, with a letter of credit sub-facility of $150 million within this. As of both December 31, 2016 and January 2, 2016, there were $0 drawings for cash under the asset-backed
revolver. Debt under the facility bears interest at a floating rate, which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at Gates option, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. The letters of credit
outstanding under the asset-backed revolver at December 31, 2016 amounted to $54.3 million, compared with $49.7 million as of January 2, 2016. 
B. Other debt  Other loans 
Other loans included loan notes that certain historical shareholders elected to receive as an alternative to cash in respect of all or part of the
consideration payable to them by the Predecessor in September 2010. The loan notes accrued interest at the higher of 0.8% below LIBOR and 0%. Although the loan notes were unsecured as part of the Acquisition, Gates was required to retain in an
escrow account the cash equivalent to the nominal amount of the outstanding loan notes.  During Fiscal 2015, payments of $1.4 million were made and a
favorable foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million was recognized. The loan notes fell due for repayment on December 31, 2015 and a further $2.9 million was settled on this date in respect of surrendered loan notes. A balance of
$1.8 million was outstanding as of January 2, 2016, which represented note holders who had not yet requested repayment of the notes. Funds for these outstanding notes were transferred into a designated account shortly thereafter, in full
and final settlement of the Companys obligations.

 18. Post-retirement benefits 
A. Defined contribution pension plans  Gates provides
defined contribution pension benefits in most of the countries in which it operates; in particular, the majority of its employees in the U.S. are entitled to such benefits. 
During Fiscal 2016, the expense recognized by Gates in respect of defined contribution pension plans was $17.7 million, compared with $18.2 million
in Fiscal 2015, $9.4 million in Successor 2014 and $10.9 million in Predecessor 2014.  B. Defined benefit pension plans 
Gates operates defined benefit pension plans in certain of the countries in which it operates, in particular, in the U.S. and U.K. Generally, the pension
benefits provided under these plans are based on pensionable salary and the period of service of the individual employees. Plan assets are held separately from those of Gates in funds that are under the control of trustees. All of the defined
benefit pension plans operated by Gates are closed to new entrants. In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, Gates has unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain current and former employees. 
Funded status  The net deficit recognized in respect of
defined benefit pension plans is presented in the balance sheet as follows:

 Gates desired investment objectives for pension plan assets include maintaining an adequate level of diversification to
reduce interest rate and market risk, and to provide adequate liquidity to meet immediate and future benefit payment requirements. Outside the U.S., Gates defined benefit pension plans target a mix of growth seeking assets, comprising
equities, and income generating assets, comprising government and corporate bonds, that is considered by the trustees to be appropriate in the circumstances. Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset allocations. 
Certain benefit obligations outside the U.S. are matched by insurance contracts. 
Investments in equities and fixed income securities are held in pooled investment funds that are managed by investment managers on a passive (or
index-tracking) basis. The trustees ensure that there is no significant concentration of credit risk in any one financial institution.  Plan
assets do not include any financial instruments issued by, any property occupied by, or other assets used by Gates.

 Investments in equities and bonds held in pooled investment funds are measured at the bid price quoted by the investment
managers, which reflect the quoted prices of the underlying securities. Insurance contracts are measured at their surrender value quoted by the insurers. Interest rate derivatives are valued by discounting the related cash flows using prevailing
market interest rates. Cash and cash equivalents largely attract floating interest rates.  Changes in the fair value of plan assets measured using
significant unobservable inputs (level 3) may be analyzed as follows:

 As of December 31, 2016, a cumulative loss before tax of $15.2 million, compared with a loss of $10.6 million
in Fiscal 2015, a loss of $13.1 million in Successor 2014 and a loss of $15.6 million in Predecessor 2014, relating to net actuarial losses, was recognized in accumulated OCI in respect of post-retirement benefits and had not yet been
recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost.  It is estimated that a net $0.4 million loss will be amortized from accumulated other
comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost during the period from January 1, 2017 through December 30, 2017.

 In determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider the relative weighting of plan assets, the historical
performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes, and economic and other indicators of future performance. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to
project long-term prospective returns.  C. Other defined benefit plans 
Gates provides other post-employment benefits, principally health and life insurance cover, on an unfunded basis to certain of its employees in the U.S. and
Canada.  Funded status  The deficit recognized in

A. Background  The Company operates a stock option plan
(the Omaha Options) over its shares to provide incentives to Gates senior executives and other eligible employees.  Prior to the
Acquisition, Pinafore Holdings B.V. operated a number of employee share plans, including variable options, replacement options, retention awards and annual bonus incentives.

 B. Description of the Successor plans 
On December 10, 2014, a new stock option plan was established by the Company for the benefit of senior executives of Gates and other eligible employees. A
total of 24,864,000 options were granted on inception of the 
   F-55 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
new option plan, with an effective grant date of December 10, 2014. The options are split equally into four tiers, each with specific vesting conditions. 
Tier I options vest evenly over five years from the grant date, subject to the participants continued employment by Gates on the vesting date. Tier II,
III and IV options vest on achievement of specified investment returns by Blackstone upon occurrence of a change of control event, which is subject to the participants continued employment by Gates on the vesting date. 
The performance conditions associated with Tiers II, III and IV must be achieved on or prior to July 3, 2022 in order for vesting to occur. All the Omaha
Options expire on January 9, 2025.  As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of the unvested options was $32.2 million. 
The fair value of the Omaha Options at their grant date was measured using a Black-Scholes valuation model, with a large number of sample simulations run for
Tiers II, III and IV. The fair values and relevant assumptions were as follows:

 C. Predecessor plans 
During Predecessor 2014, equitable adjustments were made to awards outstanding under the equity incentive plans to compensate for loss in value of the equity
interests due to the distribution of certain non-core assets to Gates indirect owners made as a condition precedent to the Acquisition. These adjustments took the form of cash compensation paid or
payable to those holders of the awards that did not share in the distribution. Cash of $5.9 million was paid as compensation to holders of the variable options and cash of $0.3 million was paid to the retention holders in Fiscal 2015. The
total paid and payable compensation has been recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses as an employee cost.  The specific adjustments
made in respect of each type of share-based award are detailed under the relevant heading below.  Description of the plans 
Predecessor Variable Options  The Predecessor Group
established an equity incentive plan under which certain of the Predecessor Groups executives were granted options to purchase B Shares, named the Predecessor Variable Options. During Fiscal 2016, Fiscal 2015, Successor 2014 and Predecessor
2014, the compensation expense recognized in relation to the 
   F-57

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
Predecessor Variable Options was $0 as all awards had fully vested by the end of 2013. The Predecessor Variable Options were fully settled in cash as part of the Acquisition. No Predecessor
Variable Options remained at December 31, 2016, January 2, 2016 or January 3, 2015.  No options were exercised during any of the periods
presented. In 2014, no options were granted and all predecessor variable options outstanding were settled in cash as part of the Acquisition. 
Replacement Options  Replacement Options over
17,640 B shares were granted to Predecessor Group participating executives. Each Replacement Option had a nominal exercise price and vested immediately on grant. As such, the Replacement Options had a fair value at their grant date that
was equal to the fair value of the vested awards under the plan that they replaced, which was the equivalent of the offer price of 325 pence per ordinary share in Tomkins plc. Accordingly, the fair value of the Replacement Options granted, which
amounted to $34.9 million, was recognized by the Predecessor Group as part of the consideration paid to acquire Tomkins plc and no further expense was recorded in the years presented. 
No Replacement Options were issued during the periods presented. These Replacement Options were settled in cash as part of the Acquisition and no Replacement
Options therefore remained at December 31, 2016, January 2, 2016 or January 3, 2015.  Retention Awards 
With regard to the Predecessor Group and following its acquisition of Tomkins plc, awards over 3,647 B Shares, named the Retention Awards, were granted to
certain executives. During Predecessor 2014, the compensation expense recognized in relation to the Retention Awards was $0.  Retention Awards were rights
to receive shares (or their cash equivalent at the sole discretion of the Predecessor Group) that normally become vested as to one-third of the award on the first three anniversaries of the grant date on
September 24, 2010 subject to the participants continuing employment by the Group at the vesting date (or, if not so employed, if the holder dies, has his or her employment terminated due to disability or without cause or resigns for good
reason). Vesting was to be accelerated in the event of a change of control or a liquidity event while the participant was still employed by the Predecessor Group. On the principal assumption that there would be no dividend payments during the
vesting period, the fair value on the grant date of the Retention Awards was $1,966.  The Retention Awards were settled in cash as part of the Acquisition
and no Retention Awards therefore remain at December 31, 2016, January 2, 2016 or January 3, 2015.  Movements in the number of retention
awards during the period may be analyzed as follows:

 Annual Bonus Incentive Plan (ABIP) 
Certain executives of the Predecessor participated in the ABIP under which each participant received a bonus that represented a percentage of the
bonusable profit of the business for which he or she had responsibility. Bonuses were determined based on bonusable profit for the calendar year. Interim payments were made quarterly in June, September and December based on 75% of
bonusable profit for the year to date and the balance of the bonus for the year was paid in March of the following year. Senior participants normally received their bonus as to four-sevenths in cash, one seventh in Bonus Shares and two-sevenths in Deferred Share Rights. Other participants normally received their bonus as to three-quarters in cash, one twelfth in Bonus Shares and one sixth in Deferred Share Rights. Bonus shares vested
immediately on grant. Dividends were paid on the Bonus Shares. Deferred awards did not vest until three years after the end of the quarter to which the bonus related, subject to the participants continued employment by the Predecessor Group at
the vesting date. If the participant ceased to be employed by the Group, the deferred awards vest, on a pro-rata basis. Dividends were not paid on the Deferred Share Rights until they had vested. 
In anticipation of the Acquisition, ABIP bonuses for 2014 were settled wholly in cash. 
Movements in the number of ABIP awards during the periods may be analyzed as follows:

 Just prior to closing the Acquisition, the 2014 ABIP award holders were compensated for their awards by the Predecessor Group
due to the change in control. This compensation represented the bonus for the 2014 period up until the Acquisition date. As a consequence of the Acquisition, all remaining ABIP awards vested according to the terms of the original grant due to the
change in control and were settled in cash.  The fair value of awards made under the ABIP was measured based on the internal valuations of the
Groups B Shares on the respective dates of the awards. The weighted average fair value of awards made under these plans during Predecessor 2014 was $3,072.50 per share. The compensation expense recognized during Predecessor 2014 in relation to
these awards was $10.9 million, which included an accelerated charge of $7.5 million due to the early vesting of Deferred Share Rights as a consequence of the Acquisition.

 22. Related party transactions 
A. Entities controlled by Blackstone (SUCCESSOR)  On
July 3, 2014, Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C. (BMP), an affiliate of Blackstone, entered into a management services agreement pursuant to which it provides Gates with consulting and other services in relation to the operations
of Gates including strategic planning, marketing and financial oversight. In consideration of these oversight services, Gates has agreed to pay BMP an annual fee of 1% of a covenant EBITDA measure defined under the agreements governing our Term
Loans and Senior Notes. During Fiscal 2016, Gates incurred $6.1 million, compared with $7.0 million in Fiscal 2015, in respect of these oversight services and
out-of-pocket expenses, of which there was no amount owing at either December 31, 2016 or January 2, 2016. During Successor 2014, Gates incurred
$3.1 million in respect of these oversight services and out-of-pocket expenses, of which there was no amount owing at January 3, 2015. 
Payments for such services will continue until the first to occur of (i) July 3, 2024, (ii) the date of a first underwritten public offering of
shares of the Company or any of its controlling holding companies on a national securities exchange (an IPO) and (iii) Blackstones stake in the Company becoming less than 10% and worth less than $25 million. 
Upon an IPO, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries will pay to BMP a milestone payment equal to the present value of all monitoring
fee payments that would otherwise have accrued and been payable through the earlier of (i) the 3rd anniversary of the date of the IPO and (ii) the tenth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition. At its option, BMP may choose to
defer receiving this milestone payment, in which event the monitoring payments may continue.  In addition, we have entered into a Support and Services
Agreement with BMP. Under this agreement, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries reimburse BMP for customary support services provided by Blackstones portfolio operations group to the Company at BMPs direction.
BMP will invoice the Company for such services based on the time spent by the relevant personnel providing such services during the applicable period and Blackstones allocated costs of such personnel. During the periods presented, no amounts
were paid or payable by Gates under this agreement. These services will continue until our Sponsor beneficially owns less than 10% of our ordinary shares and such shares have a fair market value of less than $25 million, or such earlier date as may
be chosen by BMP.  During Successor 2014, Blackstone provided certain services to the Company in connection with the acquisition including arranging and
negotiating the transaction and the funding for the transaction. In consideration for those services the Company paid BMP a fee of $51.5 million and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities Advisors LLC a fee of $5.3 million. 
During August 2014, Blackstone acquired an interest in Alliance Automotive Group (Alliance), a wholesale distributor of automotive parts in France
and the United Kingdom. Subsequent to this transaction, Gates had sales of $4.2 million to affiliates of Alliance during Successor 2014. Sales by Gates to affiliates of Alliance during Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 were $11.1 million and $20.0
million, respectively.  During the periods presented, Blackstone also held an interest in Optiv Inc., an entity that supplies Gates with certain
IT-related services. During Successor 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, Gates paid Optiv Inc. $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively. 
B. Entities controlled by the members of Pinafore Coöperatief U.A. (PREDECESSOR) 
Onex Partners Manager LP  On September 27, 2010, Onex
Partners Manager LP (Onex) entered into a management services agreement pursuant to which it provided Gates Acquisitions Limited, a subsidiary of Gates, with advisory, consulting and

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
other services in relation to the operations of Gates Acquisitions Limited and its subsidiaries including strategic planning, marketing and financial oversight. In consideration of these
oversight services, Gates Acquisitions Limited agreed to pay Onex (or such other party as is designated by Onex) a fee of $1.8 million per annum plus reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses. During Predecessor 2014, Gates Acquisitions Limited incurred $0.9 million in respect of these oversight services and out-of-pocket expenses.  It was further acknowledged and agreed that, from time
to time, Onex may be requested to provide consulting and other services to Gates Acquisitions Limited, including in relation to acquisitions and disposals or the sale of debt or equity interests in or any similar financing transactions. During
Predecessor 2014, there were no amounts payable in respect of such additional services.  As of July 3, 2014, Onex was no longer a related party to
Gates.  CPPIB Equity Investments Inc.  On
September 27, 2010, CPPIB Equity Investments Inc. (CPPIB) entered into a management services agreement pursuant to which it provided Gates Acquisitions Limited with advisory, consulting and other services in relation to the
operations of Gates Acquisitions Limited and its subsidiaries including strategic planning, marketing and financial oversight. In consideration of these oversight services, Gates Acquisitions Limited agreed to pay CPPIB (or such other party as is
designated by CPPIB) a fee of $1.2 million per annum plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. During Predecessor 2014, Gates Acquisitions Limited accrued and paid
$0.6 million in respect of these oversight services and out-of-pocket expenses. 
It was further acknowledged and agreed that, from time to time, CPPIB may be requested to provide consulting and other services to Gates Acquisitions Limited,
including in relation to acquisitions and disposals or the sale of debt or equity interests in or any similar financing transactions. During Predecessor 2014, there were no amounts payable in respect of such additional services. 
As of July 3, 2014, CPPIB was no longer a related party to Gates.

 No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments. 
B. Capital and other commitments  As of December 31,
2016, Gates had entered into contractual commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment amounting to $9.9 million, compared with $11.1 million as of January 2, 2016, and for the purchase of non-integral computer software amounting to $6.9 million, compared with $1.1 million as of January 2, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, Gates had entered into contractual commitments for non-capital items such as raw materials and supplies amounting to $14.3 million, compared with $7.9 million as of January 2, 2016. 
C. Letters of credit  As of December 31, 2016,
Gates revolving credit facilities of $450.0 million, compared with $450.0 million as of January 2, 2016, were undrawn for cash but there were letters of credit outstanding against the asset-backed

Notes to the consolidated financial statements (continued)   
 
revolving facility amounting to $54.3 million, compared with $49.7 million as of January 2, 2016. Also, Gates had outstanding performance bonds, letters of credit and bank
guarantees amounting to $3.2 million, compared with $24.1 million as of January 2, 2016, in addition to those outstanding under the asset-backed revolver. 
D. Companyowned life insurance policies  Gates is
the beneficiary of a number of corporate-owned life assurance policies against which it borrows from the relevant life assurance company. As of December 31, 2016, the surrender value of the policies was $906.3 million, compared with
$884.3 million as of January 2, 2016, and the amount outstanding on the related loans was $904.1 million, compared with $882.2 million as of January 2, 2016. For financial reporting purposes, these amounts are offset and the
net receivable of $2.2 million, compared with $2.1 million as of January 2, 2016, is included in other receivables.  24. Contingencies
 Gates is, from time to time, party to general legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Gates is also, from time
to time, party to legal proceedings and claims in respect of environmental obligations, product liability, intellectual property and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business and against which management believes Gates has
meritorious defenses available.  While it is not possible to quantify the financial impact or predict the outcome of all pending claims and litigation,
management does not anticipate that the outcome of any current proceedings or known claims, either individually or in aggregate, will materially affect Gates financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
25. Subsequent Events  During March and April 2017, Gates
completed several refinancing transactions to re-price the Euro Term Loans, extend the maturities of certain debt tranches and to raise additional debt to repay existing debt. In March 2017,
$150.0 million of new Dollar Senior Notes was raised and in April 2017 an additional 466.2 million was raised under the Euro Term Loan facility. The proceeds from these transactions were used in April 2017 to repay
$650.0 million of the existing Dollar Term Loan, keeping the refinancing transactions leverage neutral.  In June 2017, Gates finalized the purchase
of 100% of GTF Engineering and Services UK Limited, the owner of the majority of the net assets of Techflow Flexibles, for $36.7 million. Techflow Flexibles is a fully integrated engineering, manufacturing and commercial operation based in the
United Kingdom that specializes in high-pressure flexible hoses. With this acquisition, Gates portfolio of products now provides nearly complete coverage of high-performance land and off-shore oil and
gas applications.  In September 2017, Gates completed an annuity purchase for most of the retirees in its largest U.S. defined benefit pension
plan. The $154.0 million purchase price, funded from plan assets, settled $155.1 million of the pension benefit obligation. The net post-retirement benefit obligation has therefore reduced by $1.1 million. 
On October 2, 2017 Gates completed the acquisition of Atlas Hydraulics for 100 million Canadian dollars (approximately $80 million). Atlas
Hydraulics is a fully-integrated product engineering, manufacturing, and commercial business headquartered in Ontario, Canada. With locations in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, the company specializes in the design, manufacture, and supply of hydraulic
tube and hose assemblies.

 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
1. Background and basis of preparation  A. Background
 Omaha Topco Ltd. (the Company) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on May 12, 2014 by investment funds affiliated with The
Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone).  In these condensed consolidated financial statements, all references to Gates, the
Group, we, us, our refer, unless the context requires otherwise, to the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Gates manufactures a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications,
both in the aftermarkets and first-fit channels, throughout the world.  B. Accounting periods 
These condensed consolidated financial statements cover the 272 day period from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017, with comparative information
for the 272 day period from January 3, 2016 to October 1, 2016.  The Companys year end is the Saturday closest to December 31. 
C. Basis of preparation  The condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are presented in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. They contain all adjustments
(consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly the Companys financial position as of September 30, 2017 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2017 and
October 1, 2016. Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year.  These condensed
consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared on substantially the same basis as Gates audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2016. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 has been derived from those audited financial statements.  The accounting policies used in
preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those applied in the prior year, except for the adoption of the following new Accounting Standard Updates (ASU) at the beginning of 2017, all of which were
adopted using the method prescribed by the respective ASU:   



 
ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis 
 



 
ASU 2015-16 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments 
 



 
ASU 2016-09 Compensation  Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting 
 



 
ASU 2017-04 Intangibles  Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment 
In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2017-04 which
eliminates step 2 of the Goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment 
   F-73

test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting
units fair value (but the loss recognized may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit). The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. We have early adopted
this pronouncement on a prospective basis.  The above accounting updates have not had and we believe will not have a significant impact on Gates
consolidated financial statements.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2016, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, included elsewhere in this prospectus. 
2. Recently issued accounting pronouncements  Listed
within the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are accounting pronouncements that are relevant to Gates operations but which the Company has not yet adopted. The following new accounting pronouncements
issued in 2017, and updates to accounting pronouncements issued in previous years, are also relevant to Gates operations but have not yet been adopted. 
ASU 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the definition of a business 
In January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which better defines a business as having three elements: inputs, processes and outputs. 
The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.
We do not expect any impact on our consolidated financial statements from adopting this standard update, but it may affect the recognition and measurement of entities acquired in the future. 
ASU 2017-07 Compensation- Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic
Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost  In March 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which requires that an employer report the service
cost component of its net periodic pension and postretirement costs in the same line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the relevant employees during the period. The other components of net periodic benefit cost
(which include the interest cost, actual return on plan assets, and the amortization of any prior service cost or credit and prior actuarial gains or losses) are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost
component and outside of operating income. If a separate line item is used to present these other components of net periodic benefit cost, that line item must be appropriately described. If a separate line item is not used, an entity should disclose
the line item in the income statement in which these other components are included.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect the adoption of this standard update to affect the disclosure and presentation of our net periodic benefit costs, but we have not yet quantified the impact to our
financial statements.  ASU 2017-09 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting
 In May 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which clarifies when an entity should apply modification accounting by providing guidance on which changes to the
terms or conditions of a stock compensation award will require modification accounting. 
   F-74

 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
 The ASU is effective for all entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods,
beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in this standard update should be applied prospectively. We do not expect any impact on our consolidated financial statements of adopting this standard update, but it may affect the recognition
and measurement of stock compensation in the future should we modify our stock compensation plan.  ASU 2017-12
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities  In August 2017, the FASB issued an ASU
with the objective of improving the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entitys risk management activities in its financial statements. The amendments in ASU
2017-12 require an entity to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. The new approach no longer
separately measures and reports hedge ineffectiveness.  The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after issuance of ASU 2017-12. An entity should apply a cumulative-effect adjustment
related to eliminating the separate measurement of ineffectiveness to accumulated OCI and retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year that the entity adopts. The amended presentation and disclosure guidance is required only
prospectively. We expect the adoption of this standard update to affect the disclosure and presentation of our derivative and hedging activities, but we have not yet quantified the impact to our financial statements. 
ASU 2014-09 Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Revenue Recognition 
ASU 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ASU 2016-12 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  ASU 2017-13 Revenue
From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs  In May 2014, the FASB issued an ASU providing new guidance on the
requirements for revenue recognition. The standard update provides a single principles-based, five-step model to be applied to all contracts with customers. The five steps are: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the
performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
The ASU also sets out requirements to disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. These
disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about an entitys contracts with customers, significant judgments, and changes in those judgments, made in applying the standard to such contracts, and any assets recognized from the
costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer.  This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within that reporting period.  To assess the impact of the new guidance and to implement identified changes, Gates has established a cross
functional implementation team, which includes representatives from all of our business segments. We utilized a bottoms-up approach to analyze the impact of the new standard on our contracts with customers by
reviewing our 
   F-75 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
 
current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to revenues arising from such contracts. In
addition, we are in the process of identifying the appropriate changes to our business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the standard upon adoption. 
While we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the new standard, we currently believe the most significant impact will be in relation to warranty
reserves, primarily because of the identification of a separate performance obligation in relation to warranties offered or implied on certain products, resulting in a reduction in the revenue recognized at the time of the sale. 
We have completed our initial impact assessment, which is based on a review of sample contracts representative of the range of our existing contracts. During
the remainder of 2017, Gates will continue to finalize the initial impact assessment and design and implement changes to processes, systems and internal controls to be in a position to report under the new accounting standard upon adoption in the
first quarter of 2018.  The new guidance will be effective for Gates at the beginning of 2018, and will supersede the current revenue recognition
guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard. We currently anticipate adopting the standard at the beginning of
2018, using the modified retrospective method. We believe ASU 2017-13 will not have a material impact to our financial statements. 
ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842)  In February
2016, the FASB issued an ASU which introduces a lessee model that will bring most leases of property, plant and equipment onto the balance sheet. It requires a lessee to recognize a lease obligation (present value of future lease payments) and also
a right of use asset for all leases, although certain short-term leases are exempted from the standard. The ASU introduces two models for the subsequent measurement of the lease asset and liability, depending on whether the lease
qualifies as a finance lease or an operating lease. This distinction focuses on whether or not effective control of the asset is being transferred from the lessor to the lessee. 
The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The impact on our consolidated
financial statements of adopting this standard update, which will affect the recognition, measurement and presentation of leases, is expected to be material given the number and value of leases held. In 2017, we commenced our assessment of the
impacts on our business of this ASU but this assessment is not yet finalized and we continue to evaluate the impacts.  3. Acquisitions 
Description and financial effect of acquisitions  In June
2017, Gates purchased 100% of GTF Engineering and Services UK Limited, the owner of the majority of the net assets of Techflow Flexibles, for $36.7 million. Techflow Flexibles is a fully integrated engineering, manufacturing and commercial
operation based in the United Kingdom that specializes in high-pressure flexible hoses. With this acquisition, Gates portfolio of products now provides nearly complete coverage of high-performance land and
off-shore applications.  Gates incurred costs related to the acquisition of $1.5 million, which are all
included in the transaction-related costs line in the statement of operations.

 Provisional goodwill
  
$
17.5
 


  
  
  
 
 The provisional goodwill of $17.5 million arising from the acquisition relates largely to the expected enhancement to
Gates ability to make and supply long-length and large-diameter hoses, primarily for the oil & gas exploration and production industries. None of the provisional goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax
purposes.  The acquisition accounting for inventories, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and related tax balances had not been completed as
of the date of issue of these condensed consolidated financial statements and the values associated with the acquisition accounting are therefore still subject to change. Goodwill is accordingly provisional pending the finalization of the valuation
of these net assets.  Pro forma information has not been presented for this acquisition due to its size relative to Gates. 
4. Segment information  A. Background 
ASC 280 Segment Reporting requires segment information provided in the consolidated financial statements to reflect the information that was
provided to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and in assessing the performance of each segment. The chief executive officer (CEO) of Gates serves as the chief operating
decision maker.  The segment information provided in these consolidated financial statements reflects the information that is used by the chief operating
decision maker for the purposes of making decisions about allocating resources and in assessing the performance of each segment. These decisions are based on net sales and Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).

 B. Operating segments 
Gates manufactures a wide range of power transmission and fluid power products and components for a large variety of industrial and automotive applications,
both in the aftermarkets and first-fit channels, throughout the world.  During 2016 and 2017, Gates has been
transitioning its operations to align around its two primary product line businesses, Power Transmission and Fluid Power, including reorganizing the management team roles and responsibilities, introducing global product management functions,
centralizing cost functions, implementing new processes and systems, and changing internal reports presented to the chief operating decision maker to reflect this strategic re-focus on product lines. This
change in the way in which the Company is managed has necessitated a change in Gates reportable operating segments from regional segments to product line segments. This change became effective in the third quarter of 2017. As a consequence,
segment information in these financial statements has been presented on the new product line basis. Information for the nine months ended October 1, 2016 has been retrospectively recast to reflect this change. 
Our reportable segments are now identified on the basis of our primary product lines, as this is the basis on which information is now provided to the CEO for
the purposes of allocating resources and assessing the performance of Gates businesses. Our operating and reporting segments are therefore Power Transmission and Fluid Power. 
C. Measure of segment profit or loss  The CEO uses
Adjusted EBITDA, as defined below, to measure the profitability of each segment. Adjusted EBITDA is, therefore, the measure of segment profit or loss presented in Gates segment disclosures. 
EBITDA represents net income for the period before net finance costs, income taxes, depreciation and amortization derived from financial
information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses either year-over-year or with other businesses. During the
periods presented, the specific items excluded from EBITDA in computing Adjusted EBITDA primarily included:   



 
the non-cash compensation charge in relation to share-based compensation;   



 
transaction-related costs incurred in business combinations and major corporate transactions;   



 
impairments, comprising impairments of goodwill and significant impairments or write downs of other assets;   



 
net interest relating to post-retirement benefit obligations, significant lump-sum settlements and the amortization of prior period actuarial gains and losses; 
 



 
restructuring costs;   



 
the net gain or loss on disposals and on the exit of businesses; and   



 
fees paid to Blackstone for monitoring, advisory and consulting services.  Segment asset information is not
provided to the chief operating decision maker and therefore segment asset information has not been presented. Due to the nature of Gates operations, cash generation and profitability are viewed as the key measures rather than an asset base
measure.

 Transaction-related costs incurred during the first nine months of 2017 included $4.3 million related to
payments made on resolution of certain contingencies that affected the purchase price paid by Blackstone on acquiring Gates in July 2014 and $2.0 million related to professional fees incurred as part of the debt

This benefit relates to inventory sold during second quarter of 2016 that had been previously impaired as part of a restructuring initiative. The initial impairment
was excluded from Adjusted EBITDA when it was recognized in 2015. For consistency, the recovery in the value of the inventory through its sale has therefore also been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, to the extent of the original impairment recognized
on the inventory sold.  5. Restructuring initiatives 
Gates continues to undertake various restructuring activities to streamline its operations, consolidate and take advantage of available capacity and resources,
and ultimately achieve net cost reductions. Restructuring activities include efforts to integrate and rationalize Gates businesses and to relocate manufacturing operations to lower cost locations. A majority of the accrual for restructuring
costs is expected to be utilized during 2018.  Restructuring costs of $8.3 million were recognized during the nine months ended September 30,
2017, including $6.1 million in relation to severance costs, largely in the U.S., Europe and China. Restructuring costs of $8.0 million were recognized during the nine months ended October 1, 2016, including $7.3 million in
relation to severance costs, largely in North America and Europe.  Restructuring costs recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations
for each segment were as follows:

 6. Income taxes 
For interim income tax reporting Gates estimates its annual effective tax rate and applies this effective tax rate to its year to date pre-tax income. The tax effects of unusual or infrequently occurring items, including the effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are reported in the interim period in which they occur. 
For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company had income tax expense of $32.9 million on pre-tax
income of $85.3 million, resulting in an effective income tax rate of 38.6% compared with an income tax expense of $15.1 million on pre-tax income of $80.2 million, which resulted in an
effective income tax rate of 18.8% for the nine months ended October 1, 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 is primarily the result of our geographical mix of earnings, the buyout of one of the U.S. pension plans,
and changes in valuation allowances of $14.5 million. In fiscal year 2016 the company recognized tax benefits related to the release of uncertain tax positions, tax law changes, and non-taxable debt
forgiveness income of $5.5 million.  7. Earnings per share 
Basic income per share represents net income divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the fiscal year. Diluted income per share
considers the effect of potential shares, unless the inclusion of the potential shares would have an anti-dilutive effect. The treasury stock method is used to determine the potential dilutive shares resulting from assumed exercises of equity
related instruments.  The computation of net income per share is presented below:

 On June 12, 2017, Gates completed the acquisition of the Techflow businesses. Please see note 3 within these financial
statements and notes for more detail.  As discussed in note 4, the Companys segments were recast for a change that occurred in the third quarter of
2017. The impact of the segment change on goodwill was initially estimated as of July 1, 2017. The reallocation of goodwill was finalized based on the relative fair value of the reporting units as of September 30, 2017. As part of the finalization
of this allocation during September 2017, a reclassification of $7.2 million between the segments has been made.  10. Intangible assets

 11. Derivative financial instruments 
Gates is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. From time to time, Gates uses derivative financial instruments, principally
foreign currency swaps, forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate caps (options), to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Gates does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative purposes and monitors
closely the credit quality of the institutions with which it transacts.  Gates recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
condensed consolidated balance sheet. Gates designates certain of its currency swaps as net investment hedges and designates its interest rate caps as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the designated derivative
instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative instrument representing
either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current period net income.  All other
derivative instruments not designated in an effective hedging relationship are considered economic hedges and the change in their fair value is recognized in net income in each period. 
The following table sets out the fair value loss before tax recognized in OCI in relation to the instruments designated as net investment hedging instruments:

with a liability of $14.7 million as of December 31, 2016.  Management does not designate its currency forward contracts, which are used
primarily in respect of material procurement, as hedging instruments for the purposes of hedge accounting under ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a net loss of
$8.4 million, compared with a $1.8 million net loss for the prior year period, was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses on the fair valuation of these currency contracts.

 A. Currency derivatives 
As of September 30, 2017, the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts that are used to manage the currency profile of
Gates cash was $101.8 million, compared with $24.9 million as of December 31, 2016, none of which have been designated as hedging instruments during the periods presented. As of September 30, 2017, the notional amount of
outstanding currency forward contracts that are used to manage operational foreign exchange exposures was $94.1 million, compared with $83.3 as of December 31, 2016, none of which have been designated as hedging instruments during the
periods presented. In addition, Gates held cross currency swaps that have been designated as net investment hedges. As of September 30, 2017, the notional principal amount of these contracts was $270.0 million, compared with
$270.0 million as of December 31, 2016.  B. Interest rate caps 
Gates uses interest rate caps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest
rate movements. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate payments from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for a premium. During 2016, Gates entered
into two additional interest rate cap contracts. The first contract is for the period June 30, 2017 through June 30, 2020 and has a notional amount of $0.2 billion. The second contract is for the period June 28, 2019 through
June 30, 2020 and has a notional amount of $1.0 billion. Contracts with notional amounts of $0.5 billion expired during 2016. As of September 30, 2017, the notional amount of the contracts outstanding was $2.2 billion,
compared with $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016.  12. Fair value measurement 
A. Fair value hierarchy  We account for certain assets and
liabilities at fair value. ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures establishes the following hierarchy for the inputs that are used in fair value measurement: 
 



 
Level 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
   F-84 




Table of Contents


 Omaha Topco Ltd. 
Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 




 
Level 2 inputs are those other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  



 
Level 3 inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).  Assets and
liabilities that are measured at fair value are categorized in one of these three levels on the basis of the lowest-level input that is significant to its valuation. 
B. Financial instruments not held at fair value  Certain
financial assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value; however, items such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, revolving credit facilities and bank overdrafts generally attract interest at floating rates and accordingly their
carrying amounts are considered to approximate fair value. Due to their short maturities, the carrying amounts of accounts receivable and accounts payable are also considered to approximate their fair values. 
The carrying amount and fair value of Gates debt (other than bank overdrafts) is set out below:

 Debt is comprised principally of borrowings under the secured credit facilities and the unsecured senior notes. Debt under the
secured credit facilities pays interest at floating rates, subject to a 1% LIBOR floor on the Dollar Term Loan and a 0% EURIBOR floor on the Euro Term Loan. Their principal amounts, derived from a market price, discounted for illiquidity, are
considered to approximate fair value. Debt under the unsecured senior notes have fixed interest rates, are traded between Qualified Institutional Buyers and their fair value is derived from quoted market prices. 
C. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

 Available-for-sale securities represent equity
securities that are traded in an active market and therefore are measured using quoted prices in an active market. Derivative assets and liabilities included in Level 2 represent foreign currency exchange forward and swap contracts, and
interest rate cap contracts.

Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements (continued) 
 
 We value our foreign currency exchange derivatives using models consistent with those used by a market
participant that maximize the use of market observable inputs including forward prices for currencies.  We value our interest rate cap contracts using a
widely accepted discounted cash flow valuation methodology that reflects the contractual terms of each derivative, including the period to maturity. The methodology derives the fair values of the caps using the market standard methodology of netting
the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation are based on an
expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market-based interest rate curves and implied volatilities. In addition, credit valuation adjustments, which consider the impact of any credit enhancements to the contracts, are
incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk.  To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit valuation
adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. 
Transfers between Levels of the Fair Value Hierarchy 
During the periods presented, there were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2, and Gates had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis using Level 3 inputs.  D. Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
Gates has non-recurring fair value measurements related to certain assets, including goodwill, intangible assets, and
property, plant, and equipment. No significant impairment was recognized during either the nine months ended September 30, 2017 or October 1, 2016.

 Gates secured debt is jointly and severally, irrevocably and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by certain of its
subsidiaries and are secured by liens on substantially all of their assets.  The carrying amount of debt has been reduced by debt issuance costs. These
costs are amortized to net income over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.

 Gates is subject to covenants, representations and warranties under certain of its debt facilities. During the periods covered
by these condensed consolidated financial statements, we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants. Also under the agreements governing our debt facilities, our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional
indebtedness, making investments and paying dividends may be dependent, in part, on our ability to satisfy tests based on measures determined under those agreements.

facilities include a Dollar Term Loan credit facility and a Euro Term Loan credit facility that were drawn on July 3, 2014. These term loan facilities mature on March 31, 2024, and bear interest at a floating rate, which for U.S. dollar
debt can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin, or at Gates option, LIBOR plus an applicable margin. For the Dollar Term Loan the interest rate is currently LIBOR, subject to a floor of 1%, plus a
margin of 3.25% and as of September 30, 2017, debt under this Dollar Term Loan bore interest at a rate of 4.58% per annum. On April 7, 2017, the Euro Term Loan was repriced. As of September 30, 2017, Euro debt bore interest at
Euro LIBOR, subject to a floor of 0%, plus a margin of 3.50%. As of September 30, 2017, debt under this term loan bore interest at a rate of 3.50% per annum. The next term loan interest rate re-set
date is on December 29, 2017.  As part of the refinancing transaction, the maturity dates for both of the term loan facilities were extended from
July 3, 2021 to March 31, 2024, with a springing maturity of April 15, 2022 if more than $500 million of the Dollar Senior Notes remain in issue at that time. See the Refinancing section of this note for further
details.  Both term loans are subject to quarterly amortization payments of 0.25%, based on the original principal amount less certain prepayments with
the balance payable on maturity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017 Gates made quarterly amortization payments against the Dollar Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan of $15.0 million and $4.3 million, respectively. 
Under the terms of the credit agreement, Gates is obliged to offer annually to the term loan lenders, commencing in 2016, an excess cash flow
amount as defined under the agreement, based on the preceding years final results. Based on the Fiscal 2016 results, we did not need to make an excess cash flow payment as our leverage ratio as defined under the credit agreement has dropped
below the threshold above which payments are required.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a transactional foreign exchange loss of
$80.0 million, compared with a $6.2 million loss for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, was recognized in respect of the Euro Term Loan, of which $50.3 million, compared with $0 for the nine months ended October 1, 2016,
was recognized in other (expense) income and a $29.7 million loss, compared with a $6.2 million loss for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, was recognized in OCI in respect of the Euro Term Loan as part of this facility is
designated as a net investment hedge of certain of Gates Euro investments.  As of September 30, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under
the Dollar Term Loan was $1,733.7 million and the Euro Term Loan was $771.0 million (655.2 million).  Unsecured senior notes 
As of September 30, 2017, Gates had outstanding $1,190.0 million Dollar Senior Notes and $276.5 million (235.0 million) Euro Senior Notes
(the Notes). This includes $150 million of Dollar Senior Notes that were raised on March 30, 2017 as part of the broader refinancing transaction (see Refinancing section of this note for further details). The Notes
are scheduled to mature on July 15, 2022. The Dollar Senior Notes bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 6% and the Euro Senior Notes carry an annual fixed interest rate of 5.75%. Interest payments are made
bi-annually.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, a transactional foreign exchange loss of
$30.8 million, compared with a $7.4 million loss for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, was recognized in OCI in respect of the Euro Senior Note as this facility is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of Gates
Euro investments.

 In the event of a change of control over the Company, each holder will have the right to require Gates to repurchase all of
such holders Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase, except to the extent that Gates has previously elected to redeem the Notes (under the
terms outlined above).  Revolving credit facility 
Gates also has a secured revolving credit facility that provides for multi-currency revolving loans up to an aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million,
with a letter of credit sub-facility of $20.0 million. As of September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, there were $0 drawings for cash under the revolving credit facility and there were no
letters of credit outstanding. Debt under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at Gates option LIBOR, plus an
applicable margin.  Asset-backed revolver  Gates has
a revolving credit facility backed by certain of its assets in North America. The facility allows for loans of up to a maximum of $325.0 million, of which the maximum was $321.7 million as of September 30, 2017, and a letter of credit
sub-facility of $150.0 million within this. As of September 30, 2017, there were $0 drawings for cash under the asset-backed revolver, compared with $0 drawings as of December 31, 2016. Debt
under the facility bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin or, at Gates option, LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. The letters of credit outstanding under
the asset-backed revolver as of September 30, 2017 amounted to $57.0 million, compared with $54.3 million as of December 31, 2016. 
Refinancing  During March and April 2017, Gates completed
several refinancing transactions to re-price the Euro Term Loans, extend the maturities of certain debt tranches and to raise additional debt to repay existing debt. In March 2017, $150.0 million of new
Dollar Senior Notes was raised and, in April an additional 466.2 million was raised under the Euro Term Loan facility. The proceeds from these transactions were used in April 2017 to repay $650.0 million of the existing Dollar
Term Loan, keeping the refinancing transactions leverage neutral. A summary of the transactions and their effective closing dates are set out below:

 The majority of the costs related to the refinancing transactions will be deferred and amortized to net income over the
remaining term of the related debt using the effective interest method. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, $15.4 million of refinancing costs were deferred on the balance sheet. Those refinancing costs that do not qualify
for deferral are recognized in net income as they are incurred. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, $2.0 million of refinancing costs were recognized in net income as transaction-related costs. 
14. Post-retirement benefits  Gates operates defined
benefit pension plans in certain of the countries in which it operates, in particular, in the U.S. and U.K. All of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants. In addition to the funded defined benefit pension plans, Gates has
unfunded defined benefit obligations to certain current and former employees.  Gates also provides other post-retirement benefits, principally health and
life insurance coverage, on an unfunded basis to certain of its employees in the U.S. and Canada.  Net periodic benefit cost

 Contributions 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Gates contributed $6.3 million, compared with $7.1 million for the nine months ended
October 1, 2016, to its defined benefit pension plans and $3.8 million, compared with $4.6 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, to its other post-retirement benefit plans. For 2017 as a whole, Gates expects to
contribute approximately $7 million to its defined benefit pension plans and approximately $7 million to its other post-retirement benefit plans. 
Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income 
During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, $3.2 million of actuarial losses, compared with $0.4 million actuarial gains during the nine
months ended October 1, 2016, were reclassified from other comprehensive income to the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
Settlements  In September 2017, Gates completed an
annuity purchase for most of the retirees in its largest U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The $154.0 million purchase price, funded from plan assets, settled $155.1 million of the pension benefit obligation. The net post-retirement
benefit obligation has therefore reduced by $1.1 million. In connection with this transaction, a settlement gain of $3.9 million was recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost.

 17. Commitments and contingencies 
Gates is, from time to time, party to general legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Gates is also, from time to time,
party to legal proceedings and claims in respect of environmental obligations, product liability, intellectual property and other matters which arise in the ordinary course of business and against which management believes Gates has meritorious
defenses available.  While it is not possible to quantify the financial impact or predict the outcome of all pending claims and litigation, management
does not anticipate that the outcome of any current proceedings or known claims, either individually or in aggregate, will materially affect Gates financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

 18. Related party transactions 
A. Entities controlled by Blackstone  On July 3,
2014, Blackstone Management Partners L.L.C. (BMP), an affiliate of Blackstone, entered into a management services agreement pursuant to which it provides Gates with consulting and other services in relation to the operations of Gates
including strategic planning, marketing and financial oversight. In consideration of these oversight services, Gates has agreed to pay BMP an annual fee of 1% of a covenant EBITDA measure defined under the agreements governing our Term Loans and
Senior Notes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017 Gates incurred $4.5 million, compared with $4.5 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016, in respect of these oversight services and out-of-pocket expenses, of which there was no amount owing at either September 30, 2017 or October 1, 2016. 
Payments for such services will continue until the first to occur of (i) July 3, 2024, (ii) the date of a first underwritten public offering of
shares of the Company or any of its controlling holding companies on a national securities exchange (an IPO) and (iii) Blackstones stake in the Company becoming less than 10% and worth less than $25 million. 
Upon an IPO, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries will pay to BMP a milestone payment equal to the present value of all monitoring
fee payments that would otherwise have accrued and been payable through the earlier of (i) the 3rd anniversary of the date of the IPO and (ii) the tenth anniversary of the closing date of the Acquisition. At its option, BMP may choose to
defer receiving this milestone payment, in which event the monitoring payments may continue.  In addition, we have entered into a Support and Services
Agreement with BMP. Under this agreement, the Company and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries reimburse BMP for customary support services provided by Blackstones portfolio operations group to the Company at BMPs direction.
BMP will invoice the

Company for such services based on the time spent by the relevant personnel providing such services during the applicable period and Blackstones allocated costs of such personnel. During
the periods presented, no amounts were paid or outstanding under this agreement. These services will continue until our Sponsor beneficially owns less than 10% of our ordinary shares and such shares have a fair market value of less than
$25 million, or such earlier date as may be chosen by BMP.  During the periods presented, Blackstone held a controlling interest in Alliance
Automotive Group (Alliance), a wholesale distributor of automotive parts in France and the United Kingdom. Net sales by Gates to affiliates of Alliance during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $23.4 million compared
with $11.8 million for the nine months ended October 1, 2016.  B. Equity method investees

    ITEM 14. INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. 
We plan to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers to indemnify them to the maximum extent allowed
under applicable law. These agreements indemnify these individuals against certain costs, charges, losses, liabilities, damages and expenses incurred by such director or officer in the execution or discharge of his or her duties or the exercise of
his or her powers or otherwise in relation to or in connection with his or her duties, powers or office. These agreements do not indemnify our directors against any liability attaching to such individuals in connection with any negligence, default,
breach of duty or breach of trust in relation to the company of which he or she is a director, which would be rendered void under the Companies Act 2006. 
The Company also maintains directors and officers insurance to insure such persons against certain liabilities. 
In the underwriting agreement, the underwriters will agree to indemnify, under certain conditions, the Company, members of the Companys
board of directors, members of the executive management board and persons who control the Issuer within the meaning of the Securities Act against certain liabilities. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us
under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. 
The indemnification rights set forth above shall not be exclusive of any other right which an indemnified person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of our Articles, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.  ITEM 15. RECENT SALES OF
UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.  In connection with its formation in September 2017, the Registrant issued one ordinary share for $0.01 and
one redeemable preferred share for £50,000 to Blackstone Capital Partners (Cayman) VI L.P. in exchange for a 
   II-1 




Table of Contents

 
note due on April 2, 2018. The issuance of such shares of common stock was not registered under the Securities Act, because the shares were offered and sold in a transaction by the issuer not
involving any public offering exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.   In connection with the closing of
this offering, the Registrant expects to issue 245,474,605 ordinary shares in consideration for the ordinary shares and certain indebtedness of a newly formed holding company of Omaha Topco Ltd. and the pre-IPO owners will receive depositary
receipts representing such ordinary shares. Such securities will be issued in reliance on the exemption contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions by issuers not involving a public offering. No general solicitation or
underwriters will be involved in such issuances.   ITEM 16. EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES. 
(a) Exhibits. See the Exhibit Index immediately preceding the signature pages hereto, which is incorporated by reference as if
fully set forth herein.  (b) Financial Statement Schedules 
None  ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS 
 


(1)
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the
underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.   


(2)
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted
by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question of whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 
 


(3)
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:   


 
(A)
For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a
form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. 
 


 
(B)
For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the
securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
