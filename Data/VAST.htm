                               PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

    YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY TOGETHER WITH THE MORE DETAILED
INFORMATION REGARDING OUR COMPANY AND THE COMMON STOCK BEING SOLD IN THIS
OFFERING INCLUDING "RISK FACTORS" AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
RELATED NOTES APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

                                  Our Business

    We are a leading provider of web-based software products and services that
facilitate international buying and selling of goods by streamlining and
optimizing global trade processes. We call these products and services our
solutions. Global trade involves the shipment of goods between countries and the
management of information and business processes required to complete shipments.
Global trade is regulated by dynamic, country-specific rules and involves a
complex network of trade participants, namely exporters, forwarders, carriers,
brokers, importers, banks and customs and regulatory agencies. The core of our
solutions is our global trade content, which is our extensive on-line library of
country-specific rules and regulations that are needed to automate global trade
processes. Our web-based software applications utilize this content to improve
coordination and collaboration between the network of trade participants
required to complete international transactions. Our clients can subscribe to or
license our software products, use our transaction-based hosted service through
our Internet portal, TradePrism.com, or engage us to provide complete managed
services for part or all of their global trade operations.

    The Internet is enabling companies and individuals to expand their reach for
buying and selling goods around the world. While many companies have deployed
the technologies to streamline and automate business practices for their
domestic operations, many companies continue to inefficiently execute
international trade transactions due to paper-based business practices, a lack
of coordination among international trade participants and constantly changing
trade regulations. These inefficiencies are evidenced by a lack of information
and excess inventory in international supply chains, inaccurate duty payments
resulting in overpayments or fines or engaging in illegal trade.

    Most large companies maintain large and costly internal departments solely
to handle issues related to international trade. Companies that cannot justify
this cost often miss new opportunities entirely. Forrester Research estimates
that over 46% of Internet-based orders into the U.S. from international clients
go unfilled because companies lack the procedures to fill them.

    We provide comprehensive trade content covering countries that accounted for
approximately $4.1 trillion of global trade in 1999. We serve an international
client base of over 200 companies, including Dell, Ford, Lucent, Microsoft, the
New Zealand Dairy Board, Nike, Nortel and Sony. Our clients currently utilize
our solutions to ship to over 120 countries worldwide. We also provide
integrated solutions for specific industry segments, or vertical industries,
which are currently used by Internet trading exchanges such as CatalogCity.com,
Fasturn.com, RightFreight.com and SupplierMarket.com.

Recent Developments

    On July 14, 2000, we entered into an agreement to acquire Ford Motor
Company's global customs unit in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of our common
stock. Under the terms of our agreement, Ford merged its global customs unit,
consisting of personnel and technology used by Ford to manage its worldwide
trade, into our managed services operations.

                                       1
<PAGE>
    Under an agreement with Ford, we will manage Ford's global trade operations
including supporting Ford's import/export customs operations, administering
contracts between Ford and third party brokers and freight forwarders,
minimizing duties and customs fees for a minimum term of four years and a
maximum term of 10 years. As consideration for our software products and
services offerings, Ford has agreed to pay us based on certain minimum
transaction thresholds as well as a gain-sharing fee equal to a specified
percentage of the cost savings experienced by Ford under our agreement. We will
initially provide our product and service offerings to Ford in the United
States. Under our agreement, after successful implementation of our services in
the United States, we will commence providing our services to Ford divisions and
subsidiaries in other geographic regions around the world in a phased approach.
For a complete description of the Ford transaction, see "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Certain
Transactions--Transaction with Ford Motor Company."

<PAGE>
                                  RISK FACTORS

    THIS OFFERING AND YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE
OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISKS AND ALL OTHER
INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE PURCHASING OUR COMMON STOCK. IF
ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED, THE VALUE OF
OUR STOCK COULD DECLINE, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.

Our future success is uncertain and a component of our strategy may not be
successful because our web-based solutions are unproven, have only been recently
developed or are currently in development.

    We commercially released our web-based products and services known as our
TradeSphere solutions in February 2000. Our web-based portal, TradePrism.com,
was introduced in March 2000. Both TradeSphere and TradePrism.com are subject to
further development. Although prior to 2000 we derived substantially all of our
revenues from sales of our client-server based products, we expect, based on our
current strategy, to derive an increasingly higher percentage of revenues from
our web-based solutions in the immediate future. Because TradePrism.com and many
of our TradeSphere elements are in the early stages of development, there can be
no assurance that they will be successfully integrated into our solutions. Many
of these solutions require further product development to meet the needs of
companies engaging in global trade. If we fail to successfully complete this
development or if the market does not commercially accept our solutions once
they are fully developed, use of our solutions may decrease and our revenues
would be adversely impacted.

We have a history of losses and expect to incur losses in the future.

    Vastera incurred net losses of $9.3 million in 1997, $8.3 million in 1998,
$10.5 million in 1999 and $15.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000.
Our accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2000 was $82.8 million. Giving effect to
the acquisition of Ford's global customs unit, we incurred pro forma net losses
for the six months ended June 30, 2000 of approximately $34.4 million, and had a
pro forma accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2000 of approximately $82.8
million. We expect to continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future. We
expect those losses to increase significantly from current levels as we continue
to incur expenses to develop our products and services. We believe that the
success of our business depends on our ability to significantly increase revenue
and to limit our operating expenses. If our revenues fail to grow at anticipated
rates or our operating expenses increase without a corresponding increase in our
revenues, or we fail to adjust operating expense levels appropriately, we may
not be able to achieve and maintain profitability, which would increase the
possibility that the value of your investment will decline.

Our inability to successfully provide our managed services to existing and
future clients, including Ford with whom we have recently entered into a
significant contract, would significantly reduce our revenues, increase our
costs, hurt our reputation in our industry and adversely affect our business.

    As a critical element of our strategy, we intend to provide managed services
to our current and future clients. We plan to deliver services ranging from
providing operational management for a single global trade process to managing a
client's worldwide trade operation. We expect that the revenues we receive from
providing these services will increase

                                       5
<PAGE>
as a percentage of our revenues over time and represent a material portion of
our revenues. If we are not able to successfully provide these services to
existing or future clients, this strategy will have failed, and we will not
realize significant expected future revenues.

    Furthermore, we have established a contractual relationship with Ford under
which we acquired Ford's global trade operations and will provide Ford with our
managed services. See "Certain Transactions--Transaction with Ford Motor
Company" for a discussion of the material terms of this relationship. By
entering into this relationship, we expect Ford to become our single largest
client, generating a significant portion of our revenues. In 2000, we expect to
derive more than 10% of our revenues from Ford. Because the Ford contract is our
largest to date, we cannot assure you that we have adequate resources to meet
our obligations to Ford.

    Any inability to perform under our agreement with Ford or other agreements
with existing and future clients would significantly reduce our revenues,
increase our costs, hurt our reputation in our industry and adversely affect our
business.

The market for our recently developed web-based solutions is newly emerging and
dependent on the growth of the Internet, and if the Internet does not grow as
fast or is not as effective as we anticipate, clients may not use our products
and our revenues may decline.

    The market for our recently developed web-based solutions is newly emerging
and we cannot be certain that this market will continue to develop and grow or
that companies will choose to use our solutions rather than attempt to develop
alternative platforms and applications internally or through other means. The
anticipated growth of the global trade market may depend on the growth of the
Internet. Increased use of the Internet largely depends upon available Internet
security, bandwidth and reliability. If use of the Internet by businesses does
not increase as fast and is not as effective as we currently anticipate, the
market for our web-based solutions may not grow as we expect and our revenues
would be adversely affected.

Any restriction on our ability to cost effectively and legally access a foreign
country's rules and regulations that are incorporated into our global trade
content, Global eContent, or any failure to timely update Global eContent to
include changes in such rules and regulations, may compromise the effectiveness
of our solutions and adversely impact our revenues.

    The success of our global trade management solutions for our clients depends
on our ability to access the complex rules and regulations published by foreign
governments governing a particular country's import and export of goods. The
foundation of our solutions, Global eContent, is subject to rapid change at the
initiative of foreign governments, based on factors beyond our control. Any
changes in a country's rules and regulations relating to global trade that we
are unable to include in our Global eContent library may result in dissatisfied
clients and possible litigation. In addition, to the extent a foreign government
restricts our access to its rules and regulations, charges a fee for such access
or grants proprietary rights to such information to one or more of our
competitors, our solutions may not be useful to, or cost efficient for, our
current and future clients and our revenues could decrease.

Our services agreement with Ford is subject to termination for any reason by
either Ford or us after four years and, if it is terminated, we will not realize
the revenues expected to be generated thereunder.

    The services agreement between us and Ford has a 10-year term that may be
terminated by either party for any reason after four years. If the services
agreement is terminated prior to July 2010, we will not realize a material
amount of expected revenues expected to be

                                       6
<PAGE>
generated thereunder. Any events adversely affecting our relationship with Ford
may result in us not being able to achieve the full marketing benefit associated
with having Ford as a principal client, which would reduce our revenues,
increase our costs and hurt our reputation in our industry.

We have no operating history with Ford's global customs unit as our subsidiary,
and neither our historical results of operations nor our pro forma financial
information may be an accurate indicator of our future results or prospects.

    We have no operating history with Ford's global customs unit as our
subsidiary, which makes an evaluation of our business and prospects very
difficult. The pro forma financial information included in this prospectus is
based on the separate pre-acquisition financial information of Ford and us. As a
result, our historical results of operations and pro forma financial information
may not give you an accurate indication of our future results of operations or
our business prospects.

Fluctuations in our operating results and the composition of our revenues,
particularly compared to the expectations of market analysts and investors, may
lead to a reduced price of our common stock.

    Our operating results have varied in the past and could fluctuate
significantly in the future. For example, our revenues were approximately $5.4
million in the quarter ended September 30, 1999, approximately $4.6 million in
the quarter ended December 31, 1999 and approximately $6.3 million in the
quarter ended March 31, 2000. We expect that our operating results will continue
to vary in the future, based on a number of factors, including:

    - Demand for our products and services;

    - Increases in our operating expenses;

    - Competition in our industry;

    - Variability in the mix of our subscription and transaction revenues and
      our consulting revenues;

    - Timing of new solution introductions and enhancements to our TradeShpere
      and TradePrism.com solutions;

    - Seasonality in revenues due to variations in the number of holidays from
      quarter to quarter;

    - Continued business from our existing clients;

    - The loss of any key employees and timing of our new hires; and

    - Significant downturns in the U.S. and international economies.

    In addition, we have not yet experienced a consistent pattern of revenues
that will allow us to accurately predict the mix of revenues between our
operating segments.

    Due to the foregoing factors, our annual or quarterly results of operations
may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could
cause the price of our common stock to decline.

                                       7
<PAGE>
Our ability to achieve or maintain profitability will be constrained if we do
not effectively manage our rapid growth.

    We have significantly increased our employee base to meet increasing demand
for our client solutions. The number of our employees has increased from 104 as
of December 31, 1998 to 234 as of June 30, 2000. With the acquisition of Ford's
global customs unit, we acquired or have access to a number of Ford's employees.
As we expand our operations, we expect to continue to increase the size of our
employee base. Our management and operations have been strained by this growth
and will continue to be strained by our anticipated growth. To compete
effectively and to manage future growth, we must continue to improve our
financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures on a timely
basis. We must also expand, train and manage our employee base. If we are not
successful in managing our growth, our ability to achieve or maintain
profitability may be harmed.

If several key new members of our management team do not work together
successfully, a component of our growth strategy will have failed.

    Some members of our current management team have been in place for only a
relatively short period of time. Our Chief Operating Officer, Senior Vice
President of Worldwide Sales, Senior Vice President of Global Services and Vice
President of Marketing all joined us within the last year. Accordingly, each of
these individuals has limited experience with our company. Our new executive
officers may not be able to integrate themselves into our daily operations and
to work effectively as a team, which could impair our ability to implement our
growth strategy.

We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, which would adversely
affect our ability to develop and effectively manage our business.

    Our future performance will depend largely on the efforts and abilities of
our senior executives, key technical, professional services, sales and marketing
and managerial personnel. This dependence is particular to our business because
personal relationships are a critical element of obtaining and maintaining
clients. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain these key
employees in the future. The employment of our key personnel, including our
executives, is at will. The market for such persons is extremely competitive and
we may not find qualified replacements for personnel who leave us. In the past,
we have experienced difficulty in hiring qualified technical, professional
services, sales, marketing and managerial personnel. In addition, we do not
maintain key person life insurance on any of our key personnel, and have no
plans to do so. The loss of, or the inability to attract, any one or more of our
key personnel may harm our ability to develop and effectively manage our
business.

If we are unable to obtain additional capital as needed or obtain additional
capital on unfavorable terms in the future, our operations and growth strategy
may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock could
decline.

    We have historically financed our operations primarily through the sale of
our securities. As of June 30, 2000, we had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $374,000 plus short term investments of approximately
$8.7 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $82.8 million. While we
believe that the net proceeds from this offering, combined with current cash
resources, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital
expenditures for at least twelve months, we may need to raise additional debt or
equity capital to fund the expansion of our operations, to enhance our products
and services, or to acquire or invest in

                                       8
<PAGE>
complementary products, services, businesses or technologies. If we raise
additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt or
equity securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution,
and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and
privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock, including shares of
common stock sold in the offering. Any debt financing secured by us in the
future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising
activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business
opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able
to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If adequate
funds are not available on terms favorable to us, our operations and growth
strategy may be adversely affected and the market price for our common stock
could decline.

Our international operations and planned expansion expose us to business risks
that could limit the effectiveness of our growth strategy and cause our
operating results to suffer.

    We intend to expand substantially our international operations and enter new
international markets, including providing our services to divisions and
subsidiaries of Ford operating in foreign countries. This expansion will require
significant management attention and financial resources to successfully
translate our software products into various languages, to develop compliance
expertise relating to international regulatory agencies and to develop direct
and indirect international sales and support channels. We face a number of risks
associated with conducting our business internationally that could negatively
impact our operating results, including:

    - language barriers, conflicting international business practices and other
      difficulties relating to the management and administration of a global
      business;

    - longer sales cycles associated with educating foreign clients about the
      benefits of our products and services;

    - currency fluctuations and exchange rates;

    - multiple and possibly overlapping tax structures and the burdens of
      complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;

    - the need to consider characteristics unique to technology systems used
      internationally; and

    - economic or political instability in some international markets.

    We may not succeed in our efforts to enter new international markets,
establish, maintain or increase international demand for our solutions or expand
our international operations, which may harm our growth strategy and could cause
our operating results to suffer.

We may be unable to sell our web-based solutions if our target clients do not
accept our subscription and transaction-based pricing model.

    Our new subscription and transaction-based pricing model for our web-based
solutions is untested and will require our clients to make recurring
subscription and transaction fee payments instead of a one-time capital
investment followed by the payment of fees for maintenance and support. If our
current and future clients do not accept our pricing model, our sales could
suffer.

                                       9
<PAGE>
Our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict when
or if sales will occur and therefore we may experience an unplanned shortfall in
revenues.

    Our products have a lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle that contributes
to the uncertainty of our operating results. Clients typically view the purchase
of our solutions as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, clients
generally evaluate our solutions and determine their impact on existing
infrastructure over a lengthy period of time. Our sales cycle has averaged
approximately six to nine months, depending on a particular client's
implementation requirements and whether the client is new or is extending an
existing implementation. The license of our software products may be subject to
delays if the client has lengthy internal budgeting, approval and evaluation
processes. We may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a
client's evaluation period, including the costs of developing a full proposal
and completing a rapid proof of concept or custom demonstration, before the
client engages us. Larger clients may purchase our solutions as a part of
multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions, which may result in additional
unplanned administrative processing and other delays. If revenues forecasted
from a specific client for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed
to another quarter, we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues, which
could adversely affect our operating results.

Any loss of our strategic alliances or failure to develop new relationships
would reduce our revenues.

    We have established strategic alliances with a number of third parties
including Andersen Consulting, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Microsoft, Baan, i2
Technologies, JD Edwards, Oracle, RightFreight.com, SAP and SupplierMarket.com.
See "Business--Strategic Alliances" for a discussion of the material terms of
these relationships. We depend on these relationships for our worldwide
implementation, integration, development and promotion of our solutions. We also
expect these relationships to provide us with marketing and sales opportunities.
If we are unable to maintain successfully our existing relationships or develop
new relationships, our revenues may be reduced.

Any loss of our licensed third-party technology may result in increased costs of
or delays in providing our solutions, which would harm our operating results.

    We license technology from several companies on a non-exclusive basis that
is integrated into our TradeSphere product suite, including development tools
and facilities from IBM (WebSphere and MQ Series) and Forte, which was acquired
by Sun Microsystems. We anticipate that we will continue to license technology
from these and other third parties in the future. This software may not continue
to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. While the term of
our license with Sun Microsystems expires on December 23, 2002, and our license
with IBM expires on June 30, 2006, these licenses would be difficult and
time-consuming to replace. The loss of any of these technology licenses could
result in delays in the licensing of our TradeSphere products until equivalent
technology, if available, is identified, licensed and integrated, and would
adversely affect our operating results.

The dynamic and complex nature of Global eContent increases the likelihood that
we may face costly product liability claims.

    The foundation of our software solutions and managed services, Global
eContent, consists of the complex and continually changing country-specific
rules and regulations published by foreign governments in connection with the
import and export of goods. Because of the dynamic and complex nature of Global
eContent, we may face product liability claims in connection with our current
products and future products. Any provisions in our

                                       10
<PAGE>
agreements with our clients designed to limit our exposure to potential product
liability claims and any product liability insurance may not be adequate to
protect us from such claims under our agreements. A successful product liability
claim brought against us could harm our financial condition. Even if
unsuccessful, any product liability claim could result in costly litigation and
divert management's attention and resources. In addition, the effective
implementation of our products may depend upon the successful operation of
third-party licensed products in conjunction with our products, and therefore
any undetected errors in these licensed products may prevent the implementation
or impair the functionality of our products, delay new product introductions and
injure our reputation.

The uncertainty of future government regulation of the Internet and global trade
may add to our operating costs.

    We may face unanticipated operating costs because of the current uncertainty
surrounding potential government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce. We
believe that we are not currently subject to direct regulation of online
commerce, other than regulations applicable to businesses generally. However,
the Internet has rapidly emerged as a commerce medium, and governmental agencies
have not yet been able to adapt all existing regulations to the Internet
environment. Laws and regulations may be introduced and court decisions reached
that affect the Internet or other online services, covering issues such as user
pricing, user privacy, freedom of expression, access charges, content and
quality of products and services, advertising, intellectual property rights and
information security. As an Internet company, it is unclear in which
jurisdictions we are actually conducting business. Our failure to qualify to do
business in a jurisdiction that requires us to do so could subject us to fines
or penalties and could result in our inability to enforce contracts in that
jurisdiction. Even if we were able to ascertain correctly in which jurisdictions
we conduct business, many of these jurisdictions have yet to determine the
application of their existing laws to web-based global trade or develop laws
that apply to such trade. Complying with new regulation would increase our
operating costs.

We may be unable to expand the import and export trade management services
provided to Ford into other geographic regions and other product lines in the
manner anticipated.

    Under our agreement, we are providing Ford with import and export trade
management services in a phased in geographical approach, starting with the
United States. If we are unable to perform the services provided in the United
States in accordance with our mutually agreed upon performance criteria, Ford
may not incorporate our services into many of Ford's operations in other
geographic regions and product lines, which would reduce our future revenue
growth. Additionally, in the past Ford may not have complied fully with all of
the regulatory requirements established by foreign governments, which may impede
our ability to establish and leverage our operations under the Ford agreements
in other geographic regions and which in turn would reduce our future revenue
growth. Any failure to receive the requisite government approvals in connection
with providing Ford managed services would adversely impact our operating
results.

We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which could
result in their unauthorized use by our competitors and have an adverse impact
on our revenues.

    Our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We
rely primarily on:

    - Copyright, trade secret and trademark laws;

    - Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties; and

                                       11
<PAGE>
    - Protective contractual provisions such as those contained in license
      agreements with consultants, vendors and clients, although we have not
      signed such agreements in every case.

    Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties
may copy aspects of our products and obtain and use information we regard as
proprietary. Other parties may breach confidentiality agreements and other
protective contracts. We may not become aware of these breaches or have adequate
remedies available. We may need to litigate claims against third parties who
infringe our intellectual property rights, which could be costly.

    We have not secured registration of all our marks in the United States and
have not pursued registration of our intellectual property in any foreign
country. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary
rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Effective
copyright, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in other
jurisdictions. If we cannot adequately protect our proprietary rights, our
competitors could benefit from the unauthorized use of such rights, resulting in
an adverse impact on our revenues. Even if we are able to protect our
proprietary rights, we could incur significant costs to defend our rights.

Our patent protection strategy is in development currently and any inadequacy in
the protection of our technology could increase our operating costs.

    We may also rely on patents to protect our proprietary rights in the future.
Any patent strategy we attempt to implement may not be successful and could harm
our business by disclosing unpatentable trade secrets. The laws that apply to
the types of patents we may seek are evolving and are subject to change. We
presently have filed provisional patent applications in the United States. These
applications may not result in patents or may take longer than we expect to
result in patents. We may also decide to not file patent applications in all the
countries in which we operate or intend to operate. Our decision to do so may
inhibit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in those countries. Even
if we are issued patents, we cannot assure you that they will provide us any
meaningful protection or competitive advantage. If we try to enforce our
patents, third parties may challenge our patents in court or before the United
States Patent and Trademark Office. An unfavorable outcome in any such
proceeding could require us to cease using the technology or to license rights
from prevailing third parties. There is no guarantee that any prevailing party
would offer us a license or that we could acquire any license made available to
us on commercially acceptable terms. Developing and enforcing our patent
protection strategy may increase our operating costs.

We may have to defend against intellectual property infringement claims, which
could be expensive and, if we are not successful, could disrupt our business.

    We cannot be certain that our tools or solutions do not or will not infringe
valid patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights held
by third parties. As a result, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims
from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the
ordinary course of our business.


    For example, at least one firm has asserted that it is about to obtain a
broad patent that might read on the entire area of international trade
calculations or a large portion of commerce related to the use of computers in
international trade. An assessment of our risk related to this patent cannot be
made until such patent is issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If and
when such patent is issued, we believe we will then be able to


                                       12
<PAGE>

determine the technology and business processes covered by it and its possible
applicability to our business. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject
to lawsuits or other demands arising out of this or any other patents that may
exist now or in the future. See "Business--Intellectual Property and Other
Proprietary Rights" on page 52.


    We may incur substantial expenses in defending against any third-party
infringement claims, regardless of their merit. Successful infringement claims
against us may result in substantial monetary liability or may disrupt our
business.

Competition in our market could make it difficult to attract clients, cause us
to reduce prices, resulting in reduced gross margins, or cause us to fail to
gain market share or experience a loss of market share, any of which could
reduce our operating results.

    The market for our products and services is competitive, dynamic and subject
to frequent technological changes. The intensity of competition and the pace of
change are expected to increase in the future. Our solutions face competition
from a number of competitors offering products and services that vary in
functionality including:

    - Content aggregators such as Dun & Bradstreet and TradeCompass;

    - International trade logistics providers such as Capstan, Nextlink and
      ClearCross;

    - Trade consultants such as management consulting firms, law firms and
      boutique consulting firms; and

    - Outsourcing service providers, such as third party logistics providers,
      fourth party logistics providers and carriers.

    We expect additional competition from other established and emerging
companies as the market for global trade solutions evolves. Current or future
competitors may develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to
ours at a lower price, which could harm our revenues and profitability.
Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced gross margins,
loss of market share or failure to gain market share, any of which would
seriously harm our business. We may not be able to compete successfully against
current and future competitors, which may reduce our operating results and lower
the value of your investment in our common stock.

Any future acquisitions may be difficult and disruptive, we may not realize the
expected benefits from any such acquisitions and our operating results may be
harmed if we cannot address the challenges presented by acquisitions.

    In the past we have acquired businesses to expand our operations or market
presence and intend to continue our expansion by acquiring or investing in
companies, assets or technologies that complement our business and offer
opportunities for growth. These transactions involve many risks and challenges
that we might not successfully overcome, including:

    - Difficulties in assimilating technologies, products, personnel and
      operations;

    - Disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management's attention
      from other business concerns;

    - Risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;

    - Issuances of equity securities that may dilute your ownership interest in
      our common stock;

                                       13
<PAGE>
    - Cash payments to or the assumption of debt or other liabilities of the
      companies we acquire; and

    - Large write-offs and amortization expenses related to goodwill and other
      intangible assets.

    Our inability to address these risks could negatively impact our operating
results. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of Ford's global
customs unit, we acquired, or are receiving full-time services from, a number of
Ford employees. Any failure to successfully integrate these employees into our
operations will increase our operating expenses and may adversely impact our
revenues. Moreover, any future acquisitions or investments, even if successfully
completed, may not generate any additional revenue or provide any benefit to our
business.

Shares of common stock eligible for public sale after this offering could
depress our stock price.

    The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by
our existing stockholders of shares of common stock in the market after this
offering, or the perception that these sales could occur. Approximately 72% of
shares will be eligible to be sold in the public market 180 days after this
offering. The following table indicates approximately when the 28,457,508 shares
of our common stock that were outstanding as of June 30, 2000, assuming
conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into
13,824,817 shares of common stock and assuming the issuance of 8,000,000 shares
of common stock to Ford on August 29, 2000 in connection with our acquisition of
Ford's global customs unit, will be eligible for sale into the public market:

    In the event that any of our existing stockholders exercise registration
rights granted by prior agreements, additional shares of our common stock would
be available in the public market. Any such resales may make it more difficult
for us to raise capital through the sale of securities in the future at a time
and at a price that we deem appropriate.

Your ability to influence corporate matters may be limited because our officers,
directors and affiliates will be able to control, and Ford will be able to
influence, matters requiring stockholder approval and may have interests that
differ from yours.

    Following the closing of this offering, our officers, directors and
affiliated entities, including Ford, together will beneficially own
approximately 50.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, 49.6% if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. In addition, Ford will
beneficially own approximately 23.2% of the outstanding shares of our common
stock, 22.6% if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. As
the single largest stockholder of Vastera, Ford may have significant influence
over corporate acts requiring stockholder approval, including a merger or sale
of the Company. As long as Ford holds at least 5% of our common stock, it has
the right to appoint a non-voting observer to our board of directors.
Accordingly, these stockholders collectively will be able to control all matters
requiring stockholder approval and, thereby, our management and affairs. In
addition,

                                       14
<PAGE>
this concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would
result in a change of control, which in turn could reduce the market price of
our common stock. Our officers, directors and affiliated entities, including
Ford, may have interests that differ from your interests and their decisions may
negatively impact our future success.

Our management has broad discretion over how to use the proceeds of this
offering; we may not use the proceeds in ways with which you agree or that help
achieve our growth strategy and our revenues may decline.

    We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be $64.0 million,
at an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and after
deducting the estimated underwriting discount and offering expenses. See "Use of
Proceeds" for a detailed description of how management intends to apply the net
proceeds of this offering. Our management will have broad discretion as to how
to apply the net proceeds of this offering. If we fail to use these proceeds
effectively, we may not achieve our growth strategy and our revenues may
decline.

Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution.

    Purchasers of our common stock in the offering will pay a price per share
which substantially exceeds the per share value of our net tangible book value.
Our net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2000 was $.13 per share,
taking into account the pro forma adjustments for the automatic conversion of
all our outstanding convertible preferred stock into common stock upon
consummation of this offering and for the acquisition of Ford's global customs
unit. In addition, purchasers of our common stock in the offering will have
contributed approximately 35.9% of the aggregate price paid by all purchasers of
our stock, but will own only approximately 17.4% of our common stock outstanding
after the offering. As a result, if we were to distribute our net tangible
assets to our stockholders immediately following this offering, purchasers of
shares of our common stock in this offering would receive less than the amount
paid for those shares. In the past, we issued options and warrants to acquire
common stock at prices significantly below the initial public offering price.
Any exercises of outstanding warrants or options to buy shares of our common
stock will result in further dilution of the value of shares purchased in this
offering. For a more complete discussion, please see "Dilution."

Other companies may have difficulty acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit
our stockholders, due to provisions of our corporate charter and bylaws,
Delaware law and Ford's significant ownership position.

    Provisions in our certificate of incorporation, in our bylaws and under
Delaware law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us,
even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which
may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:

    - a staggered board of directors, where stockholders elect only a minority
      of the board each year;

    - advance notification procedures for matters to be brought before
      stockholder meetings;

    - a limitation on who may call stockholder meetings; and

    - a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent.

    We are subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging
in any business combination with any "interested stockholder," meaning generally
a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock, for a period of
three years from the date this

                                       15
<PAGE>
person became an interested stockholder, unless various conditions are met, such
as approval of the transaction by our board. This could have the effect of
delaying or preventing a change in control. For a more complete discussion of
these provisions of Delaware law, please see "Description of Capital
Stock--Delaware Anti-Takeover Law and Provisions in Our Charter and Bylaws."

    Additionally, in connection with establishing our strategic relationship
with Ford, Ford has acquired a 28.1% ownership interest in us. See "Principal
Stockholders." Because of Ford's significant holdings, other companies may be
deterred from acquiring us, even if being acquired would be in the best interest
of our other stockholders.

               SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that address, among
other things, market acceptance of our solutions, expansion into new targeted
industries, product development, sales and marketing strategies, development and
maintenance of strategic alliances, technological advancement, global expansion,
use of proceeds, projected capital expenditures, liquidity and availability of
additional funding sources. These statements may be found in the sections of
this prospectus entitled "Prospectus Summary," "Risk Factors," "Use of
Proceeds," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations," "Our Business" and in this prospectus generally. In some
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may,"
"will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates,"
"predicts," "potential," "continue" or the negative of such terms or other
comparable terminology. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,
including all the risks discussed in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this
prospectus. Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update
publicly any forward looking statements after the date of this Prospectus to
conform such statements to actual results.

<PAGE>
                                USE OF PROCEEDS

    We expect to receive approximately $64.0 million in net proceeds from the
sale of the 6,000,000 shares of common stock in this offering, assuming that the
initial public offering price is $12.00 per share and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We expect to receive approximately $74.0 million if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital,
create a public market for our common stock, facilitate future access by us to
public capital markets and provide us with increased visibility in our markets.
We have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds of this offering and
intend to use such proceeds for general corporate purposes, principally working
capital for increased domestic and international sales and marketing
expenditures, product development expenditures, expenditures related to the
expansion of our consulting services organization and capital expenditures made
in the ordinary course of business. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds to expand internationally, to acquire or invest in additional
businesses, products and technologies that we believe will complement our
current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or
commitments, oral or written, to do so. We are not currently engaged in any
negotiations for any acquisition or strategic investment. The amounts that we
actually expend for working capital purposes will vary significantly depending
on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, the amount of
cash we generate from operations and the progress of our product development
efforts. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the
net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

                                DIVIDEND POLICY

    We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend
to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our
business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future.
Under the terms of our current loan facility with PNC Bank, we are also
restricted from declaring or paying any dividends on any class of equity
securities. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources" for a more complete
discussion of our facility with PNC Bank.

                                    DILUTION

    As of June 30, 2000, our net tangible book value on a pro forma basis giving
effect to the automatic conversion of our convertible preferred stock into
common stock upon consummation of this offering and to both the issuance of
8,000,000 shares of common stock to Ford and the acquisition of an estimated
$80.0 million of net assets from Ford in connection with our acquisition of
Ford's global customs unit completed on August 29, 2000 was approximately
$3.6 million, or $0.13 per share of common stock. "Net tangible book value" per
share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount
of our total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock
outstanding. As of June 30, 2000, our net tangible book value, on a pro forma
basis as adjusted for the sale of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, based on
an assumed initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering
expenses, would have been approximately $1.96 per share. This represents an
immediate increase of $1.83 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate
dilution of $10.04 per share to new investors. The following table illustrates
this per share dilution:

    THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH "SELECTED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL DATA" AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES
APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS WHICH ARE DEEMED TO BE INCORPORATED INTO

PROSPECTUS.

Overview

    We are a leading provider of web-based software products and services that
facilitate international buying and selling by streamlining and optimizing
global trade processes. We call these products and services our solutions.
Global trade involves the shipment of goods between countries and the management
of information and business processes required to complete shipments. In 1992,
we introduced EMS-2000, a U.S.-centric, DOS-based export management solution. In
1994, we introduced EMS-2000 Version 4, a multi-country, two-tier, Windows-based
export management solution. In 1997, we introduced Global Passport, a
multi-country, three-tier, client-server based, import/export management
solution. In 2000, we introduced TradeSphere, a multi-country, multi-module
suite of web-based global trade management solutions and we introduced
TradePrism.com, a trade portal that provides a web-based delivery mechanism for
our global trade management capabilities. Since our inception, we have continued
to develop comprehensive solutions with features, functionality and services
that allow companies to manage the complexities of global trade.

    We provide our products and services from our offices in the United States
and United Kingdom to over 200 clients. Our clients typically acquire a limited
number of server and user subscriptions or licenses to implement in a division
or department. As they expand implementation of our products globally and to
their clients, suppliers, and business partners, additional subscriptions or
licenses are acquired. We currently market our products and services on a global
basis through our direct sales force and other channels, such as strategic
alliances and partners. We expect revenues from our international operations to
increase as we continue to expand our international sales and services
organizations.

    In connection with our acquisition of Ford's global customs unit in August
2000, we will provide Ford with global trade management services. We will
initially provide our suite of product and service offerings to Ford in the
United States. If we have successfully implemented our services in the United
States, we will have the opportunity under our agreement with Ford to provide
our services to Ford divisions and subsidiaries in other geographic regions
around the world. The contractual terms relating to the foreign operations have
not been finalized and are subject to negotiation based upon the actual costs
incurred in 2000. These costs include personnel costs, administrative overhead
and information technology processing costs. These costs will be determined
using Ford's accounting records.

    Our agreement with Ford has a minimum term of four years and may continue
for a total of ten years. After July 1, 2003, either party may terminate for any
reason after providing the non-terminating party one year's advance notice.
Commencing on July 1, 2004 and continuing thereafter, either party may terminate
the agreement for any reason upon providing six months' advance written notice.

    We will be compensated for our services based on the number of transactions
executed, subject to certain minimum transaction levels through 2004. The
transaction thresholds are consistent with the historical transaction activity.
The historical number of transactions have been increasing over time and we
believe this trend will continue as Ford expands its globalization and increases
the complexity of shipping parts. The transaction fee was a

                                       21
<PAGE>
negotiated amount based upon the estimated costs of managing international
transactions. A transaction, also known as a "customs entry," is a declaration
for imported goods imported from Ford, under one conveyance, on one day. Each
request submitted for the shipment of goods becomes a customs entry at the time
the shipment enters the commerce of a nation. Although Ford has the ability to
manage the number of transactions, based on customs regulations and Ford's
just-in-time production process, opportunities to combine multiple transactions
into one customs entry are limited and not employed by Ford in the customs
clearance of goods.

    The agreement also calls for gainsharing revenues equal to 10% of annual
cost savings up to a certain threshold and 15% above that threshold. Cost
savings shall be calculated by comparing the historical costs incurred by Ford
with the future costs incurred under our agreement with Ford. These costs
include only duty, taxes, other related government payments and customs broker
costs paid by Ford.

    This customer relationship will have a significant impact on our total
revenue and is expected to account for greater than 10% of revenues for the
foreseeable future, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2000.
Approximately one-third of the revenues derived by Ford's global customs unit
historically have been attributable to its foreign operations. As a result, if
we enter into one or more agreements with Ford to provide services to Ford
operations in other countries and regions, we expect to experience an
increasingly higher percentage of our revenues from foreign operations in the
future.

Recent Acquisitions

  FORD GLOBAL CUSTOMS UNIT

    In July 2000, we entered into an agreement to acquire Ford's global customs
unit. Under the terms of the agreement, in August 2000, we merged Ford's global
customs unit into our managed services operations. The Ford operations merged
into us consist of Ford personnel and the technology currently utilized by Ford
to manage its international trade transactions. Of the approximately
110 employees of the global customs unit, we expect 75% of these employees to
transfer to Vastera from Ford. Currently, 29 of the 33 U.S.-based Ford employees
have accepted employment with us. Select Ford employees in the other geographic
regions will be offered employment with us when these regions are phased in. In
connection with the agreement, Ford has agreed to assign to us any employees
that are performing its import/export customs operations that choose not to
transfer. The services of these employees will be provided for a minimum of two
years, during which time Vastera will train existing employees or hire other
employees to replace these workers. By combining our existing technology and
intellectual capital with that acquired from Ford, we intend to expand our
managed services offerings to companies of varying sizes on a global basis. Ford
has received 8,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at approximately $79.2
million in consideration of the transaction.

    QUANTUM CONSULTING ASSOCIATES, INC.

    In June 1999, we acquired Quantum Consulting Associates, Inc. of Denver,
Colorado to enhance our trade process consulting services and trade expertise.
The shareholders of Quantum received $439,000 in cash and 567,000 shares of our
common stock valued at approximately $1.5 million, in exchange for all of the
outstanding common stock of Quantum.

  DELTAC LIMITED

    In January 1999, we acquired Deltac Limited., a provider of trade content
and management consulting expertise for the United Kingdom (UK) and European
Union (EU). The shareholders of Deltac received $100,000 in cash and 189,000
shares of our common stock valued at $409,000, in exchange for all of the
outstanding common stock of Deltac.

                                       22
<PAGE>
    These acquisitions were all accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting. The excess of the consideration over the fair value of the acquired
assets and liabilities related to our Quantum and Deltac acquisitions of
approximately $2.4 million was accounted for as goodwill. The excess of the
consideration over the fair value of the acquired assets of Ford's global
customs unit that has been accounted for as goodwill and identifiable
intangibles is estimated to be $70.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.
Goodwill and identifiable intangibles are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over three to four years and resulted in charges to operations of
approximately $313,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and approximately
$239,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2000. In the aggregate, amortization
for future periods is expected to be approximately $7.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000, approximately $20.7 million for the years ending
December 31, 2001 and 2002, approximately $20.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2003 and approximately $12.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

Source of Revenues and Revenue Recognition Policy

    Our revenues are classified as either subscription/transaction revenues or
services revenues. In 2000, we renamed our software products and services as
follows:

    - our Global Passport software product is now called TradeSphere;

    - our strategic and operational consulting services are now called
      TradeValue;

    - our managed-services consisting of Global e-Content, TradeSphere and our
      proprietary methodology and services is now called TradeVantage.

    A description of our current revenue classifications follows:

  SUBSCRIPTION/TRANSACTION REVENUES

    Subscription/transaction revenues consist of subscription-based revenues,
transaction-based revenues and perpetual software license revenues.

    Subscription-based Revenues. Subscription-based revenues are revenues
derived from subscription arrangements in which our clients subscribe to the use
of TradeSphere, TradePrism.com and TradeVantage, our managed services
organization for a contract term. Revenues are recognized ratably over the
contract term. Subscription arrangements typically range from three to five
years. Payment on subscription arrangements are typically collected annually,
quarterly, or monthly.

    Transaction-based Revenues. Transaction-based revenues are revenues derived
from agreements which provide for transaction fees based on usage of
TradeSphere, TradePrism.com and TradeVantage. Revenues are recognized as
transactions occur. Payments on transaction revenues are typically collected
monthly. Our transaction-based agreements, including our Ford agreements, are
often subject to minimum transaction thresholds.

    Perpetual Software License Revenues. Perpetual software license revenues are
derived from the sales of perpetual software licenses and the related
maintenance contract. Maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified
enhancements on a when-and-if available basis, ongoing support and content
update services. In general, our active clients renew these maintenance
contracts to obtain access to these significant and frequent content updates.
Revenues from perpetual software license sales are recognized ratably over the
estimated economic life of the product (three years). Revenues from maintenance
contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term, typically one year.
Payments on perpetual software license sales are typically collected upon
contract signing or shortly thereafter. Payments on maintenance revenues are
typically collected annually in advance, but may also be collected quarterly in
advance.

                                       23

  SERVICES REVENUES

    Our services revenues consist of TradeSphere services revenues and
TradeValue services revenues.

    TradeSphere Services Revenues. TradeSphere services revenues are derived
from implementation and training services. These revenues are provided on either
a time-and-materials or on a fixed-price basis and are recognized as the
services are performed or on a percentage-of-completion basis.

    TradeValue Services Revenues. TradeValue services revenues are derived from
management consulting. These revenues are provided on either a
time-and-materials or on a fixed-price basis and are recognized as the services
are performed or on a percentage-of-completion basis.

    Our services revenues have increased due to the growth in our client base,
expansion of our implementation organization and expansion of our management
consulting organization. Services revenues are typically billed and collected
monthly. In the future we expect services revenues to decrease as a percentage
of total revenues.

    Our sales cycle averages six to nine months. Furthermore, we have
experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant variation in the
size of individual sales. As a result of this and other factors, our results
have varied significantly in the past and are likely to be subject to
significant fluctuations in the future. Since subscription/transaction revenues
are recognized ratably, and the timing of services revenues is dependent on the
scope of the engagement, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of the
results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results we expect
for any future period.

Deferred Revenues

    Deferred revenues include amounts billed to clients for which revenues have
not been recognized and generally result from billed, but deferred
subscription/transaction revenues and deferred services not yet rendered.
Deferred revenues will be recognized on a monthly basis over the remaining
economic life of the product or recognized as revenues when the services are
performed. As we continue to increase our subscription and transaction-based
revenues relative to our perpetual licenses, we expect our deferred revenues to
decrease.

Cost of Revenues

    Cost of revenues includes the cost of our subscription/transaction revenues
and the cost of our services revenues. Cost of subscription/transaction revenues
includes royalties due to third parties for technology products integrated into
our software products as well as the cost of salaries and related expenses for
our technical support and managed services organizations.

    We have a value-added reseller license agreement with Sun Microsystems and,
effective June 2000 through December 2002, we have the right to sublicense Sun's
software royalty free. Prior to June 2000, we were required to pay a royalty of
2% of revenues generated from the sale of our base application package in
exchange for the right to sublicense Sun's software. We also have an OEM
Software License agreement with IBM in which we have agreed to pay IBM a royalty
of $350,000 for the year 2000 and 6% of the contract value of products shipped
with IBM content for years 2001 through 2005 in exchange for the right to
sublicense IBM's software.

    Cost of subscription/transaction revenues also includes the cost of salaries
and related expenses for our client support, which includes our technical
support and managed services organization. We expect the cost of
subscription/transaction revenues to continue to increase as we further expand
our offerings and integrate other technology products into our product
offerings.

                                       24
<PAGE>
    Cost of services revenues includes the cost of salaries and related expenses
for implementation, management consulting, and training services provided to
clients, as well as, the cost of third parties contracted to provide either
application consulting or implementation services to our clients. The total cost
of revenues may fluctuate based on the mix of products and services sold.

    We expect our cost of subscription/transaction revenues to increase as a
result of our recent transaction-based managed services contract signed with
Ford. In the short term, we expect our gross margins on subscription/transaction
revenues to decrease until we are able to fully integrate Ford's technology with
our technology and increase the number of additional customers subscribing to
managed trade services.

Stock-based Compensation

    We recorded deferred compensation of approximately $6.4 million in the last
six months of 1999 and approximately $12.3 million in the first six months of
2000. These amounts represent the difference between the exercise price and the
fair value for accounting purposes of the underlying common stock at the date of
grant. This amount is included as a component of stockholders' equity and is
being amortized on an accelerated basis over the applicable vesting period.

    For the year ended December 31, 1999 and the six months ended June 30, 2000,
we amortized approximately $378,000 and approximately $5.6 million of deferred
compensation, respectively. We expect to amortize deferred compensation of
approximately $9.9 million, $5.0 million, $2.5 million, $867,000 and $25,000 for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The amount of
stock option compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could
decrease if options are forfeited for which accrued but unvested compensation
has been recorded.

Beneficial Conversion

    On February 4, 2000 and February 29, 2000, pursuant to a stock purchase
agreement with new and existing investors, we issued approximately 1,569,000
shares of Series E convertible preferred stock for approximately $17.0 million.
We recorded a beneficial conversion feature as a dividend of approximately
$8.1 million in the first quarter of 2000 to reflect the difference between the
underlying convertible price per share of common stock and the estimated fair
market value for accounting purposes of the common stock on the date of
issuance.

Research and Development

    In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise
Marketed," we have evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of
our products during the development phase. The time period during which costs
could be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until
the time of general product release is very short and, consequently, the amounts
that could be capitalized are not material to our financial position or results
of operations.

Comparison of Six Months Ended June 30, 1999 to Six Months Ended June 30, 2000

  REVENUES

    Total revenues. Total revenues increased 47% from approximately
$9.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately
$13.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

    Subscription/transaction revenues. Subscription/transaction revenues
increased 91% from approximately $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30,
1999 to approximately $5.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. We
attribute this increase to continued growth in our client base resulting from
increased market acceptance of our product offerings and our increased sales and
marketing efforts. As we continue to focus our development and marketing efforts
on our TradeSphere and TradePrism.com solutions, and as a result of our managed
services agreement with Ford, we expect subscription/transaction revenues to
increase significantly as a percentage of total revenues.

    Services revenues. Services revenues increased 26% from approximately
$6.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately
$7.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. The increase resulted from
increases in our client base as well as in our average billing rates. We expect
the proportion of services revenues to total revenues to decrease significantly
as a result of our managed services agreement with Ford.

                                       26
<PAGE>
  COST OF REVENUES

    Cost of subscription/transaction revenues. The cost of
subscription/transaction revenues increased 140% from approximately $309,000 for
the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $741,000 for the six months
ended June 30, 2000. The increase resulted from our investment in our client
support infrastructure. The cost of subscription/transaction revenues, as a
percentage of subscription/transaction revenues was 10% for the six months ended
June 30, 1999 and 13% for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This increase as a
percentage of subscription/transaction revenues reflected our expansion of our
technical support and managed services organization. We expect the cost of
subscription/transaction revenues to increase as a percentage of
subscription/transaction revenues as we invest heavily in our support
infrastructure due to our managed services agreement with Ford, experience
greater royalty costs associated with our OEM agreement with IBM, and expand our
product offerings and integrate other technology products into our offerings.

    Cost of services revenues. The cost of services revenues increased 52% from
approximately $4.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to
approximately $6.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2000. This increase
resulted from the hiring and training of consulting and training personnel to
support our increased client base. The cost of services revenues as a percentage
of services revenues was 69% for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 83% for
the six months ended June 30, 2000. This increase reflects our focus on hiring
and training personnel in our management consulting organization. Although these
increased costs negatively affected our gross margin, we expect the cost of
services revenues to decrease as a percentage of services revenues as we
continue to make productivity improvements in both our management consulting as
well as our implementation and training organizations.

  OPERATING EXPENSES

    Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of
salaries, commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel, sales
training events, public relations, advertising, trade shows, and travel expenses
related to both promotional events and direct sales efforts. Sales and marketing
increased 129% from approximately $2.9 million for the six months ended
June 30, 1999 to approximately $6.6 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000. This increase resulted from our continued investment in our sales and
marketing infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. The investments
included significant personnel and related expenses, recruiting fees, travel
expenses, and related facility and equipment costs. In addition, we increased
marketing activities, including trade shows, public relations, direct mail
campaigns and other promotional activities during this period. Sales and
marketing expenses represented 32% of our total revenues for the six months
ended June 30, 1999 and 49% for the six months ended June 30, 2000. We believe
that we will need to continue to increase our sales and marketing expenses to
expand our market position. As a result, we anticipate that sales and marketing
expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts but decrease as a
percentage of total revenues in future years.

    Research and development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of salaries, benefits and equipment for software developers, quality
assurance personnel, program managers, and technical writers. Research and
development expenses increased 159% from approximately $2.4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $6.2 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2000. This increase resulted from an increase in the number of
internal and contract software developers and quality assurance personnel needed
to support our product development and testing activities.

                                       27
<PAGE>
Research and development expenses represented 26% of our total revenues for the
six months ended June 30, 1999 and 46% for the six months ended June 30, 2000.
We believe that we must continue to invest in research and development in order
to develop new products and services. As a result, we anticipate that research
and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts
but decrease as a percentage of total revenues.

    General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist
primarily of salaries, benefits and related costs for executive, finance,
administrative and information services personnel. These expenses also include
fees for legal, audit and accounting, and other professional services. General
and administrative expenses increased 72% from approximately $1.4 million for
the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $2.4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. This increase resulted from the addition of
executive, finance and administrative personnel to support the growth of our
business. General and administrative expenses represented 15% of our total
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 18% for the six months ended
June 30, 2000. The increase as a percentage of total revenues reflected our
expansion of our administrative staff. We believe our general and administrative
expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollar amounts, but decrease as a
percentage of total revenues as we expand our administrative staff, domestically
and internationally, and incur expense associated with becoming a public
company. We expect these expenses to include annual and other public reporting
costs, directors' and officers' liability insurance, investor relations programs
and additional legal, accounting and consulting fees.

    Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased 76% from approximately $569,000
for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $1.0 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. This increase resulted from the depreciation of
fixed assets purchased to build the infrastructure needed to support the growth
of our business. Depreciation expense represented 6% of our total revenues for
the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 7% for the six months ended June 30,
2000.

    Amortization. Amortization expense increased 223% from approximately $74,000
for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $239,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. This increase resulted from the amortization of
goodwill from the acquisitions of Deltac Limited in January 1999 and Quantum
Consulting Associates, Inc. in June 1999. Amortization expense represented 1% of
our total revenues for the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 2% for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. As part of the Ford transaction, we acquired an
assembled workforce that was valued at approximately $6.5 million. This
intangible asset will be amortized on a straight-line basis over three years
upon the closing of the transaction. As part of the Ford transaction we also
acquired the perpetual right to use their technology royalty free. This asset
was valued at approximately $2.3 million and will be amortized on a
straight-line basis over four years. In addition to recording the value
associated with the assembled workforce and the licensed technology, we will
record approximately $70.0 million in goodwill. The goodwill will be amortized
on a straight-line basis over the next four years beginning upon the closing of
the transaction.

    Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense increased from
zero for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $5.6 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2000. Deferred compensation of approximately
$12.7 million at June 30, 2000 will be amortized on an accelerated basis over

interest expense related to our term loans and realized gains and losses on
investments. Other income (expenses), net decreased from approximately $123,000
for the six months ended June 30, 1999 to approximately $72,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. The decrease reflects the additional interest
expense on the equipment line of credit for the six months ended June 30, 2000.

    Income taxes. No provision for income taxes has been recorded for either the
six months ended June 30, 1999 or the six months ended June 30, 2000 due to
accumulated net operating losses. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the
full amount of our net deferred tax assets as a result of the uncertainty
surrounding the timing of the realization of these future tax benefits.

Comparison of Year Ended December 31, 1998 to Year Ended December 31, 1999

  REVENUES

    Total revenues. Total revenues increased 116% from approximately
$8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately
$19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.

    Subscription/transaction revenues. Subscription/transaction revenues
increased 78% from approximately $4.1 million for the year ended December 31,
1998 to approximately $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. We
attribute this increase to growth in our client base resulting from increased
market acceptance of our product offerings and our increased sales and marketing
efforts.

    Services revenues. Services revenues increased 148% from approximately
$4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately
$11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from
increases in our client base and increases in our average billing rates. The
increase in services revenues as a percentage of total revenues was also
attributable to the acquisitions of Deltac Limited and Quantum Consulting
Associates, Inc. Included in our services revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1999 is approximately $727,000 of services revenues attributable to
the acquisitions of Deltac Limited and Quantum Consulting Associates, Inc.
$727,000, or approximately 10%, of the $7.1 million increase in services
revenues was attributable to these acquisitions.

  COST OF REVENUES

    Cost of subscription/transaction revenues. The cost of
subscription/transaction revenues decreased 2% from approximately $708,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately $692,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999. While we had an increase in our client support costs, it was
more than offset by our ability to negotiate more favorable royalty rates for
technology products integrated into our software products. The cost of
subscription/transaction revenues, as a percentage of subscription/transaction
revenues, was 17% for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 10% for the year
ended December 31, 1999.

    Cost of services revenues. The cost of services revenues increased 140% from
approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately
$10.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from
the hiring and training of consulting and training personnel to support our
increased client base. The cost of services revenues as a percentage of services
revenues was 88% for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 85% for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This decrease reflects productivity improvements in our
implementation and training organizations in 1999. However, this decrease was
offset by our focus on hiring and training personnel in our management
consulting organization.

approximately $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately
$7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from
our increased investment in our sales and marketing infrastructure, both
domestically and internationally, in the anticipation of future market growth.
The investments included significant personnel related expenses, recruiting
fees, travel expenses, and related facility and equipment costs. In addition, we
increased marketing activities, including trade shows, public relations, direct
mail campaigns and other promotional activities. Sales and marketing expenses
represented 52% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 and
37% for the year ended December 31, 1999. This decrease reflects the higher
revenue base, as well as improvements achieved in productivity of our sales
organization.

from approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
approximately $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase
resulted from an increase in the number of software developers and quality
assurance personnel needed to support our product development and testing
activities. Research and development expenses represented 48% of our total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 32% for the year ended

44% from approximately $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998 to
approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase

to support the growth of our business. General and administrative expenses
represented 29% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 and
19% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease as a percentage of total
revenues reflected efficiencies gained throughout our administrative processes
as we have grown as a company.

    Depreciation. Depreciation expense increased 106% from approximately
$637,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately $1.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from the depreciation
of fixed assets purchased to build the infrastructure needed to support the
growth of our business. Depreciation expense represented 7% of our total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998 and 7% for the year ended
December 31, 1999.

    Amortization. There was no amortization expense for the year ended
December 31, 1998 and there was approximately $313,000 for the year ended
December 31, 1999. This increase resulted from amortization of goodwill from the
acquisition of Deltac Limited in January 1999 and Quantum Consulting
Associates, Inc. in June 1999. There was no amortization expense for the year
ended December 31, 1998 and an amount equal to 2% of revenues was recorded for
the year ended December 31, 1999.

    Stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense increased from
zero for the year ended December 31, 1998 to approximately $378,000 for the year

December 31, 1999 will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the applicable
vesting period.

    Other income (expenses), net. Other income (expenses), net increased from
approximately ($157,000) for the year ended December 31, 1998 to $181,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase reflects the investment income
earned on the proceeds of our private placement during 1998.

    Income taxes. No provision for income taxes has been recorded for either the
year ended December 31, 1998 or the year ended December 31, 1999 due to
accumulated net operating losses. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the
full amount of our net deferred tax assets as a result of the uncertainty
surrounding the timing of the realization of these future tax benefits.

    As of December 31, 1999, we had net operating loss carry-forwards for
federal tax purposes of approximately $19.5 million. These federal tax loss
carry-forwards are available to reduce future taxable income and begin to expire
in 2011. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, certain substantial
changes in our ownership have occurred, and as a result, our future utilization
of these net operating carry-forwards, that we accumulated prior to the change
in ownership, may be subject to a limitation per year. We may generate
additional net operating loss carry-forwards in the future.

    Our operating results have varied on a quarterly basis and may fluctuate
significantly in the future. In addition, the quarterly results of any quarter
do not indicate results to be expected for a full fiscal year.

    For the three months ended December 31, 1999, services revenues decreased
sequentially due to the effect of Year 2000 issues. Many clients postponed the
start of any new service engagements scheduled to begin in November and
December 1999 and instead started these engagements in the first quarter of
2000. Consequently, the increase in services revenues by 60% or approximately
$1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2000 resulted partially from
these delayed engagements. Training revenues, which are a component of services
revenues, also decreased for the same reasons. The overall gross margin
decreased in quarters ending June 1999 through December 1999 as a result of
increased costs related to our acquisition of Quantum Consulting
Associates, Inc. The acquisition of Quantum allowed us to enhance our offering
of management consulting services. We have continued to hire personnel and
enhance our capabilities in this area through December 1999. Our gross margin
was negatively affected in the quarter ended December 1999 as a combined result
of decreased services revenues related to Year 2000 issues and increased costs
related to our acquisition of Quantum.

    Operating expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 decreased
approximately $553,000 from the quarter ended March 31, 2000. This decrease was
primarily due to our decreased usage in contract development as well as a
decrease in recruiting fees in our sales, marketing and administrative areas.

    Other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include
those described below and elsewhere in this prospectus:

    - Our ability to attract new clients and retain current clients which could
      lead to changes in our revenues;

    - The announcement or introduction of new products or services by us or our
      competitors which could also lead to changes in our revenues;

    - Changes in the pricing of our products and services or those of our
      competitors;

    - Variability in the mix of our subscription/transaction and services
      revenues in any quarter which could affect our margins; and

    - The amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures
      relating to expansion of our business.

    We believe that, while the quarterly period to period comparisons furnish
important information about our revenues and expenses, these comparisons are not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future
performance. Finally, as a result of these foregoing factors, our annual or
quarterly results of operations may be below the expectations of the public
market analysts or investors. If this occurs, the market price of our common
stock may decline.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

    We have primarily financed our operations through private sales of
convertible preferred stock, borrowings under our line of credit and capital
lease obligations, and net revenues generated from our business. Through
June 30, 2000, we have raised cumulative net proceeds of approximately
$45.5 million through convertible preferred stock offerings. The purchasers of
our convertible preferred stock were venture capital firms, a retirement fund
and FedEx Corporation. These entities are unrelated third parties and FedEx
subsequently sold its holding to some of our other stockholders. As of June 30,
2000, we had cash and cash equivalents of

                                       34
<PAGE>
approximately $374,000 plus short term investments of approximately
$8.7 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately $82.8 million. The
Company has a $2.5 million secured revolving credit facility and a $4.8 million
equipment line of credit with PNC Bank. As of June 30, 2000, there was no
outstanding indebtedness under the secured revolving credit facility and
$3.3 million outstanding under the equipment line of credit, respectively.

    Net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $5.5 million in
1997, $3.9 million in 1998, $5.7 million in 1999 and $14.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. Net cash flows from operating activities in each
period reflect net losses of approximately $9.3 million in 1997, $8.3 million in
1998, $10.5 million in 1999 and $15.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
2000, and to a lesser extent, are offset by the non-cash expenses relating to
depreciation and amortization, provision for allowance for doubtful accounts and
stock-based compensation. In addition the net cash used in operations was
increased by the growth in accounts receivable and decreased by the growth in
accounts payable, accrued compensation and deferred revenues.

    The Company expects to pay approximately $443,000 in fees to Ford each month
for the maintenance of licensed technology, the costs of leased employees and
other facility expenses.

    Net cash used in investing activities totaled approximately $510,000 in
1997, $2.8 million in 1998, $3.2 million in 1999 and $5.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. Our investing activities reflect the additions of
property and equipment, purchases of investments, and the acquisition of
subsidiaries completed during 1999. We also anticipate that our capital
expenditures will increase over the next several years as we expand our
facilities and acquire equipment to support expansion of our sales, marketing,
and research and development activities.

    Our financing activities provided cash of approximately $6.1 million in
1997, $13.1 million in 1998, $2.1 million in 1999 and $19.7 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2000. These positive financing cash flows primarily
reflect the net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred
stock, and from the issuance of the line of credit and capital lease
obligations. In May 2000, pursuant to stock agreements with existing investors,
various existing investors exercised their preferred stock warrants. We issued
approximately 104,000 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, 357,000
shares of Series C-1 convertible preferred stock, and 197,000 of Series D-1
convertible preferred stock for approximate net proceeds of $2.5 million.

    Amounts borrowed from one lending institution for capital leases are due
over 36 to 48-month repayment periods and are collateralized by our software
products. As of December 31, 1998, 1999 and June 30, 2000, the outstanding
balance under this capital lease agreement was approximately $1.4 million,
$1.0 million and $781,000 respectively.

    In March 1999, we obtained a $2.5 million secured revolving credit facility
and a $1.5 million equipment line of credit. The line bears interest at prime
rate plus 0.75% percent for the secured revolving credit facility and prime rate
plus 0.85% percent for the equipment line of credit. In September 1999, we
negotiated to increase the equipment line to $3.0 million.

    The terms of our line of credit require us to comply with certain financial
covenants. As of December 31, 1999, we were in violation of these covenants. On
February 3, 2000, the bank granted us a waiver of past covenant violations and
waived its right to call the line of credit for these covenant violations.

    On March 31, 2000, we amended the existing financial covenants and increased
our equipment line of credit to $4,800,000. Pursuant to an amendment dated
June 19, 2000, our financial covenants were clarified by the bank to exclude all
non-cash charges from the

                                       35
<PAGE>
calculations of the covenants. The most restrictive of the amended financial
covenants is that our operating losses, as defined, can not exceed $5,000,000
for the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of 2000 and for the first
fiscal quarter of 2001, and $2,000,000 in any quarter thereafter, and, beginning
in the first quarter of 2002, we are not permitted to have two consecutive
quarters with operating losses. As calculated under the amended financial
covenants, our operating loss for the second quarter of 2000 was approximately
$4.1 million. Other financial covenants, which were amended, require that we
maintain minimum tangible net worth, as defined, as follows (in thousands):

September 30, 2001..........................................       (11,750)
Thereafter..................................................       (11,250)
</TABLE>

    As calculated under the amended financial covenants, our tangible net worth
as of June 30, 2000 was approximately $10.9 million.

    We expect to pay approximately $2.0 million, $2.0 million, $1.3 million,
$535,000 and $376,000 on our equipment line of credit and lease agreements in
2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We will fund these commitments
through our current cash resources, the proceeds of this offering and our future
cash flow from operations.

    In March 2000, we renegotiated the financial covenants applicable to our
secured revolving credit facility and increased our aggregate borrowing limit
under the equipment line of credit to $4.8 million. We are currently in
compliance with all restrictions and covenants relating to our credit
facilities. These financial covenants, among other things, restrict us from
incurring operating losses in excess of stated amounts and require us to
maintain stated levels of minimum tangible net worth.

    Our secured revolving credit facility expires on September 5, 2000. We
expect to extend the term of this facility. The amounts borrowed under the
equipment line are initially subject to interest-only payments and after the
interest-only period will be repayable over a three-year time period.

    We intend to continue the investment in the business, particularly in the
areas of research and development, sales, and marketing. Our future liquidity
and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:

    - The costs and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities;

    - The costs and timing of product development efforts and the success of
      these development efforts;

    - The extent to which our existing and new products and services gain market
      acceptance;

    - The level and timing of revenues;

    - The costs involved in maintaining and enforcing intellectual property
      rights;

    - The timing of market developments; and

    - Available borrowings under line of credit and capital lease arrangements.

                                       36
<PAGE>
    In addition, we may use cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary
businesses and technologies; however, we currently have no commitments or
agreements and are not involved in any negotiations regarding any of these
transactions. We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, combined with
current cash resources, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Thereafter, we may find it
necessary to obtain additional equity or debt financing. In the event that
additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms
acceptable to us, if at all. See the related risk factor on page 8.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," and
issued SFAS No. 138 in June 2000 to amend SFAS No. 133. These statements
establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative securities
instruments and hedging activities. They require an entity to recognize all
derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and measure
those instruments at fair value. As we do not engage in derivative or hedging
activities, we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant
impact on our financial statements.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk

    We develop products in the United States and market our products in North
America, and to a lesser extent, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. As a
result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in
foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.
As a majority of sales are currently made in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of
the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets. We do
not expect any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,
results of operations or cash flows due to movements in any specific foreign
currency.

    We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses by
our European subsidiary. We intend to assess the need to utilize financial
instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis. Our interest income
is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates,
particularly since the majority of our investments are in short-term
instruments. Due to the short-term nature of our investments, we believe that
there is no material risk exposure. Therefore, no quantitative tabular
disclosures are required.

Overview

    We are a leading provider of web-based software products and services that
facilitate international buying and selling of goods by streamlining and
optimizing global trade processes. We call these products and services our
solutions. Global trade involves the shipment of goods between countries and the
management of information and business processes required to complete shipments.
Global trade is regulated by dynamic, country-specific rules and involves a
complex network of trade participants, namely exporters, forwarders, carriers,
brokers, importers, banks and customs and regulatory agencies. The core of our
solutions is our global trade content, which is our extensive on-line library of
country-specific rules and regulations that are needed to automate global trade
processes. Our web-based software applications utilize this content to improve
coordination and collaboration between the network of trade participants
required to complete international transactions. Our clients can subscribe to or
license our software products, use our transaction-based hosted service through
our Internet portal, TradePrism.com, or engage us to provide complete managed
services for part or all of their global trade operations.

    We believe the dynamics of global trade present both compelling
opportunities and challenges for companies participating in the global
marketplace. Global trade is complex and resource-intensive and has largely
remained a manual and inefficient process. The Internet and e-commerce provide
further opportunities for global expansion but also present significant
operational challenges. Our solutions enable clients to address these
difficulties and inefficiencies in order to capitalize on the large, highly
fragmented and rapidly growing opportunity that global e-commerce presents.

    We provide comprehensive trade content covering countries that accounted for
approximately $4.1 trillion of all global trade in 1999. We serve an
international client base of over 200 companies, including Dell, Ford, Lucent,
Microsoft, the New Zealand Dairy Board, Nike, Nortel and Sony. Our clients
currently utilize our solutions to ship to over 120 countries worldwide. We also
provide integrated solutions for specific industry segments, or vertical
industries, which are currently used by Internet trading exchanges such as
CatalogCity.com, Fasturn.com, RightFreight.com and SupplierMarket.com.

    On July 14, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Ford to acquire its
global customs unit including a number of its employees. We also entered into an
agreement whereby we will administer, automate and manage Ford's global customs
operations for a minimum of four years and a maximum of 10 years.

Industry Background

    The impact of multilateral trade agreements, the expansion of the modern
supply chain, competitive pressures and the rapid growth of e-commerce are
accelerating the pace of business globalization. The volume of global trade has
increased significantly over the last several decades and has reached an
unprecedented level in terms of both the number and size of transactions. The
World Trade Organization reported that world trade increased from $4.1 trillion
in 1980 to nearly $11.0 trillion in 1998. The U.S. Customs Service predicts that
U.S. imports alone will rise from more than $1 trillion in 1999 to approximately
$2 trillion by 2005. The U.S. Customs Service also projects that formal customs
entries will increase from approximately 18 million in 1999 to over 30 million
in 2005. As a result of this globalization, we believe the resources and
expertise necessary to manage global trade will increase significantly.

  DIFFICULTIES OF GLOBAL TRADE

    Complex Network. The modern global marketplace is a fast-paced, complex
trade network. Global trade involves an extended and geographically dispersed
network of exporters, forwarders, carriers, brokers, importers, banks and
customs and regulatory agencies. These participants must be coordinated to
manage the flow of goods, information and currency while satisfying extensive
country-specific trade requirements. These complex processes include classifying
and screening orders, determining and applying for required licenses, generating
and submitting extensive documentation, managing and minimizing country-specific
tariffs and duties, and tracking and tracing shipments across the entire global
trade network. Furthermore, trade requirements are unique for every country,
often poorly documented, constantly changing and difficult to interpret.

    Compliance Burden. The burden of responsibility for regulatory compliance
and documentation weighs heavily on all members of the global trade network. For
example, the U.S. Customs Service audits companies importing goods into the U.S.
These audits take an average of 15 months to complete and require an average of
1,900 audit hours. If caught in violation of international trade regulations,
companies face a variety of possible penalties and negative consequences,
including fines, loss of import/export privileges and adverse publicity. As a
result, companies must maintain an appropriate global trade compliance program
to understand who is buying their products and the end use of their products.

  INEFFICIENCIES OF GLOBAL TRADE

    Inadequate Infrastructure and Procedures. Intense global competition is
requiring businesses to collaborate effectively with members of their global
trade network and to efficiently manage and optimize the international trade
process. For example, companies are finding it necessary to collaborate with
trading partners to take advantage of preferential trade programs such as those
promulgated under the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In
addition, companies are maintaining excess inventory because their clients
demand heightened predictability and timely delivery, including real-time
tracking of shipments. Benchmarking Partners estimates that up to 25% of a
company's international inventory is maintained as surplus stock due primarily
to the inefficiencies of global trade. Historically, businesses have lacked the
technology and procedures necessary to capitalize fully on the growth
opportunities presented by globalization. For example, Forrester Research
estimates that 46% of Internet-based orders to the U.S. from international
clients go unfilled because companies lack the procedures for international
fulfillment.

    Resource-Intensive. The resource demands for global trade management are
extensive, and existing trade compliance procedures, which are largely manual
and paper-based, tend to be highly inefficient and error-prone. While trade
agreements such as NAFTA and the European Free Trade Agreement have lowered
duties and taxes, they have increased record-keeping requirements. Many
companies engaging in global trade find it cost prohibitive to maintain large
in-house staffs to address these requirements. As a result, these companies may
outsource their trade compliance and documentation processes to third-party
logistics firms or forwarders/brokers.

  THE ROLE OF THE INTERNET

    The rapid growth of the Internet as a global medium through which businesses
communicate, share information and conduct business internally and directly with
their clients, suppliers and other business partners worldwide has further
hastened this era of escalating global competition. Forrester Research estimates
that business-to-business e-

                                       39
<PAGE>
commerce will grow from approximately $406 billion in 2000 to approximately $2.7
trillion in 2004. Furthermore, the Internet provides the opportunity for
organizations to pursue solutions which automate and optimize the global trade
management processes.

  MARKET OPPORTUNITY

    We believe companies seeking to realize the benefits of global trade
management require solutions that address the following concerns:

    Lack of centralized, comprehensive and current global trade content. A
central, up-to-date library of global trade content is difficult to create and
maintain. As a result, there is a lack of a central source for this information.
Consequently, many multi-national companies resort to purchasing niche trade
solutions that cover only a limited number of countries or engage consulting
organizations specializing in selected countries to improve their global trade
practices. Given these deficiencies, we believe that companies are unable to
optimize decision-making based on access to dynamic centralized global trade
information.

    Limited capabilities of currently available solutions. In addition to
lacking comprehensive global trade content, currently available solutions lack
the capabilities required to effectively manage global trade processes. For
example, these solutions may address only limited global trade functions, such
as export document generation or import duty calculation. Furthermore, these
solutions may address the requirements of only one or a few of the participants
within the global trade network. Finally, many of these solutions lack the
technical architecture to operate over the Internet and do not provide the
portal capabilities necessary to facilitate collaboration among global trade
participants.

    Limited focus on global trade management. Global trade practices within
traditional consulting firms dedicate limited resources to the needs of their
clients across the entire global trade network. Companies offering global trade
consulting services typically focus on only one part of the process, such as
logistics or trade regulations, or on only a limited number of industries.

    Need for comprehensive managed services. Recently, an increasing number of
company executives in multiple sectors of global e-commerce have been indicating
to us a desire to have their global trade management issues solved as a
comprehensive managed service. The resources required to manage global trade
effectively are extensive and include global trade expertise, software solutions
and related information technology infrastructure and personnel to implement
these solutions. Companies frequently seek comprehensive outsourced solutions
from third parties to satisfy their global trade management needs because of the
high costs and resource demands associated with maintaining an in-house global
trade department.

Our Solutions

    We believe that we offer comprehensive solutions for global trade processes
that address all of these needs. The fundamental elements of our solutions
include:

    Centralized, comprehensive and current global trade content. Our extensive
and actively managed library of country-specific trade requirements is the core
of our solutions for global trade processes. We leverage our unique global trade
expertise and a sophisticated rules-based engine to deliver accurate,
comprehensive, up-to-date global trade information to our clients via a
web-based portal.

    Sophisticated, web-based solutions. Our solutions enable clients to automate
and optimize information management procedures across their entire global trade
network. In

                                       40
<PAGE>
addition, our solutions address the requirements of multiple members of a
client's extended global trade network and enable an efficient exchange of goods
and information among all of these participants.

    Industry and country-specific global trade expertise. Our management
consulting professionals analyze and address the global trade practices and
opportunities of our clients. Our consulting services help companies effectively
enter new geographic markets, better serve existing markets and address areas of
compliance risk. As part of our consulting offerings, we design, recommend and
implement process improvements for our clients.

    Comprehensive managed services. Our managed services offering utilizes our
content, our software and our trade expertise to enable our clients to rely on
us to manage their day-to-day global trade operations to us. We intend to
deliver services ranging from providing operational management for a single
global trade process to managing a client's worldwide trade operation. We
believe that our managed services can result in significant improvement in the
efficiency and effectiveness of our clients' existing global trade operations.

    Our global trade management solutions provide our clients with the following
benefits:

    Infrastructure to pursue global growth opportunities. Our global trade
solutions leverage our global trade expertise and web-based functionality to
simplify many of the complexities associated with global trade management.
Because our web-based solutions are flexible and modular, our clients can select
specific components, or engines, to address their particular global trade needs.
They may also choose to rely on us to manage all or parts of their global trade
network to us. We believe that our solutions improve the speed of the movement
of goods globally and the accuracy of trade information by automating the
exchange of data among each participant in the global trade network, resulting
in enhanced revenue opportunities, increased operational efficiencies and
reductions in the costs of global sourcing. Because our solutions automate these
processes, our clients can focus on their core competencies and compete more
effectively in the global marketplace. We believe that our solutions also
increase client service through on-time delivery of goods and ability to quote
clients a total purchase cost for the goods at order time, including duties,
taxes and fees. Our clients can also reduce accounts receivable collection times
through improved compliance with letters of credit and reduced shipment delays.

    Easy access to reliable global trade content. We constantly monitor and
interpret global trade rules and regulations and deliver them to our clients
through a dynamic web-based portal, which fully integrates with our solutions.
We believe that our ability to provide our clients with access to current,
centralized and standardized trade requirements differentiates us in the
marketplace. We believe that our solutions protect against potential fines,
sanctions and business risks that may result from non-compliant or inefficient
global trade processes and reduce excess inventory through more predictable
customs clearance times. We believe that our solutions reduce duties, taxes and
fees through leveraging the content of preferential duty programs such as NAFTA.

    Improved collaboration through enhanced technology. Our software solutions
provide a platform for clients to exchange information over the Internet with
members of their global trade network. Our Internet architecture includes XML
technology that enables our clients to exchange information with their trade
partners, regardless of differing information technology infrastructures,
systems or software. Our web-based solutions are flexible and user-friendly,
which we believe will facilitate their acceptance among the global trade
participants. Our solutions are also scalable in that they are capable of
satisfying the needs of a business as the

                                       41
<PAGE>
business continues to grow. This improved collaboration enables our clients to
more effectively move goods globally and strategically manage information
required in their global trade process.

    Leveraging of information technology investments. Our web-based platform is
designed to integrate existing information management systems and software
applications and work within the capacity of existing networks. The ability of
our products to integrate existing information systems and software applications
enables our clients to preserve and build upon their corporate knowledge and
information technology platform, while realizing the benefits of our web-based
solutions.

Strategy

    We seek to be the leading provider of solutions for the global trade
information management. The key elements of our strategy include:

    Promote multiple delivery models for our solutions. We intend to leverage
our web-based delivery model for our software solutions to expand our client
base and increase our revenues. We intend to capitalize on a growing demand for
managed services by hiring additional personnel with global trade expertise and
further developing our software capabilities. We intend to target clients for
these services ranging from the Fortune 500 companies to Internet start-ups.

    Target vertical industries and market segments. We plan to continue
developing various elements of our solutions to address the specific needs of
various vertical industries such as automotive, retail and technology, and trade
participants such as carriers and forwarders. For example, we intend to promote
our relationship with Ford to expand our penetration into the automotive
industry. We also intend to provide pre-configured solutions that are
competitively priced, quickly deployed and easily managed for mid-market to
small companies. In addition to in-house product development, we intend to
supplement these initiatives by evaluating opportunities for acquisitions and
strategic investments.

    Expand our global presence. We intend to continue expanding our global
presence to enhance our competitive position worldwide and our ability to serve
and support our clients. We anticipate expanding our sales, marketing and
services presence in strategically important geographic markets. Although we
will initially be providing Ford with global trade managed services in the
United States, we expect to expand the coverage of services to Ford's operations
in other geographic regions. In addition, we intend to utilize our strategic
alliances and foster our relationships with leaders within specific vertical
markets that participate in international trade. We also intend to evaluate
opportunities for acquisitions and investments that can accelerate our global
expansion.

    Expand our global trade content and enhance our software solutions. We
intend to continue to develop software solutions with features, capabilities and
functionality that allow companies of all sizes to manage the complexities of
global trade. Because access to reliable, country-specific trade requirements is
essential to companies engaging in global trade, we intend to fortify our trade
content by continuing to hire top global trade experts worldwide. We intend to
leverage certain of the information received from our relationship with Ford
into our content database, thereby permitting us to expand our content and
software solutions.

    Become the standard and preeminent brand for global trade management. We
plan to be the primary information resource for global trade management. We
expect to expand our

                                       42
<PAGE>
offerings of web-based trade content to cover countries engaged in over 75% of
the world's global trade transactions. We intend to launch a global branding
campaign that leverages our strategic alliances and relationships with clients,
governments and industry consultants.

  GLOBAL ECONTENT

    Global eContent is a dynamic library of country-specific trade requirements
that we provide to our clients. This extensive base of electronic content serves
as the platform for our entire suite of global trade management solutions. We
employ a full-time content and compliance team dedicated exclusively to tracking
and managing trade regulations, trade content and international regulatory data.
These full-time Global eContent experts also design intelligence into the data
to be leveraged by our solutions. For example, this intelligence includes
algorithms that can detect restricted parties even if names or addresses are
misspelled, or logic that can search for lower duty rates through preferential
programs. This team consists of former government compliance officials,
international lawyers, licensed customs brokers, in-country data experts,
industry consultants and individuals with previous responsibility for managing
import and export functions within multi-national organizations in various
industries.

    Periodic regulatory and policy changes require that our solutions be updated
on a regular basis to keep current with the latest country-specific trade
regulations. To meet this need, daily updates and postings are made available
through TradePrism.com, our web-based portal, from which updates and changes can
be electronically downloaded and applied. Information provided in our Global
eContent library includes trade data, regulation updates, regulation notices,
trade committee meeting information, requests for public comment on regulatory
issues and final rulings on proposed regulation.

Strategic Alliances

    We maintain strategic alliances with a number of technology leaders and
industry experts through written and oral agreements. While the strategic
relationships underlying these agreements are important, the agreements
themselves, with the exceptions of the license agreements with IBM and Sun
Microsystems, are not material to our operations and in many cases may be
terminated with little or no notice. The principal goals of our strategic
alliances are to accelerate the global market acceptance of our solutions, to
extend our global resources and to help our clients realize the benefits of our
solutions quickly. The strategic alliances that are subject to written
agreements are summarized as follows:

    - We license key components to our solutions from Sun Microsystems and IBM.
      The proprietary technology of these companies are integrated into our
      solutions. We, in turn, provide license fees for the use of their
      proprietary technology. Our license with IBM expires on June 30, 2006 and
      obligates us to pay IBM an initial fee of $350,000 to use IBM's content
      until January 1, 2001 and 6% of the revenue derived from sales of our
      solutions that contain IBM content thereafter. Our current license with
      Sun Microsystems expires on December 23, 2002 and obligates us to pay Sun
      Microsystems an initial fee of $300,000 and maintenance and technical
      support fees of approximately $30,000 per year.

    - We have marketing relationships with a number of enterprise resource
      planning, or ERP, companies including SAP, i2 Technologies, Baan and JD
      Edwards. Our solutions are tested and certified by these ERP companies to
      be compatible with and complementary to their respective enterprise
      software solutions. Our agreements with SAP, Baan and JD Edwards allows
      these ERP companies to market our solutions alongside their enterprise
      software solutions to their current and prospective clients.

    - Elements of our web-based solutions are being incorporated into a number
      of trade exchanges including CatalogCity.com, Fasturn.com,
      RightFreight.com and SupplierMarket.com. These trade exchanges work to
      connect separate parties, often in different countries, over the Internet
      to consummate a transaction. We have agreements with these trade exchanges
      that allow them to implement and embed our solutions into their product
      offerings.

    - We have strategic alliances with a number of consulting companies
      including Andersen Consulting and KPMG. Under our agreement with KPMG,
      KPMG agrees to disclose potential opportunities for new clients to Vastera
      and we agree to train their consultants in the use and implementation of
      our solutions.

    We also have informal agreements, with a number of leading technology
companies to develop compatibility of solutions, business opportunities and
cross-referrals of each other's existing client base.

Product Development

    Our product engineering team is made up of over 68 professionals focused on
new and developing solutions. Our product engineers are organized into the
following groups: quality assurance, documentation, release management, solution
development and sustaining engineering. Our solutions development is structured
around project teams that are comprised of developers led by a senior
development manager responsible for delivering a defined solution engine. This
structure allows for the organization to quickly scale and allows us to
outsource non-critical development activities when necessary to bring products
to market quickly. These dedicated product engineers are partnered with a
product management team consisting of experienced global trade professionals who
set the product plan and

                                       47
<PAGE>
requirements based on our business plan and market dynamics. Our engines are
tied into the complete TradeSphere suite through process and specifications
defined and managed by our infrastructure and integration team.

    In addition, our Global eContent development methodology and approach allows
us to deliver market leading solutions for import and export management for
specific countries. This effort requires synthesizing an often lengthy export or
import manual into a set of requirements that then are integrated with our
rules-based Global eContent engine. In addition, these solutions are designed so
that we can readily provide updates for frequent country regulation changes. We
believe our product development professionals, teamed with our 35 product
management trade professionals, allow us to provide robust, market-driven,
web-based technology solutions that are reliable and scalable.

    Our research and development expenses totaled approximately $6.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 and $6.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 which represented 32% and 46% of our total revenues, respectively.
We expect to significantly increase our research and development efforts in
future years.

* Denotes clients generating less than 1% of our revenues.

    Our long-standing relationships with clients such as Nortel, our newly
established relationship with Ford and our recent successes with clients, such
as the New Zealand Dairy Board and RightFreight.com, a business-to-business
solutions provider, demonstrate our ability to service a variety of large
multi-national corporations with complex trade management networks as well as
emerging Internet portals and marketplaces. While none of our clients currently
represent more than 10% of our revenues, we expect to derive more than 10% of
our revenues from Ford in the future.

Case Studies

    We believe the following case studies reflect the range of products and
services that we provide:

  NORTEL

    CHALLENGE:  Prior to implementing our solutions, Nortel handled its global
trade management functions either manually or through a variety of internally
developed systems. As Nortel's business increased and the number of
international shipments grew, Nortel experienced challenges generating the
volume of global trade documentation required, which resulted in delayed
deliveries as goods were held up in customs. Another issue was the lack of
product visibility within Nortel's own global network of over 90 shipping sites
as well as across its global trade network.

    SOLUTION:  Our solutions were first implemented in 1993 and are now Nortel's
standard for global trade management. Our solutions have been deployed in the
United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Brazil, Malaysia and Singapore. In late 1999,
Nortel purchased a subscription for TradeSphere and other web-based global trade
collaboration capabilities.

                                       49
<PAGE>
    RESULTS:  Our solutions have reduced Nortel's costs and improved global
trade information and time to market, resulting in more than $9.4 million of
value over two years. Our solutions were cited by Nortel as the project with the
highest return on investment for 1997.

  NEW ZEALAND DAIRY BOARD

    CHALLENGE:  The New Zealand Dairy Board (NZDB) is the world's largest single
dairy exporter, shipping more than 4,000 products to over 1,000 destination
ports in over 120 countries across six continents. Prior to implementing our
solutions, the NZDB maintained a 10-year-old legacy system and relied heavily on
contractors to modify this system. It also relied on frequent manual
intervention to handle business functions not addressed by its legacy system.
Each of the NZDB's international shipments averaged 12 documents. Adding further
complexity to the NZDB's global trade operations were frequent changes to
international shipping documents and regulations imposed by governments around
the world in an effort to protect their local dairy businesses. The NZDB
recognized that it could not continue to generate and update the necessary
country-specific shipping documents and trade regulations by simply adding
personnel.

    SOLUTION:  Our solutions were implemented in 1998 as the NZDB worldwide
standard for global trade management. The implementation of our solutions was
completed in less than six months.

    RESULTS:  Our solutions reduced the total number of source shipping
documents at the NZDB from over 5,000 to fewer than 300. In 1999, unlike
previous years, there were no late shipment dispatches caused by export
documentation errors. By utilizing our global trade solutions, the NZDB was able
to manage an estimated 300,000 ton increase in exports to approximately
1.3 million tons for the fiscal year ending in May 2000.

  RIGHTFREIGHT.COM

    CHALLENGE:  RightFreight.com is an Internet-based logistics and
transportation solutions provider that provides, among other things, reverse
auctions for contract and spot shipping. To differentiate its offering,
RightFreight.com needed to determine how to address global trade in its business
processes and offer more value-added services to its clients.

    SOLUTION:  In December 1999, RightFreight.com selected our solution to
provide embedded and hosted global trade management capabilities. Our
TradeSphere solutions allowed for fast time-to-market and provided mission
critical global trade functions and value-added services such as restricted
party screening, landed-cost information and international document generation.

    RESULTS:  In less than eight weeks, RightFreight.com was able to create a
web-based exchange that included global trade capabilities by leveraging our
global trade expertise and extensive research and development investment.

Competition

    Our market is intensely competitive, evolving and highly fragmented. We
expect the intensity of competition to increase in the future. We face
competition from third-party development efforts, consulting companies and
in-house development efforts. We expect that these parties will continue to be a
principal source of competition for the foreseeable future. Our principal
competitors by solution segment include:

    - Content aggregators such as Dun & Bradstreet and TradeCompass;

                                       50
<PAGE>
    - International trade logistics providers such as Capstan, Nextlinx, QRS
      Corporation and ClearCross;

    - Trade consultants such as management consulting firms, law firms and
      boutique consulting firms; and

    - Outsourcing service providers such as third party logistics providers,
      fourth party logistics providers and carriers.

    In addition, certain technology companies recently invested in or acquired
companies that we compete with or may compete with in the future. For example,
i2 recently invested in Capstan and QRS Corporation recently acquired Rockport,
a company focused on import trade management for the retail industry. Other
acquisitions may further consolidate our industry or create unforeseen
competition.

    We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market
include a referenceable client base, the breadth and depth of a given solution,
product quality and performance, client service, core technology, product
scalability and reliability, product features, the ability to implement
solutions and the value of a given solution. Although we believe our solutions
currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, our market is
relatively new and is evolving rapidly. We may not be able to maintain our
competitive position against current and potential competitors, especially those
with significantly greater financial, marketing, service, support, technical and
other resources.

Technology

    Our software solutions are based on leading edge technology, enabling us to
deliver high performance, scalable, flexible and interoperable solutions. Our
software solutions are built using a browser-based user interface, or UI, XML
integration technology and are also offered with a traditional Windows or
Motif-based UI. Our TradeSphere architecture supports the client demand for
configurability, electronic updates to country-specific content and plug-in
additions for new countries, functions and content.

    For our web-based solutions infrastructure, we utilize IBM's WebSphere,
HTML/DHTML, Java and Enterprise Java Beans, MQ Systems Integration Series and
XML. We incorporate a SmarteLink architecture that facilitates XML integration
and also leverages our repository of Forte-developed C++ applications allowing
interoperability with our web-based applications.

    Unique to the TradeSphere design and implementation approach is that both
content rules and configurations or installation-specific options are stored as
metadata within the solution's database. This approach supports a single source
solution which is able to operate on multiple hardware platforms, operating
environments and database platforms. Currently supported environments include
Windows NT and UNIX operating environments based on Sun Solaris, IBM AIX and
HP-UX platforms. Currently supported relational databases include either the
Oracle or SQL Server. Current user interfaces include a web-browser, Windows NT
and Motif. The system also supports multiple languages including double byte
languages.

                                       51
<PAGE>
    The following diagram describes our TradeSphere Architecture.

Diagram on Page 52:

    The diagram is titled "TradeSphere Architecture." The top of the diagram
starts with a thin, horizontal rectangle labeled "Web Browser." A thick, dark
line runs down this rectangle vertically to a smaller, thin, horizontal
rectangle labeled "Firewall." This dark line is labeled "Internet (HTTP, TCP/IP,
SSL)." Another thick, dark line connects down to a thin rectangle that runs the
length of the diagram labeled "Web Server." Right below this rectangle is a
thick rectangle running the length of the diagram and divided into three parts
horizontally. The top part of this thick rectangle is labeled "Application
Server--IBM WebSphere." The middle part of the thick rectangle is divided into
four equally sized rectangles labeled "Landed Cost Servlet," "Restricted Party
Servlet," "Importer Servlet," and "Exporter Servlet," respectively from left to
right. The bottom part of the thick rectangle is labeled "Servlet Engine." From
this thick rectangle runs four pairs of arrows (one arrow pointed up and the
other pointed down), connecting to a thin, horizontal rectangle labeled
"Firewall." The four pairs of arrows. labeled "TradeSphere Link--XML Gateway
Over TCP/ IP," are equidistant and imply a connection to the four "Servlet"
rectangles in the thick rectangle. From the "Firewall" rectangle, four more
pairs of arrows connect to four separate spheres. From left to right, the
spheres are labeled "Landed Cost Engine," "Restricted Party Engine," "Importer
Engine," and "Exporter Engine." The spheres in general are labeled "TradeSphere
Engines."

    This diagram illustrates that the TradeSphere architecture utilizes IBM
WebSphere at the middle layer and existing TradeSphere engines for business
logic processing on the backend. A typical transaction consists of an XML
message transmitted from the browser. The Web Server forwards the message to the
WebSphere application server where security authentication and authorization is
performed. When a user submits a request from his or her web browser to
TradeSphere, the servlet linked to the appropriate TradeSphere engine to handle
such request verifies that the user has the requisite security privileges to
access that engine and thereafter sends the request to the engine.

    Each of the TradeSphere engines performs a specific set of functions. The
landed cost engine uses the data parameters contained in the user's request to
perform landed cost calculations. The restricted party engine performs a
screening process to determine if the individual specified in the request is
included on the U.S. government's restricted party lists. The importer and
exporter engines allow users to edit shipping orders, modify trade data,
identify compliance issues with respect to required data and produce the
documentation required to import and export goods. The servlets communicate to
the engines through the TradeSphere Link-XML gateway for processing over a
TCP/IP socket, which is an Internet-based network protocol used for the transfer
of data messages. After the TradeSphere engine formulates a reply to the
servlet, the servlet then sends a XML response through the browser to the user.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights


    We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark
laws, confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and
protective contractual provisions contained in license agreements with
consultants, vendors and clients to protect our proprietary rights. However, at
least one firm has asserted that it is about to obtain a broad patent that might
read on the entire area of international trade calculations or a large portion
of commerce related to the use of computers in international trade. An
assessment of our risk related to this patent cannot be made until such patent
is issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. If and when such patent is
issued, we believe we will then be able to determine the technology and business
processes covered by it and its possible applicability to our business. We
cannot assure you that we will not be subject to lawsuits or other demands
arising out of this or any other patents that may exist now or in the future.


                                       52

    We have registered the trademark Vastera in the United States. We have also
filed federal trademark applications with respect to Global Trade Management,
Global Trade Value Chain, TradeSphere, TradeValue, TradeVantage, TradePrism,
Global eContent, TradeAxiom, Opening the World to eBusiness, Global Passport,
Smarte Commerce, Smarte Contents, Smarte Methods and SmartWare. The Vastera logo
is also a trademark of Vastera, Inc.

    We believe the strength of our trademarks and service marks benefits our
business and we intend to continue to protect our registered and common law
trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We have not
secured registration of all of our marks in the United States and have not
pursued registration in any foreign country.

    We also protect our proprietary rights by requiring employees to agree not
to reveal any proprietary information to our competitors and to sign a
confidentiality agreement. Employees also are required to execute a
non-competition agreement, which restricts them from working for a competitor
for one year after termination of employment with us. We may not, however,
obtain these agreements in every case.

    We incorporate technology from third parties into our software. We currently
have non-exclusive license agreements with Sun Microsystems and IBM for the use
of their technology in our global trade management solutions. The term of our
Sun Microsystems license is perpetual and the term of our IBM license expires on
June 30, 2006.

Employees

    As of June 30, 2000, we had 234 employees. With the completion of the Ford
acquisition in August 2000, we acquired 29 Ford employees and have access to
four additional employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective
bargaining agreement and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe
our relations with our employees are good.

Facilities

    Our principal administrative, sales, marketing, technical support and
product development facilities are located at our headquarters in Dulles,
Virginia. We currently occupy approximately 51,000 square feet of office space
in the Dulles facility under a lease that terminates on October 31, 2002. We
also lease office space for sales, marketing and consulting activities outside
of San Francisco, outside of Denver and outside of London in the United Kingdom.
In addition, pursuant to our arrangement with Ford, we maintain employees in
Dearborn, Michigan in office facilities that we may occupy until April 1, 2001
to manage and administer Ford's global customs unit. We believe these facilities
are suitable and provide the appropriate level of capacity for our current
operations.

Legal Proceedings

    We are not a party to any material legal proceedings.

    The exercise price per share of each option was equal to the fair market
value of the common stock on the grant date as determined by the board of
directors. We have never granted any stock appreciation rights. The potential
realizable values assume that the options' price per share was the fair market
value of the common stock on the date of grant. This potential realizable value
also assumes that the price of the stock appreciates at rates of 5% and 10%
compounded annually from the date the options were granted until their
expiration date. These numbers are calculated based on the requirements of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and do not reflect our estimate of future
stock price growth. Actual gains, if any, on stock option exercises will depend
on the future performance of the common stock and the date on which the options
are exercised.

public market for the common stock. The "Value of Unexercised In-the-Money

public offering price per share of $12.00, minus the per share exercise price,
multiplied by the number of shares underlying the option.

Compensation Plans

  1996 STOCK OPTION PLAN

    Our board of directors and stockholders adopted and approved the 1996 Stock
Option Plan on July 26, 1996. The 1996 Plan provides for grants of incentive
stock options, nonqualified stock options and stock awards to employees,
directors, consultants and

                                       58
<PAGE>
advisors. Members of the non-employee director administrative committee are not
eligible to receive options and awards. As of July 21, 2000, we may issue
options to purchase a maximum of 8,250,000 shares of common stock under the 1996
Plan. The board of directors may not increase the maximum number of shares
without obtaining the approval of the stockholders. No options or awards may be
granted under the 1996 Plan after July 26, 2006.

    The 1996 Plan may be administered by the board of directors or by a
committee of non-employee directors. The plan administrator has the power to
determine the persons to whom, the times at which, and the price at which the
options and awards shall be granted, and to determine the type of option or
award to be granted and the number of shares subject to options and awards.

    The plan administrator determines the option price for options. For a
nonqualified stock option, the price shall be at least equal to 85% of the fair
market value of the shares on the date the option is granted. For an incentive
stock option, the price shall be at least 100% of the fair market value on the
date the option is granted. If a recipient of an incentive stock option owns
shares possessing more than 10% of the total voting power of all classes of
stock, the option price shall be at least 110% of the fair market value on the
grant date.

    Options expire not later than 10 years after the date of the grant or five
years after the date of grant if the recipient owns shares possessing more than
10% of the combined voting power of all classes of stock. Options expire
90 days from the date the recipient's employment or service with Vastera
terminates or 12 months after disability or death, unless the grant agreement or
plan administrator provides otherwise. Options are not transferable during the
lifetime of the recipient, except that a nonqualified stock option may be
transferred pursuant to the terms of a domestic relation's order, or otherwise
as provided in the grant agreement.

    The plan administrator has the power to cause an option or options to become
immediately exercisable in full. For options granted prior to August 10, 1998,
the 1996 Plan also provides that all outstanding options will automatically
become immediately exercisable in the event of a merger, consolidation,
reorganization, liquidation, sale of substantially all corporate assets or the
acquisition of substantially all of our common stock by a third party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon an acquisition of the outstanding securities
representing 50% or more of the voting power of Vastera by a third party, a
change in a majority of the board or certain stockholder-approved mergers,
consolidations or liquidations, 50% of all unvested options granted under the
1996 Plan automatically become immediately exercisable.

    Awards of stock granted pursuant to the 1996 Plan shall be in the form of
written award agreements approved by the plan administrator. The plan
administrator may impose appropriate restrictions and forfeiture conditions on
stock awards.

    In the event that the outstanding shares are modified by reason of a
reorganization, merger, consolidation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
split, combination or exchange of shares, the plan administrator shall make
appropriate adjustments to the aggregate number of shares available under the
1996 Plan, the number of shares outstanding and price per share of outstanding
options.

  2000 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN

    Introduction.  Our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan is intended to serve as the
successor equity incentive program to our 1996 Plan. Our 2000 Plan was adopted
by our board on April 4, 2000 and approved by the stockholders on July 25, 2000.
Our 2000 Plan will become effective on the date the underwriting agreement for
this offering is signed. At that time, all options available for grant under the
1996 Plan will be transferred to our 2000 Plan, and no further

                                       59
<PAGE>
option grants will be made under that predecessor plan. The transferred options
will continue to be governed by their existing terms, unless our compensation
committee elects to extend one or more features of our 2000 Plan to those
options.

    Share Reserve. Under our 2000 Plan, 18,250,000 shares of common stock have
been authorized for issuance. This share reserve consists of the number of
shares we estimate will be carried over from our 1996 Plan, including the shares
subject to outstanding options thereunder, plus an additional increase of
approximately 10,000,000 shares. The number of shares of common stock reserved
for issuance under our 2000 Plan will automatically increase on the first
trading day in January each calendar year, beginning in calendar year 2001, by
an amount equal to 1.5% of the total number of shares of common stock
outstanding on the last trading day in December of the preceding calendar year,
but in no event will any such annual increase exceed 750,000 shares. In
addition, no participant in our 2000 Plan may be granted stock options,
separately exercisable stock appreciation rights and direct stock issuances for
more than 500,000 shares of common stock per calendar year.

    Equity Incentive Programs. Our 2000 Plan is divided into five separate
components:

    - the discretionary option grant program, under which eligible individuals
      in our employ or service may be granted options to purchase shares of
      common stock at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market
      value of those shares on the grant date;

    - the stock issuance program, under which such individuals may be issued
      shares of common stock directly, through the purchase of such shares at a
      price not less than 100% of their fair market value at the time of
      issuance or as a bonus tied to the attainment of performance milestones or
      the completion of a specified period of service;

    - the salary investment option grant program, under which our executive
      officers and other highly compensated employees may be given the
      opportunity to apply a portion of their base salary to the acquisition of
      special below-market value stock option grants;

    - the automatic option grant program, under which option grants will
      automatically be made at periodic intervals to our non-employee board
      members to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to
      100% of the fair market value of those shares on the grant date; and

    - the director fee option grant program, under which our non-employee board
      members may be given the opportunity to apply a portion of the annual
      retainer fee otherwise payable to them in cash each year to the
      acquisition of special below-market value option grants.

    Eligibility. The individuals eligible to participate in our 2000 Plan
include our officers and other employees, our non-employee board members and any
consultants we hire.

    Administration. The discretionary option grant program and the stock
issuance program will be administered by the compensation committee. This
committee will determine which eligible individuals are to receive option grants
or stock issuances under those programs, the time or times when such option
grants or stock issuances are to be made, the number of shares subject to each
such grant or issuance, the status of any granted option as either an incentive
stock option or a non-statutory stock option under the federal tax laws, the
vesting schedule to be in effect for the option grant or stock issuance and the
maximum term for which any granted option is to remain outstanding. The
compensation committee will also

                                       60
<PAGE>
have the exclusive authority to select the executive officers and other highly
compensated employees who may participate in the salary investment option grant
program in the event that program is activated for one or more calendar years.

    Plan Features. Our 2000 Plan will include the following features:

    - The exercise price for the shares of common stock subject to option grants
      made under our 2000 Plan may be paid in cash or in shares of common stock
      valued at fair market value on the exercise date. The option may also be
      exercised through a same-day sale program without any cash outlay by the
      optionee. In addition, the plan administrator may provide financial
      assistance to one or more optionees in the exercise of their outstanding
      options or the purchase of their unvested shares by allowing such
      individuals to deliver a full-recourse, interest-bearing promissory note
      in payment of the exercise price and any associated withholding taxes
      incurred in connection with such exercise or purchase.

    - The compensation committee will have the authority to cancel outstanding
      options under the discretionary option grant program, including options
      transferred from the 1996 Plan, in return for the grant of new options for
      the same or a different number of option shares with an exercise price per
      share based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the new
      grant date.

    - Stock appreciation rights are authorized for issuance under the
      discretionary option grant program. Such rights will provide the holders
      with the election to surrender their outstanding options for an
      appreciation distribution from us equal to the fair market value of the
      vested shares of common stock subject to the surrendered option, less the
      aggregate exercise price payable for those shares. Such appreciation
      distribution may be made in cash or in shares of common stock. None of the
      outstanding options under our 1996 Plan contain any stock appreciation
      rights.

    The 2000 Plan will include the following change in control provisions which
may result in the accelerated vesting of outstanding option grants and stock
issuances:

    - In the event that we are acquired by merger or asset sale, each
      outstanding option under the discretionary option grant program which is
      not to be assumed by the successor corporation will automatically
      accelerate in full, and all unvested shares under the discretionary option
      grant and stock issuance programs will immediately vest, except to the
      extent our repurchase rights with respect to those shares are to be
      assigned to the successor corporation.

    - The compensation committee will have complete discretion to structure one
      or more options under the discretionary option grant program so those
      options will vest as to all the option shares in the event those options
      are assumed in the acquisition but the optionee's service with us or the
      acquiring entity is subsequently terminated. The vesting of outstanding
      shares under the stock issuance program may be accelerated upon similar
      terms and conditions.

    - The compensation committee will also have the authority to grant options
      which will immediately vest in the event we are acquired, whether or not
      those options are assumed by the successor corporation.

    - The compensation committee may grant options and structure repurchase
      rights so that the shares subject to those options or repurchase rights
      will immediately vest in connection with a successful tender offer for
      more than 50% of our outstanding voting

                                       61
<PAGE>
      stock or a change in the majority of our board through one or more
      contested elections for board membership. Such accelerated vesting may
      occur either at the time of such transaction or upon the subsequent
      termination of the individual's service.

    Salary Investment Option Grant Program. In the event the compensation
committee elects to activate the salary investment option grant program for one
or more calendar years, each of our executive officers and other highly
compensated employees selected for participation may elect, prior to the start
of the calendar year, to reduce his or her base salary for that calendar year by
a specified dollar amount not less than $10,000 nor more than $50,000. Each
selected individual who files such a timely election will automatically be
granted, on the first trading day in January of the calendar year for which his
or her salary reduction is to be in effect, an option to purchase that number of
shares of common stock determined by dividing the salary reduction amount by
two-thirds of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the grant
date. The option will be exercisable at a price per share equal to one-third of
the fair market value of the option shares on the grant date. As a result, the
option will be structured so that the fair market value of the option shares on
the grant date less the exercise price payable for those shares will be equal to
the amount by which the optionee's salary is reduced under the program. The
option will become exercisable in a series of 12 equal monthly installments over
the calendar year for which the salary reduction is to be in effect.

    Automatic Option Grant Program. Under the automatic option grant program,
each individual who first becomes a non-employee board member at any time after
the completion of this offering will automatically receive an option grant for
45,000 shares on the date such individual joins the board, provided such
individual has not been in our prior employ.

    Each automatic grant will have an exercise price per share equal to the fair
market value per share of our common stock on the grant date and will have a
term of 10 years, subject to earlier termination following the optionee's
cessation of board service. The option will be immediately exercisable for all
of the option shares; however, we may repurchase, at the exercise price paid per
share, any shares purchased under the option which are not vested at the time of
the optionee's cessation of board service. The shares subject to each initial
45,000-share automatic option grant will vest in a series of three successive
annual installments upon the optionee's completion of each year of board service
over the three-year period measured from the grant date. These shares will
immediately vest in full upon certain changes in control or ownership or upon
the optionee's death or disability while a board member.

    Director Fee Option Grant Program. Should the director fee option grant
program be activated in the future, each non-employee board member will have the
opportunity to apply all or a portion of any cash retainer fee for the year to
the acquisition of a below-market value option grant. The option grant will
automatically be made on the first trading day in January in the year for which
the retainer fee would otherwise be payable in cash. The option will have an
exercise price per share equal to one-third of the fair market value of the
option shares on the grant date, and the number of shares subject to the option
will be determined by dividing the amount of the retainer fee applied to the
program by two-thirds of the fair market value per share of our common stock on
the grant date. As a result, the option will be structured so that the fair
market value of the option shares on the grant date less the exercise price
payable for those shares will be equal to the portion of the retainer fee
applied to that option. The option will become exercisable in a series of 12
equal monthly installments over the calendar year for which the election is to
be in effect. However, the option will become immediately exercisable for all
the option shares upon the optionee's death or disability while serving as a
board member.

                                       62
<PAGE>
    Our 2000 Plan will also have the following features:

    - Outstanding options under the salary investment and director fee option
      grant programs will immediately vest if we are acquired by a merger or
      asset sale or if there is a successful tender offer for more than 50% of
      our outstanding voting stock or a change in the majority of our board
      through one or more contested elections.

    - Limited stock appreciation rights will automatically be included as part
      of each grant made under the salary investment option grant program and
      the automatic and director fee option grant programs, and these rights may
      also be granted to one or more officers as part of their option grants
      under the discretionary option grant program. Options with this feature
      may be surrendered to us upon the successful completion of a hostile
      tender offer for more than 50% of our outstanding voting stock. In return
      for the surrendered option, the optionee will be entitled to a cash
      distribution from us in an amount per surrendered option share based upon
      the highest price per share of our common stock paid in that tender offer.

    The board may amend or modify the 2000 Plan at any time, subject to any
required stockholder approval. The 2000 Plan will terminate no later than April
3, 2010.

  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

    Introduction. Our Employee Stock Purchase Plan was adopted by the board of
directors on April 4, 2000 and approved by the stockholders on July 25, 2000.
The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The plan will become
effective immediately upon the signing of the underwriting agreement for this
offering. The plan is designed to allow our eligible employees and the eligible
employees of our participating subsidiaries to purchase shares of common stock,
at semi-annual intervals, with their accumulated payroll deductions.

    Share Reserve. 1,100,000 shares of our common stock will initially be
reserved for issuance. The reserve will automatically increase on the first
trading day in January each calendar year, beginning in calendar year 2001, by
an amount equal to 1.0% of the total number of outstanding shares of our common
stock on the last trading day in December in the prior calendar year. In no
event will any such annual increase exceed 500,000 shares.

    Offering Periods. The plan will have a series of successive offering
periods. Each offering period will have a duration of 24 months, unless
otherwise determined by the compensation committee. The initial offering period,
however, will start on the date the underwriting agreement for this offering is
signed and will end on the last business day in July 2002. The next offering
period will start on the first business day in August 2002.

    Eligible Employees. Individuals scheduled to work more than 20 hours per
week for more than five calendar months per year may join an offering period on
the start date of that period. However, employees may participate in only one
offering period at a time.

    Payroll Deductions. A participant may contribute up to 15% of his or her
cash earnings through payroll deductions, and the accumulated deductions will be
applied to the purchase of shares on each semi-annual purchase date. The
purchase price per share will be equal to 85% of the fair market value per share
on the participant's date of entry into the offering period or, if lower, 85% of
the fair market value per share on the semi-annual purchase date. Semi-annual
purchase dates will occur on the last business day of July and January each
year. However, a participant may not purchase more than 2,650 shares on any
purchase date, and not more than 275,000 shares may be purchased in total by all
participants on any purchase date. Our compensation committee will have the
authority to change these limitations for any subsequent offering period.

                                       63
<PAGE>
    Reset Feature. If the fair market value per share of our common stock on any
purchase date is less than the fair market value per share on the start date of
the two-year offering period, then that offering period will automatically
terminate, and a new two-year offering period will begin on the next business
day. All participants in the terminated offering will be transferred to the new
offering period.

    Change in Control. Should we be acquired by merger or sale of substantially
all of our assets or more than fifty percent of our voting securities, then all
outstanding purchase rights will automatically be exercised immediately prior to
the effective date of the acquisition. The purchase price will be equal to 85%
of the market value per share on the participant's date of entry into the
offering period in which an acquisition occurs or, if lower, 85% of the fair
market value per share immediately prior to the acquisition.

    Plan Provisions. The following provisions will also be in effect under the
plan:

    The plan will terminate no later than the last business day of July 2010.

    The board may at any time amend, suspend or discontinue the plan. However,
certain amendments may require stockholder approval.

  401(K) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

    We have adopted a tax-qualified employee savings and retirement plan, the
401(k) Profit Sharing Plan, for eligible U.S. employees. Eligible employees may
elect to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, subject to the
statutorily prescribed annual limit. We may make matching contributions on
behalf of all participants who have elected to make deferrals to the 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan in an amount determined annually by the Company. Any
contributions to the plan by the company or the participants are paid to a
trustee. The contributions made by the company, if any, are subject to a vesting
schedule; all other contributions are fully vested at all times. The 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan, and the accompanying trust, are intended to qualify under
Sections 401(k) and 501 of the Internal Revenue Code, so that contributions by
us or by employees and income earned (if any) on plan contributions are not
taxable to employees until withdrawn and contributions by us, if any, will be
deductible by the company when made. At the direction of each participant, the
trustee invests the contributions made to the 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan in any
number of investment options.

Limitations on Liability of Directors and Officers and Indemnification

    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  Our certificate of incorporation provides that our
officers and directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders
for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty, to the maximum
extent permitted by Delaware law. Under Delaware law, directors of a corporation
will not be personally liable for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary
duties as directors, except for:

    - Any breach of the duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders;

    - Acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional
      misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

    - Unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or
      redemptions; or

    - Any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal
      benefit.

                                       64
<PAGE>
    This limitation of liability does not apply to non-monetary remedies that
may be available, such as injunctive relief or rescission, nor does it relieve
our officers and directors from complying with federal or state securities laws.

    INDEMNIFICATION.  Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that
we shall indemnify our directors and executive officers, and may indemnify our
other corporate agents, to the fullest extent permitted by law. This provision
deters transactions not approved by the board, including transactions which may
offer a premium over market price for shares of common stock. An officer or
director shall not be entitled to indemnification if:

    - The officer or director did not act in good faith and in a manner
      reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to our best interests; or

    - The officer or director is subject to criminal action or proceedings and
      had reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful.

    We intend to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors and officers
in addition to the indemnification provided for in our certificate of
incorporation and our bylaws. These agreements, among other things, provide for
indemnification of our directors and officers for expenses specified in the
agreements, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts
incurred by any of these persons in any action or proceeding arising out of
these persons' services as a director or officer for us, any of our subsidiaries
or any other entity to which the person provides services at our request. We
believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain
qualified persons as directors and officers.

    In May 2000, MSD Portfolio L.P.-Investments and its affiliates, Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association of America and Technology Crossover Ventures
and its affiliates fully exercised their convertible preferred stock warrants.
In May 2000, as well, Battery Ventures III, L.P. exercised certain of its
convertible preferred stock warrants by way of a net issuance for 402,607 shares
of common stock on an as converted basis. The aggregate cash proceeds received
by Vastera for their exercises of convertible preferred stock warrants is
approximately $2.5 million.

    Battery Ventures III, L.P., MSD Portfolio L.P.-Investments and its
affiliate, Technology Crossover Ventures and its affiliates and Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association of America are considered each a holder of
more than 5% of our common stock. Mr. Barrett, one of our directors, is a

ownership of the securities held by their respective entities, except for their
respective pecuniary interests in their entities.

    At the time of the foregoing transactions, FedEx Corporation, RRE Investors,
L.P. and its affiliate and the Vertex Technology entities were considered each a
holder of more than 5% of our common stock. As a result of sales or additional
issuances of common stock, however, these entities no longer hold more than 5%
of our common stock.

Transaction with Ford Motor Company

    On July 14, 2000, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Vastera Solutions Services
Corporation, entered into a series of agreements with Ford that transfer the
responsibility of managing Ford's global trade processes to us. On August 29,
2000, we purchased Ford's global customs unit including its technologies and the
services of its employees by issuing 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to
Ford. The material agreements that define the relationship are the Global Trade
Services Agreement, the Stock Transfer Agreement, the License Agreement, the
Salaried Employee Secondment Agreement and the Employee Transfer Agreement.
Beginning in 2000, we expect to derive more than 10% of our annual revenues from
Ford. The principal terms of each of these agreements are described below.

  GLOBAL TRADE SERVICES AGREEMENT

    We have signed an agreement to provide the entire range of our service
offerings to Ford. Under this Agreement, we will administer and manage Ford's
global trade operations including supporting and managing Ford's import/export
customs operations, administering contracts between Ford and third party brokers
and freight forwarders, minimizing duties and customs fees and generally
automating and managing Ford's global trade management requirements.


    We will initially provide our suite of product and service offerings to Ford
in the United States. If we successfully implement our services in the United
States, we have the opportunity to provide our services to Ford divisions and
subsidiaries in other geographic regions around the world. Although this
agreement has an initial term of 10 years, commencing on August 1, 2003, either
party may terminate for convenience after providing the non-terminating party
one-year advance notice. Commencing on August 1, 2004 and continuing thereafter,
either party may terminate the agreement upon providing six-months' advance
written notice.


                                       68
<PAGE>

    As consideration for our service and product offerings, Ford has agreed to
pay us certain transaction fees, subject to certain guaranteed minimum
transaction revenues through 2004 totaling approximately $47.0 million. The
guaranteed minimum revenues are $4.5 million for 2000, $11.6 million for 2001,
2002 and 2003 and $6.8 million for 2004. The agreement also calls for
gainsharing revenues equal to 10% of annual cost savings up to a certain
threshold and 15% above that threshold. Cost savings will be calculated by
comparing the historical costs incurred by Ford with the future costs incurred
under our agreement with Ford. These costs include only duty, taxes, other
related government payments and customs broker costs paid by Ford.


  STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

    Under this agreement, we issued 8,000,000 shares of our common stock to
Ford. Ford has agreed to certain market standstill conditions effective until
July 1, 2004 that limit Ford from acquiring more than 27.5% of our outstanding
common stock without obtaining approval from our board of directors. If Ford
breaches these conditions, but owns no more than 30% of our outstanding common
stock, we will have the right to reduce Ford's ownership percentage by
purchasing any overage from Ford. If Ford acquires more than 30% of our
outstanding common stock, we will have the right to reduce Ford's ownership
percentage to 25%, by purchasing any such overage. The price per share to be
paid to Ford under these rights will be the lower of the per share price
contained in our final prospectus or the lowest price per share paid by Ford for
our shares. Ford has also agreed to limit the number of shares of our common
stock that it will sell into the market during the first four years following
the date of signing of this agreement. In addition, Ford is a party to our
investors' rights agreement providing Ford with certain registration rights. For
a more complete discussion of these rights, please see "Description of Capital
Stock--Registration Rights."

  LICENSE AGREEMENT

    To enable us to perform the services described in the Global Trade Services
Agreement, we will need access to certain of Ford's computer systems, trade
secrets, copyrights, patents, software and other intellectual property. Under
this agreement, Ford has agreed to license to us all of the intellectual
property we will require to commence performance. We have agreed to pay Ford a
monthly fee for the use of Ford's information technology and related support
services.

  SALARIED EMPLOYEE SECONDMENT AGREEMENT

    Under this agreement, which terminates on December 31, 2002, Ford has agreed
to assign to us selected employees that are performing its import/export customs
operations. In addition to reimbursing Ford for the direct salary and benefits
costs attributable to each seconded employee, we will pay Ford a per employee
fee for each employee that is assigned to us and is engaged in performing global
trade management services on Ford's behalf. These seconded Ford employees will
remain employees of Ford, but will receive instructions and supervision from us.
By way of another agreement, we have agreed to offer each assigned employee the
opportunity to terminate his or her employment with Ford and become an employee
of Vastera. Until such time as an assigned Ford employee elects to become a
Vastera employee, the employee shall remain on Ford's payroll system and receive
Ford's employee benefits.

                                       69
<PAGE>
    EMPLOYEE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

    Under this agreement, we agreed to offer employment to selected Ford
employees who were previously performing the import/export customs operations at
Ford. Of the approximately 110 employees of the global customs unit, we expect
75% of these employees to transfer to us from Ford. Currently, 29 of the 33
U.S.-based Ford employees have accepted employment with us. Select Ford
employees in the other geographic regions will be offered employment with us as
these regions are phased in. We will continue paying each employee who accepts
our offer a monthly base salary comparable to that paid by Ford and these
employees will then be eligible to receive all of the benefits normally offered
to Vastera employees. These employees will also continue to participate in
Ford's general retirement plan but will not be entitled to continue
participating in Ford's stock investment plan for salaried employees.

Transaction with Dell Products L.P.

    On June 28, 1996 and April 14, 1999, we entered into software license
agreements with Dell Products L.P., or Dell, an affiliate of Dell Computer
Corporation. The agreements provide certain nontransferable, perpetual licenses
to use our software products with the later agreement being for newer versions
of our software products. Michael S. Dell, the Chairman of the board of
directors and the Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, holds a
controlling ownership interest in MSD Portfolio L.P.-Investments and two of its
affiliates, significant investors in Vastera, Inc. For 1999, we received a total
of approximately $595,000 for license, maintenance and support, and consulting
services fees related to our software products from Dell Products L.P. under
these agreements.

Transaction with FedEx Corporation

    In June 2000, FedEx Corporation sold all of its stock and warrant holdings
in Vastera to affiliates of Technology Crossover Ventures. FedEx has also
notified us of its intent to terminate its development, marketing and
professional services agreements with us, effective as of September 1, 2000.
FedEx, has not, however, terminated its software license and services agreement
with us and, as such, will remain a customer of ours. In 1999, we received
approximately $1.6 million under all of our agreements with FedEx.

Arms Length Transactions

    All past and future transactions with our officers, directors, principal
stockholders or affiliates have been and will be approved by a majority of the
independent and disinterested members of the board of directors or, if required
by law, a majority of disinterested stockholders, and have been or will be on
terms no less favorable to us than could be obtained from unaffiliated third
parties.

                             PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS

    The following table sets forth information as of June 30, 2000 regarding the
beneficial ownership of our common stock by:

    - each person or entity who is known by us to own beneficially more than 5%
      of our outstanding common stock;

    - each of our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table;

    - each of our directors; and

    - all directors and executive officers as a group.

    Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission. In computing the number of shares
beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person,
shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person that
are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days after
June 30, 2000, are deemed outstanding, while the shares are not deemed
outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person.
Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes below, the persons and entities
named in the table have sole voting or investment power with respect to all
shares beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable.

    The number and percentage of shares beneficially owned are based on the
aggregate of (i) 28,457,508 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30,
2000, assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into
common stock and the issuance of 8,000,000 shares of common stock to Ford on
August 29, 2000 in connection with our acquisition of Ford's global customs
unit, and (ii) 6,000,000 shares of common stock issued in this offering.

    Unless otherwise indicated, the principal address of each of the
stockholders below is c/o Vastera, Inc., 45025 Aviation Drive, Suite 200,
Dulles, Virginia 20166.

                          DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

    The following description of our common stock and preferred stock and the
relevant provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
amended and restated bylaws as will be in effect upon the closing of this
offering are summaries and are qualified by reference to these documents. Forms
have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as exhibits to our
registration statement, of which this prospectus forms a part.

    Upon the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist
of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share.

Common Stock

    As of June 30, 2000, there were 6,632,691 shares of common stock outstanding
held of record by 57 stockholders. Based upon the number of shares outstanding
as of that date and giving effect to the automatic conversion of all previously
outstanding convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock and the
issuance of 8,000,000 shares of common stock issued to Ford on August 29, 2000
in connection with our acquisition of Ford's global customs unit and assuming no
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option and no exercise of
outstanding options after June 30, 2000, there will be approximately 34,457,508
shares of common stock outstanding at the closing of this offering.

    Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters
submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of common stock do not have
cumulative voting rights. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
dividends as may be declared from time to time by the board of directors out of
funds legally available for the payment of dividends, subject to the preferences
that apply to any outstanding preferred stock. See "Dividend Policy." Upon a
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Vastera, the holders of common stock
are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of
liabilities and after giving effect to the liquidation preference of any
outstanding preferred stock. The common stock has no preemptive or conversion
rights and no additional subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking
fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common
stock are fully paid and nonassessable. The shares issued in this offering will
be fully paid and nonassessable.

Preferred Stock

    Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the board
of directors, without stockholder action, to designate and issue from time to
time shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The board of directors may
designate the price, rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each
series of preferred stock, which may be greater than the rights of the common
stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any
shares of preferred stock upon the rights of holders of common stock until the
board of directors determines the specific rights of the preferred stock.
However, possible effects of issuing preferred stock with voting and conversion
rights include:

    - Restricting dividends on common stock;

    - Diluting the voting power of common stock;

    - Impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock;

    - Delaying or preventing a change of control of Vastera without stockholder
      action; and

    - Harming the market price of common stock.

                                       74
<PAGE>
    Upon the closing of this offering, no shares of our preferred stock will be
outstanding. We have no present plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Warrants

    As of June 30, 2000, we had outstanding the following warrants to purchase
our stock:

Options

    In 1996, Vastera adopted the 1996 Stock Option Plan. As of June 30, 2000,
8,250,000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance to employees at the
discretion of our board of directors under the 1996 Plan and there were
1,328,477 shares of common stock available for future grant under the 1996 Plan.
The exercise price of all options outstanding at June 30, 2000 under the 1996
Plan range from $1.00 to $9.33 with a weighted average exercise price of $3.56
and these options are exercisable in the aggregate for 6,504,552 shares of
common stock. Please see "Management--Employee Benefit Plans" for a detailed
description of the plan.

Registration Rights

    Upon closing of this offering, the holders of 22,511,421 shares of common
stock, assuming the exercise of all outstanding convertible preferred stock
warrants and the conversion into common stock of the convertible preferred stock
issued upon the exercise of the warrants, will be entitled to demand
registration rights requiring us to register the sale of their shares under the
Securities Act of 1933, under the terms of an agreement between us and the
holders of these shares. The holders of 40% or more of these shares are entitled
to demand that Vastera register their shares under the Securities Act, subject
to various limitations. Vastera is not required to effect more than two
registrations pursuant to these demand registration rights. In addition, these
holders are entitled to piggyback registration rights with respect to the
registration of their shares under the Securities Act, subject to various
limitations. Further, at any time after Vastera becomes eligible to file a
registration statement on Form S-3, these holders may require Vastera to file
registration statements under the Securities Act on Form S-3 with respect to
their shares of common stock. These registration rights are subject to certain
conditions and limitations, among them the right of the underwriters of an
offering to limit the number of shares of common stock held by these holders
with registration rights to be included in a registration. Vastera is generally
required to bear all of the expenses of all of these registrations, except
underwriting discounts and selling commissions. Registration of any of the
shares of common stock held by these holders with registration rights would
result in shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the
Securities Act immediately upon effectiveness of such registration.

Delaware Anti-Takeover Law and Provisions in Our Charter and Bylaws

  DELAWARE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTE

    We are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In
general, these provisions prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in any
business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years
following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless
the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder is approved
in a manner presented in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Generally, a "business combination" is defined to include mergers, asset sales
and other transactions resulting in financial benefit to a stockholder. In
general, an "interested stockholder" is a person who, together with affiliates
and associates, owns, or within three years, did own, 15% or more of a
corporation's voting stock.

  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

    Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that:

    - Our board of directors may issue, without further action by the
      stockholders, up to 10,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;

    - Any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly
      called annual or special meeting and not by a consent in writing;

    - Our board of directors shall be divided into three classes, with each
      class serving for a term of three years;

    - Vacancies on the board, including newly created directorships, can be
      filled by a majority of the directors then in office; and

    - Our directors may be removed only for cause.

  BYLAWS

    Our amended and restated bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to bring
business before an annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for
election as directors at an annual meeting of stockholders, must provide timely
notice to us in writing. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received
at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days
prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
stockholders. In the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is
not within 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary date, in order to be
timely notice from the stockholder must be received:

    - not earlier than 120 days prior to the annual meeting of stockholders; and

    - not later than 90 days prior to the annual meeting of stockholders or the
      tenth day following the date on which notice of the annual meeting was
      made public.

    In the case of a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of
electing directors, notice by the stockholder, in order to be timely, must be
received:

    - not earlier than 120 days prior to the special meeting; and

    - not later than 90 days prior to the special meeting or the close of
      business on the tenth day following the day on which public disclosure of
      the date of the special meeting was made.

                                       76
<PAGE>
    Our amended and restated bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and
content of a stockholder's notice. These provisions may preclude stockholders
from bringing matters before an annual or special meeting of stockholders, from
making nominations for directors at an annual or special meeting of stockholders
or from making nominations for directors at an annual or special meeting of
stockholders. In addition, a two-thirds supermajority vote of stockholders will
be required to amend our amended and restated bylaws.

    The provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and
our amended and restated bylaws are intended to enhance the likelihood of
continuity and stability in the composition of the board of directors and in the
policies formulated by the board of directors and to discourage certain types of
transactions that may involve an actual or threatened change of control of
Vastera. These provisions also are designed to reduce our vulnerability to an
unsolicited proposal for a takeover of Vastera that does not contemplate the
acquisition of all of its outstanding shares or an unsolicited proposal for the
restructuring or sale of all or parts of Vastera. These provisions, however,
could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a
change in control of Vastera. They may also have the effect of preventing
changes in our management.

    The transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is EquiServe Trust

                        SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE

    Sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market following
the offering could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and
adversely affect our ability to raise capital at a time and on terms favorable
to us.

    Of the 34,457,508 shares to be outstanding after the offering,
6,000,000 shares of common stock will be freely tradable unless they are
purchased by our "affiliates," as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the
Securities Act. The remaining shares, assuming no exercise of outstanding
options and warrants, will be eligible for sale in the public market as follows:

Rule 144

    In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has
beneficially owned shares for at least one year, including an "affiliate," as
that term is defined in the Securities Act, is entitled to sell, within any
three-month period, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:

    - one percent of the then outstanding shares of our common stock
      (34,457,508 shares immediately following the offering), or

    - the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding
      filing of notice of such sale.

    Sales under Rule 144 are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions,
notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us.
A shareholder who is deemed not to have been an "affiliate" of ours at any time
during the 90 days preceding a sale, and who has beneficially owned restricted
shares for at least two years, would be entitled to sell such shares under
Rule 144(k) without regard to the volume, limitations, manner of sale provisions
or public information requirements. For purposes of Rule 144, an "affiliate" of
an issuer is a person that, directly or indirectly through one or more
intermediaries, controls, or is controlled by or is under common control with,
such issuer. All of our affiliates have agreed to further restrict their shares
by entering into lock-up arrangements discussed above.

Rule 701

    In general, under Rule 701 of the Securities Act as currently in effect,
each of our directors, officers, employees, consultants or advisors who
purchased shares from us before the date of this prospectus in connection with a
compensatory stock plan or other written compensatory agreement is eligible to
resell such shares 90 days after the effective date of this prospectus in
reliance on Rule 144, but without compliance with certain restrictions,
including the holding period, contained in Rule 144.

intend to file registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act of
1933 covering shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our 1996 Plan,
our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Based on the

Plan, our 2000 Plan and our 2000 Stock Purchase Plan, the registration
statements on Form S-8 will cover 23,250,000 shares. The Form S-8 registration
statements will become effective immediately upon filing, whereupon, subject to
the satisfaction of applicable exercisability periods, Rule 144 volume
limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements with the
underwriters referred to above, shares of common stock to be issued upon
exercise of outstanding options granted pursuant to our 1996 Plan, our 2000 Plan
and our 2000 Stock Purchase Plan (to the extent that such shares were not held
by affiliates) will be available for immediate resale in the public market.

Lock-up Agreement

    Each of our officers and directors, and substantially all of our
stockholders and holders of options and warrants to purchase our stock have
agreed not to sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock for a
period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus without the prior written
consent of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Transfers or dispositions can be made
during the lock-up period in the case of gifts or for estate planning purposes
where the donee signs a lock-up agreement. Upon the expiration of these lock-up
agreements, additional shares will be available for sale in the public market.

Registration Rights

    After this offering, the holders of 22,511,421 shares of our common stock,
assuming the exercise of all outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants
and the conversion into common stock of the convertible preferred stock issued
upon the exercise of the warrants, will be entitled to certain rights with
respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. See
"Description of Capital Stock--Registration Rights." After any such registration
of these shares, such shares will be freely tradeable without restriction under
the Securities Act. These sales could cause the market price of our common stock
to decline.

    Subject to the terms and conditions of the underwriting agreement, the
underwriters named below, through their representatives Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., Chase Securities Inc. and Banc of America Securities LLC, have
severally agreed to purchase from Vastera the following respective number of
shares of common stock at a public offering price less the underwriting
discounts and commissions set forth on the cover page of this prospectus:

                                                                  =======
</TABLE>

    The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several
underwriters to purchase the shares of common stock offered hereby are subject
to certain conditions precedent and that the underwriters will purchase all
shares of the common stock offered hereby, other than those covered by the
over-allotment option described below, if any of these shares are purchased.

    The underwriters propose to offer the shares of common stock to the public
at the public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus and to
dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of $          per
share under the public offering price. The underwriters may allow, and these
dealers may re-allow, a concession of not more than $          per share to
other dealers. After the initial public offering, representatives of the
underwriters may change the offering price and other selling terms.

    We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable not later than
30 days after the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to 900,000 additional
shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting
discounts and commissions set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. The
underwriters may exercise this option only to cover over-allotments made in
connection with the sale of the common stock offered hereby. To the extent that
the underwriters exercise this option, each of the underwriters will become
obligated, subject to conditions, to purchase approximately the same percentage
of additional shares of common stock as the number of shares of common stock to
be purchased by it in the above table bears to the total number of shares of
common stock offered hereby. We will be obligated, pursuant to the option, to
sell these additional shares of common stock to the underwriters to the extent
the option is exercised. If any additional shares of common stock are purchased,
the underwriters will offer the additional shares on the same terms as those on
which the 6,000,000 shares are being offered.

    The underwriting fee is equal to the public offering price per share of
common stock less the amount paid by the underwriters to us per share of common
stock. The underwriting fee is   % of the initial public offering price. We have
agreed to pay the underwriters the following fees, assuming either no exercise
or full exercise by the underwriters of the underwriters' over-allotment option:

<PAGE>
    In addition, we estimate that our share of the total expenses of this
offering, excluding underwriting discounts and commissions, will be
approximately $3,000,000.

    We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against some specified types of
liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute
to payments the underwriters may be required to make in respect of any of these
liabilities.

    Each of our officers and directors, and substantially all of our
stockholders and holders of options and warrants to purchase our stock, have
agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, or enter
into any transaction that is designed to, or could be expected to, result in the
disposition of any shares of our common stock or other securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of our common stock or
derivatives of our common stock owned by these persons prior to this offering or
common stock issuable upon exercise of options or warrants held by these persons
for a period of 180 days after the effective date of the registration statement
of which this prospectus is a part without the prior written consent of Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. This consent may be given at any time without public
notice. Transfers or dispositions can be made during the lock-up period in the
case of gifts or for estate planning purposes where the donee signs a lock-up
agreement. We have entered into a similar agreement with the representatives of
the underwriters, except that without such consent we may grant options and sell
shares pursuant to our 1996 Stock Option Plan, our 2000 Stock Incentive Plan and
our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and may issue shares of our common stock in
connection with a strategic partnering transaction or in exchange for all or
substantially all of the equity or assets of a company in connection with a
merger or acquisition. There are no agreements between the representatives and
any of our stockholders or affiliates releasing them from these lock-up
agreements prior to the expiration of the 180-day period. Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. currently does not intend to release any shares subject to these
agreements, although such a release may be given at any time in the sole
discretion of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.

    The representatives of the underwriters have advised us that the
underwriters do not intend to confirm sales to any account over which they
exercise discretionary authority.

    In order to facilitate the offering of our common stock, the underwriters
may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the
market price of our common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may over-allot
shares of our common stock in connection with this offering, thus creating a
short position in our common stock for their own account. A short position
results when an underwriter sells more shares of common stock than that
underwriter is committed to purchase. Additionally, to cover these
over-allotments or to stabilize the market price of our common stock, the
underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of our common stock in the open
market. Finally, the representatives, on behalf of the underwriters, may also
reclaim selling concessions allowed to an underwriter or dealer if the
underwriting syndicate repurchases shares distributed by that underwriter or
dealer. Any of these activities may maintain the market price of our common
stock at a level above that which might otherwise prevail in the open market.
These transactions may be effected on the Nasdaq National Market or otherwise.
The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and, if
commenced, may end any of these activities at any time.


    At our request, the underwriters have reserved for sale, at the initial
public offering price, up to 780,051 shares for our vendors, employees, family
members of employees, clients and other third parties. Pursuant to a prior
agreement, the holders of shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock are
entitled to purchase in this offering $3.0 million of common stock. The number
of shares of our common stock available for sale to the general public will


                                       81
<PAGE>

be reduced to the extent these reserved shares are purchased. Any reserved
shares that are not purchased by these persons will be offered by the
underwriters to the general public on the same basis as the other shares in this
offering.



    In February 2000, we sold shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock
in a private placement at a price of $10.83 per share. In this private
placement, BT Investment Partners, Inc., an affiliate of Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., purchased 46,168 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock
for an aggregate purchase price of $499,999. Additionally, Hambrecht & Quist
California, H&Q Employee Venture Fund 2000, L.P., Access Technology Partners,
L.P. and Access Technology Partners Brokers Fund, L.P., affiliates of Chase
Securities Inc., purchased 6,186 shares, 2,308 shares, 36,935 shares and 739
shares, respectively, of Series E convertible preferred stock for an aggregate
purchase price of $499,999. In July 2000, Hambrecht & Quist California
transferred a total of 3,878 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock
to three individuals who at the time of this transfer were employees of Chase
H&Q, one of the underwriters in this offering. BT Investment Partners, Inc. and
the above-mentioned affiliates of Chase Securities Inc. will each agree with us
not to sell, transfer, assign, pledge or hypothecate, other than to an entity
that is participating in the offering or an officer or partner thereof, any
shares of our common stock issued with respect to such shares of Series E
convertible preferred stock for one year after the date of this offering.

public offering price are:

    - information set forth in this prospectus and otherwise available to the
      representatives;

    - prevailing market conditions;

    - the market capitalization and stage of development of other companies that
      we and the representatives of the underwriters believe to be comparable to
      our business; and

    - estimates of our business potential.

                                 OTHER MATTERS

    On March 26, 1999, our board of directors dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP as its independent accountants. From our inception through March 26, 1999,
the former auditors did not disagree with us on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to their satisfaction, would have
caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial
statements for such years. During the period from our inception to the date of
their dismissal, there have been no reportable events as defined in
Regulation S-K Item 304(a)(1)(iv). In response to our request,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has furnished us with a letter addressed to the
Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP agrees with the above statements. We have filed a copy of such letter dated
April 5, 2000 as Exhibit 16 to the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part.

    On March 26, 1999, our board of directors retained Arthur Andersen LLP as
our independent public accountants. Prior to retaining Arthur Andersen LLP, we
had not consulted with Arthur Andersen LLP on any accounting, auditing or
reporting matter.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Vastera, Inc.:

    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Vastera, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its subsidiary as of December 31,
1998 and 1999, and the related consolidated statements of operations and changes
in stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Vastera, Inc. and its
subsidiary as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.

    As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has given retroactive effect to the change in accounting for software license
revenues.

                 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. The Company:

Nature of the Business

    Vastera, Inc. ("Vastera" or the "Company") is a leading provider of
web-based solutions for global trade management and was incorporated in Virginia
in November 1991 under the name Export Software International, Inc. The Company
reincorporated in Delaware in July 1996 and changed its name to Vastera, Inc. in
June 1997.

    The Company's offerings include a library of global trade content, web-based
software solutions and management consulting and managed services. Managed
services range from management of a specific global trade function to providing
complete management of a client's global trade operations. Our customers utilize
these offerings to manage their global trade processes. Global trade involves
the shipment of goods between countries and the management of information and
business processes to complete shipment.

    The Company's operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,
including among others, uncertainties relating to product development, rapidly
changing technology, current and potential competitors with greater financial,
technological, production, and marketing resources, dependence on key management
personnel, limited protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights,
uncertainty of future profitability and possible fluctuations in financial
results.

Acquisitions

    On January 31, 1999, the Company acquired Deltac Limited, located in Wales,
United Kingdom, a privately owned company and provider of international trade
consulting. The purchase method of accounting has been applied to this
acquisition, and accordingly, the results of operations of Deltac are included
in the Company's operations from the date of acquisition. In connection with
this transaction, the Company changed the name of Deltac to Vastera, Ltd.

    The shareholders of Deltac received $100,000 in cash and 189,000 shares of
common stock of Vastera, valued at $409,000, in exchange for all of the
outstanding common stock of Deltac. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the net assets of Deltac was approximately $512,000. This amount
was allocated to goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over
five years.

    On June 1, 1999, the Company acquired Quantum Consulting Associates, Inc.,
located in Denver, Colorado, a privately owned international trade consulting
company. The purchase method of accounting has been applied to this acquisition,
and accordingly, the results of operations of Quantum are included in the
Company's operations from the date of acquisition.

    The shareholders of Quantum received approximately $439,000 in cash and
567,000 shares of common stock of Vastera, valued at approximately $1,511,000,
in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of Quantum. The excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of Quantum was
approximately $1,880,000. This amount was allocated to goodwill and is being
amortized on a straight-line basis over five years.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiary, Vastera, Ltd., from the date of acquisition.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Unaudited Interim Financial Information

    The consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2000 and for the six
months ended June 30, 1999 and 2000 and all related disclosures are unaudited.
These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the audited consolidated financial statements and include all
adjustments, including all normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for
a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the
interim period ended June 30, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of results to
be expected for the entire fiscal year or future periods.

Unaudited Pro Forma Balance Sheet Information

    The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information is being presented to show
the mandatory conversion of all shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock
outstanding at June 30, 2000 into shares of common stock upon a qualified
initial public offering. All of the Company's preferred stock will automatically
convert into shares of common stock if the initial public offering is
consummated under terms presently anticipated.

Use of Estimates

    The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

           NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

    The Company's revenues consist of subscription/transaction revenues and
services revenues.

  SUBSCRIPTION/TRANSACTION REVENUES

    Subscription/transaction revenues consist of subscription-based revenues,
transaction-based revenues and perpetual software license revenues. The Company
recognizes revenue in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition."

    Subscription-based revenues are revenues derived from arrangements in which
our clients subscribe to our software products and services. Revenues are
recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription arrangements typically
range from three to five years.

    Transaction-based revenues are revenues derived from agreements which
provide for transaction fees based on usage of our software products and
services. Revenues are recognized as transactions occur.

    Perpetual software license revenues are derived from the sales of perpetual
software licenses and the related maintenance contract. Maintenance contracts
include the right to unspecified enhancements on a when-and-if available basis,
ongoing support and content update services. The content updates provided under
maintenance arrangements are significant and frequent and thus the entire
arrangement is in substance a subscription. Revenues from perpetual software
license sales are recognized ratably over the estimated economic life of the
product. We have estimated the life of the product is three years, which is
consistent with the historical periods between major upgrades to the
functionality and architecture of our products such that we would charge all
customers a new fee to migrate to the new version. Revenues from maintenance
contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term, typically one year.

  SERVICES REVENUES

    Services revenues are derived from implementation, management consulting and
training services. Services are performed on a time and materials basis or under
fixed price arrangements and are recognized as the services are performed or
using percentage of completion.

Accounting Change

    In 1999, the Company changed its method of recognizing revenue under
software license arrangements. In accordance with SOP 97-2, the Company has
accounted for software licenses as a subscription arrangement over the term of
the contract or the estimated economic life of the product (three years) if the
contract term is not specified. Prior to the change, license fees were
recognized upon delivery of the software. The new method of accounting for
software license fees was adopted since the content updates provided under
maintenance arrangements are significant and frequent and thus the entire
arrangement is in substance a subscription. The financial statements of prior
years have been restated to apply the new method retroactively.

Software Development Costs

    In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or
Otherwise Marketed," software development costs are expensed as incurred until
technological feasibility has been established, at which time such costs are
capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. To
date, the establishment of technological feasibility of the Company's products
and general release of such software have substantially coincided. As a result,
software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been
insignificant, and therefore, the Company has not capitalized any software
development costs.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

    The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

    SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,"
requires disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments,
whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to
estimate that value. SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all
nonfinancial instruments from these disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the
aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of
the Company. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets
approximate the fair value for cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, the line of credit and capital lease obligations.

Accounts Receivable

    As of December 31, 1998, 1999, and June 30, 2000, the Company had
approximately $225,000, $285,000, and $1,228,000, respectively, of unbilled
revenue included in accounts receivable. Unbilled amounts primarily relate to
services performed but not yet billed under fixed price arrangements.

           NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Investments

    The Company accounts for investments in accordance with SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." In 1998, the
Company began using its existing cash on hand to invest in certain debt
securities. The Company considers all of its investments as of December 31, 1998
and 1999, to be available-for-sale.

    As of December 31, 1998, there were no material unrealized gains and losses.
As of December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, the Company recognized approximately
($41,000) and $49,000, respectively of net unrealized gains (losses) on
investments in debt securities as a component of stockholders' equity.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and accounts receivable.
The Company limits the amount of investment exposure in any one financial
instrument and does not have any foreign currency investments. The Company sells
products and services to customers across several industries throughout the
world without requiring collateral. However, the Company routinely assesses the
financial strength of its customers and maintains allowances for anticipated
losses.

    There were no customers that represented 10 percent or more of accounts
receivable as of December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 1999, one customer
accounted for 16 percent of total accounts receivable. As of June 30, 2000, one
customer accounted for 11 percent of total accounts receivable.

Depreciation and Amortization

    Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Assets acquired under
capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms
of the leases. Goodwill related to the 1999 acquisitions is being amortized
using the straight-line method over five years.

Long-Lived Assets

    The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment
and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. To determine
recoverability of its long-lived assets, the Company evaluates the future,
undiscounted, net cash flows compared to the carrying amount of the assets.

Income Taxes

    Deferred taxes are provided utilizing the liability method as prescribed by
SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," whereby deferred tax assets are
recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable
temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
rates

           NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

on the date of enactment. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Net Loss Per Common Share

    Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing
net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share includes
the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to
issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. As of
December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, options to purchase approximately 4,728,000
and 6,505,000 shares of common stock, respectively; and warrants to purchase
approximately 1,248,000 and 446,000 shares, respectively, of redeemable
convertible preferred stock were outstanding. Due to the anti-dilutive nature of
the options and warrants there is no effect on the calculation of
weighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share. As a result, the basic
and diluted loss per share amounts are identical.

    Unaudited pro forma loss per common share is computed using the pro forma
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Pro forma
weighted-average common shares include the assumed conversion of all outstanding
convertible preferred stock into common stock.

Foreign Currency Translation

    The Company uses the local currency as its functional currency in all
foreign locations. Assets and liabilities are translated into U. S. dollars as
of the balance sheet date. Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated
at the average exchange rates in effect during each period. If material, gains
and losses resulting from translation are included in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in stockholders' equity. Net gains or losses resulting from
foreign currency exchange transactions are included in the consolidated
statements of operations. There were no material gains or losses resulting from
translation or foreign currency exchange transactions for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999. The Company incurred a loss of approximately
$59,000 from translation of its foreign subsidiary's assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars for the six months ended June 30, 2000. There were no material
gains and losses from foreign currency exchange transactions for the same
period.

Comprehensive Loss

    As of December 31, 1997 and 1998, the Company did not have any material
items of comprehensive loss other than net loss, as the components of
accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial to the financial
statements. As of December 31, 1999, accumulated other comprehensive loss
includes unrealized gains and losses on investments. As of June 30, accumulated
other comprehensive loss includes unrealized gains and losses on investments and
foreign currency translation adjustments.

    As of December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, goodwill of approximately
$2,079,000 and 1,840,000, respectively, relates to the Company's 1999
acquisitions. Accumulated amortization as of December 31, 1999 and June 30,
2000, was approximately $313,000 and $552,000, respectively.

4.  Long-Term Debt:

Line of Credit

    In June 1997, the Company received a $1,000,000 convertible bridge loan (the
"Bridge Loan") from an equity investor (the "Investor"). The loan had an
interest rate of 10 percent. In August 1997, the $1,000,000 principal bridge
loan was converted into approximately 270,000 shares of Series C redeemable
convertible preferred stock.

    On April 28, 1998, the Company obtained a line of credit from a bank for
$2,500,000 with a $500,000 sublimit for equipment purchases, subject to
borrowing base restrictions. During 1998 the equipment line of credit was
increased to $1,000,000. The line bears interest at prime plus 1.25 percent. The
line of credit is collateralized by the first lien on all corporate assets,
including intangible assets. As of December 31, 1998, there were no borrowings
outstanding under this line of credit. The Company terminated this line of
credit in March 1999.

    In March 1999, the Company negotiated a $2,500,000 secured revolving credit
facility and a $1,500,000 equipment line of credit with a different bank. The
line bears interest at the prime rate plus .75 percent for the secured revolving
credit facility and the prime rate plus .85 percent for the equipment line of
credit. In September 1999, the equipment line was increased to $3,000,000. As of
December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, the outstanding balance under the equipment
line was approximately $1,723,000 and $3,302,000, respectively, and there were
no amounts outstanding under the revolving line of credit. The revolving line of
credit expires on September 5, 2000.

    The equipment line of credit has two interest-only payment periods. Amounts
borrowed until March 15, 2000 are subject to interest-only payments. After this
date, the Company is required to make principal and interest payments to repay
these borrowings over three years. The second interest-only payment period is
applicable to borrowings from March 16, 2000 to

September 15, 2000. After September 15, 2000, the Company is required to make
principal and interest payments to repay the borrowings from the second
interest-only period over three years.

    The terms of the line of credit require the Company to comply with certain
financial covenants. As of December 31, 1999, the Company was in violation of
these covenants. On February 3, 2000, the bank granted the Company a waiver of
past covenant violations and waived its right to call the line of credit for
these covenant violations.

    On March 31, 2000, the Company amended the existing financial covenants and
increased the equipment line of credit to $4,800,000. Pursuant to an amendment
dated June 19, 2000, the Company's financial covenants were clarified by the
bank to exclude all non-cash charges from the calculations of the covenants. The
most restrictive of the amended financial covenants is that the Company's
operating losses, as defined, will not exceed $5,000,000 for the second, third
and fourth fiscal quarters of 2000 and for the first fiscal quarter in 2001, and
$2,000,000 in any quarter thereafter, and, beginning in the first quarter of
2002, the Company is not permitted to have two consecutive quarters with
operating losses. Other financial covenants, which were amended, require that
the Company maintain minimum tangible net worth, as defined, as follows (in
thousands):

Capital Lease Obligations

    The Company leases office equipment under various non-cancelable capital
leases. The Company obtained an equipment leasing arrangement in the aggregate
of $1,400,000 in 1997 and an additional $250,000 in 1998 from a lending
institution (the "Lender"). Amounts borrowed from the equipment leasing
arrangement are due over 36- to 48-month repayment periods and are
collateralized by the Company's software product.

    In connection with the capital lease arrangement from the Lender and the
Bridge Loan from the Investor during 1997, the Company issued the Lender and the
Investor warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 7,000, 5,000, and
18,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, Series B preferred stock, and
Series C preferred stock, respectively. The fair value of these warrants was
immaterial and, accordingly, have not been accounted for separately in the
consolidated financial statements.

    As of December 31, 1998 and 1999 and June 30, 2000, capital lease
obligations outstanding were approximately $1,388,000, $994,000 and $781,000,
respectively. Property and equipment includes approximately $1,914,000,
$1,798,000 and $1,798,000 of equipment under

Series C-1 warrants were valued at approximately $477,000. The Company paid
approximately $52,000 in issuance costs, which has been reflected as a reduction
in the proceeds from the sale of Series C.

    On February 12, 1998, and May 28, 1998, pursuant to stock purchase
agreements with various new investors, the Company issued approximately 540,000
and 68,000 shares of Series C and warrants to purchase approximately 95,000 and

respectively. The warrants were valued at approximately $171,000.

    On November 24, 1998, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with various
investors, the Company issued approximately 2,461,000 shares of Series D
redeemable convertible preferred stock ("Series D") and warrants to purchase
approximately 246,000 shares of Series D-1 redeemable convertible preferred
stock ("Series D-1") for total consideration of $12,000,000. The warrants to
purchase shares of Series D-1 were valued at approximately $197,000. The Company
paid approximately $832,000 in legal and broker fees related to these issuances,
which has been reflected as a reduction in the proceeds from the sale of
Series D. In connection with the sale of Series D, the Company issued warrants
to purchase approximately 31,000 shares of Series D to a securities company as a
fee related to the transaction. The fair value of these warrants was
approximately $40,000.

    On February 26, 1999, pursuant to a stock purchase agreement with a new
investor, the Company issued approximately 513,000 shares of Series D for total

issued this new investor warrants to purchase approximately 386,000 shares of
Series D-1 in connection with the signing of a subscription agreement. The
warrants issued to this customer were valued at approximately $231,000 and are
accounted for as a discount to revenue over the term of the subscription
agreement. On February 22, 2000, the investor notified the Company that they
will terminate the subscription agreement, effective September 1, 2000.
Accordingly, the remaining sales discount will be amortized through

agreement with new and existing investors, the Company issued approximately

for approximately $16,999,000. The Company recorded a beneficial conversion
feature of approximately $8,115,000 as a dividend in the first quarter of 2000
to reflect the difference between the underlying convertible price per share of
common stock and the estimated fair market value of the common stock on the date
of issuance. The Company paid approximately $25,000 in issuance costs, which has
been reflected as a reduction in the proceeds from the sale of Series E.

Warrants

    In connection with the sales of the Series A, Series C, and Series D, the
Company issued warrants to investors to purchase an aggregate of approximately
150,000, 405,000, and 632,000 shares of Series B, Series C-1 and Series D-1,
respectively, at exercise prices of $6.65, $4.92, and $6.49 per share. In
connection with the sale of Series D, the Company also issued warrants to
purchase approximately 31,000 shares of Series D at $5.61 per share. The
warrants are immediately exercisable and may be exercised only in their
entirety.

    In May 2000, several existing investors exercised warrants to purchase
approximately 104,000, 357,000, and 197,000 shares of Series B, Series C-1, and
Series D-1, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately $2,534,000. Several
investors exercised their warrants on a cashless basis and accordingly, the
number of shares purchased was reduced, as defined in the respective stock
purchase agreements. Warrants to purchase approximately 31,000 and 386,000
shares of Series D and Series D-1, respectively, remain outstanding as of
June 30, 2000.

           NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

    The warrants to purchase shares of Series D will expire on the earlier of
(i) the fifth anniversary of the issuance date, (ii) on the date of the closing
of an initial public offering where the price per share is at least $7.40 per
share and the net proceeds to the Company are at least $15 million, or
(iii) 30 days after written notice from the Company informing the warrant holder
that the Company has completed a 12-month operating period during which gross
revenues equal or exceed $30 million. The warrants to purchase shares of
Series D-1 will expire on March 1, 2001.

Conversion

    Each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock is convertible into
common stock at the option of the holder and converts automatically at the
consummation date of a qualified initial public offering. As of December 31,
1999 and June 30, 2000, each share of Series A and Series B was convertible into
three shares of common stock, and each share of Series C, Series C-1, Series D,
Series D-1, and Series E was convertible into one and a half shares of common
stock. The conversion rates are subject to adjustments for events such as stock
splits, stock dividends, or issuances of stock.

Liquidation Preference

    In the event of liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the
holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, Series C-1, Series D, Series D-1, and
Series E are entitled to a liquidation preference over the holders of the
Company's common stock. The liquidation preference equals the original issuance
price plus any unpaid dividends. No dividends have been declared or paid through
June 30, 2000.

    Holders of Series D, Series D-1, and Series E shares have partial
liquidation preferences, which are preferential to other shares of redeemable
convertible preferred stock. This partial preference is limited to accrued
dividends of $.79, $1.86, and $4.75 per share, subject to stock dividends and
stock splits, for Series D, Series D-1, and Series E, respectively.

    If the holders of shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock would be
entitled to receive an amount per share greater than two times the original
issuance price for each share of redeemable convertible preferred stock, subject
to adjustment in the event of any stock dividend or stock split, then the
holders of the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock shall be
entitled to share only with the holders of the common stock on an
as-if-converted basis, and such holders of shares of redeemable convertible
preferred stock shall not be entitled to receive the liquidation preference.

Redemption

    At the option of the holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares
of each series of redeemable convertible preferred stock, the Company shall
redeem, commencing on August 7, 2002, and continuing on the immediately
succeeding two anniversaries thereof in three installments, taking into effect
the prior redemptions, the number of shares of that series held by the holders.
In the event that the holders of a majority of the aggregate number of shares of
the particular series do not elect to exercise their redemption rights, they may
elect to exercise such rights at a subsequent anniversary, subject to certain
defined limitations. The redemption price shall be the greater of the fair
market value of such shares or the liquidation preference. The Company records
periodic accretion under the effective

interest method on the redeemable convertible preferred stock to recognize the
excess of the redemption price over the carrying value. As of December 31, 1999
June 30, 2000, the redemption price is calculated based on the fair market value
of such shares ($15.00 and $13.50, respectively) as it is greater than the
liquidation preference.

6.  Stockholders' Equity (Deficit):

Stock Splits and Increase in Authorized Shares

    On February 10, 1997, the Company declared a two-for-one stock split
effected in the form of a stock dividend for each common share. On April 4,
2000, the board of directors voted to approve a three-for-two stock split which
will be effected in the form of a stock dividend for each common share just
prior to the closing of the offering. The Board also approved an increase in
authorized shares of common stock from 40,000,000 to 100,000,000 which will be
effected prior to the closing of the offering. All share information has been
adjusted retroactively in these consolidated financial statements for all
periods presented.

Common Stock

    Dividends may be declared and paid on common stock shares at the discretion
of the Company's Board of Directors and are subject to any preferential dividend
rights of any current outstanding Preferred Stock. No common stock dividends
have been declared or paid as of June 30, 2000.

    Subject to the voting rights of the holders of preferred stock shares, the
holder of each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters
voted on by the stockholders of the Company.

Stock Option Plan

    On July 26, 1996, the Company adopted a Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") in
order to provide an incentive to eligible employees, consultants, and officers
of the Company. The Plan provides for grants of incentive stock options,
nonqualified stock options, and stock awards to employees, directors,
consultants and advisors. Under the Plan, 6,750,000 shares of common stock were
reserved and available for distribution at December 31, 1999. On April 26, 2000
the number of shares reserved under the plan was increased to 8,250,000. For
incentive stock options, the exercise price may not be less than the determined
fair market value at the date of grant. For nonqualified stock options, the
exercise price shall be at least equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of
the shares at the date of grant. Stock options granted under the Plan vest over
a four to six-year period and expire ten years after the grant date.
Approximately 1,057,000 and 1,328,000 options were available for future grant as
of December 31, 1999 and June 30, 2000, respectively.

interpretations in accounting for its Plan. Accordingly, deferred compensation
cost of approximately $6,421,000 and $12,281,000 has been recorded for the year
ended December 31, 1999 and the six months ended June 30, 2000, respectively,
for its Plan based on the deemed intrinsic value of the stock option at the date
of the grant. The deferred compensation will be recognized over the vesting
period of the related options. No compensation expense related to options
granted during 1997 and 1998 has been included in the consolidated financial
statements because the exercise prices were equal to the fair market value at
the time the options were granted. For the year ended December 31, 1999 and the
six months ended June 30, 2000, the Company recognized compensation expense of
approximately $378,000 and $5,611,000, respectively.

    Had compensation expense for the Company's Plan been determined based on the
fair value at the grant dates for awards under the Plans consistent with the
method of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net loss would have been increased to the
pro forma amounts indicated below (in thousands).

2000 Stock Incentive Plan

    On April 4, 2000 the Company adopted a 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2000
Plan") to replace the 1996 Stock Option Plan, effective upon the completion of
the offering. 18,250,000 shares of common stock have been authorized for
issuance under the 2000 Plan which includes the shares subject to outstanding
options under the Plan. The 2000 Plan provides for grants of options to purchase
common stock and issuance of shares of common stock to employees, directors,
consultants and advisors.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

    On April 4, 2000 the Company adopted a Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"ESP Plan") to be effective upon the completion of the offering. 1,100,000
shares of common stock have been authorized for issuance under the ESP Plan.
Employees who work more than 20 hours a week for more than five calendar months

stock will be purchased semi-annually at a price per share equal to the lower of
85 percent of the fair market value on the participants date of entry into the

purchase date.

7.  Income Taxes:

    For the years ended December 31, 1997, 1998, and 1999, the tax provision was
comprised primarily of a deferred tax benefit which was offset by a valuation
allowance of the same amount. The tax provision differed from the expected tax
benefit, computed by applying the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 35% to the loss
before income taxes, principally due to the effect of increases in the valuation
allowance.

    Deferred tax assets are comprised of the following (in thousands):

</TABLE>

    Management believes that, based on a number of factors, the available
objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of
the deferred tax assets such that a full valuation allowance is required. Such
factors include the lack of a significant history of material profits, recent
increases in expense levels to support the Company's growth, the fact that the
market in which the Company competes is intensely competitive and characterized
by rapidly changing technology, the materiality of revenues from indirect
channel partners, the lack of carryback capacity to realize deferred tax assets,
and the uncertainty regarding market acceptance of new versions of the Company's
software.

    As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company had approximately
$12.4 million and $19.5 million, respectively, of federal net operating losses,
which will be carried forward to offset future taxable income, subject to
ownership change limitations. As of December 31, 1998 and 1999, the Company had
research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $379,000 and
$590,000, respectively. The net operating loss and research and development tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2011.

Operating Leases

    The Company leases various equipment and office space under operating lease
agreements expiring at various dates through 2004. In addition to base rent, the

six months ended June 30, 1999 and 2000, was approximately $345,000 and
$841,000, respectively.

License Agreements

    The Company has a value-added reseller license agreement with a third party
in which Vastera has agreed to pay a royalty of 2% of revenues generated from
its base application package in exchange for the right to sublicense the third
party's software through June 30, 2000. Effective July 2000 through December
2002, the Company has the right to sublicense the software royalty free.

    The Company has a license agreement with another third party in which the
Company can sublicense this third party's software in exchange for a royalty of
$350,000 in 2000 and 6% of its product revenue containing this software from
2001 through 2005.

Litigation

    On April 6, 1998, the Company settled an employment-related lawsuit with a
former employee by issuing 120,000 shares of common stock valued at $120,000.
The estimated settlement cost, including legal costs associated with the case,
was accrued as of December 31, 1997.

    The Company is periodically a party to disputes arising from normal business
activities. In the opinion of management, resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse effect upon the financial position or future operating
results of the Company.

9.  Employee Benefit Plan:

    The Company sponsors a 401(k) profit sharing plan to provide retirement and
incidental benefits for its employees (the "401(k) Plan"). As allowed under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) Plan provides
tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees. The Company may make
matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan. The Company contributed approximately
$148,000, $131,000, and $248,000 to the 401(k) Plan for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively, and $111,000 and $263,000 for
the six months ended June 30, 1999 and 2000, respectively.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Ford Motor Company:

    In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets, liabilities and
department equity and the related statements of net costs and expenses, and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Ford Motor Company Customs Compliance Operations at December 31, 1998 and
1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1999 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. These financial statements
are the responsibility of Ford Motor Company management; our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States which require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

2. Summary of Accounting Policies:

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in
the preparation of the financial statements:

Basis of Presentation

    The financial statements of the Customs Department have been derived from
the financial records of Ford and have been prepared to present the assets,
liabilities and department equity, net costs and expenses, and cash flows of the
Customs Department on a stand-alone basis. The financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States.

    Net costs and expenses of the Customs Department are absorbed by Ford.
Department equity represents the net investment of Ford in assets and
liabilities directly identifiable with the operations of the Customs Department.
The financial statements include allocations of certain Ford corporate expenses
including centralized legal, employee benefits, information technology services
and other administrative costs. The expense allocations were determined on bases
that Ford and the Customs Department considered to be a reasonable reflection of
the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by the Customs
Department. These

<PAGE>
                FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

costs are allocated on a monthly basis based, as appropriate, on the number of
personnel assigned or hours dedicated to the activities. However, the financial
information included herein may not reflect the financial position, operating
results and cash flows of the Customs Department in the future or what they
would have been operating as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods
presented.

Use of Estimates

    The presentation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and
expenses for the periods presented. Actual results in the future could differ
from those estimates and assumptions.

Revenue

    Revenues represent amounts invoiced to one third party and one related
party.

Accounts Receivable

    Accounts receivable represent amounts, excluding duty costs, due from one
third party.

Capitalized Software Costs

    Capitalized software costs are stated at cost net of accumulated
amortization. The cost consists of capitalized development costs for five
systems utilized by the Customs Department. The four systems facilitate customs
processes including inventory tracking, account reconciliation, information
storage and duty calculations. The costs were calculated based on actual billing
from external consultants as well as cost of Ford employees directly involved in
the software development and reflect the adoption of AICPA Statement of
Position 98-1 "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or
Obtained for Internal Use" as of January 1, 1999. Costs of software development
incurred prior to January 1, 1999 are included in operating expenses in the
period incurred.

    Amortization of capitalized software costs is calculated using the
straight-line method over an estimated useful life of five years and commences
the month in which the system is placed into service.

Current Liabilities

    Accounts payable consist primarily of broker costs payable as of the date of
the report. Accrued salaries include accrued employee bonuses and accrued
service fees for accounting and audit services from third parties. Employee
bonuses are accrued based on corporate salary rates provided by Ford.

Foreign Currency Translation

    Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations generally are translated to
U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates using the U.S. dollar as the
functional currency. Income

                FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMS COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

statement elements of all non-U.S. operations are translated to U.S. dollars at
average-period exchange rates and are recognized as part of revenues, costs and
expenses. There are no material gains or losses resulting from translation of
foreign currency amounts.

    Capitalized software costs are as follows (in thousands):

4. Department Equity:

    Since the Customs Department is not a separate entity, formal loans and
funding arrangements are not established with Ford. Net costs and expenses of
the Customs Department are funded by Ford without any charges allocated to the
departments for interest expense. Therefore, the net operating costs and
expenses above do not include interest costs.

    Other customs department expenses are as follows:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

6. Related Party Transactions:

    For all periods presented, substantially all of the transactions of the
Customs Department are with Ford and its subsidiaries and affiliates.

7. Employee Retirement Plans:

    Ford has a General Retirement Plan and other post retirement benefits that
cover all employees in the United States. Employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries are
covered under separate plans that generally provide similar types of benefits.
The assets and obligations of the benefit plans are maintained by Ford and are
not allocated to the various departments. These statements include an allocation
of expenses related to retirement benefits for the Customs Department employees.
The allocation is based on a pro-rata share of total retirement benefit expense.

8. Subsequent Events:

    On July 14, 2000, Ford entered into a definitive agreement with Vastera
Solution Services Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vastera, Inc.
("Vastera Solutions"), which will result in Vastera Solutions acquiring the
Customs Department. This transaction is expected to be completed when regulatory
approval is received.

           FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION REGARDING THE FORD ACQUISITION


    In connection with our acquisition of Ford's global customs unit, we
contracted with Ford to provide them with global trade management services. We
will initially provide our suite of product and service offerings to Ford in the
United States. If we have successfully implemented our services in the United
States, we will have the opportunity under our agreement with Ford to provide
our services to Ford divisions and subsidiaries in other geographic regions
around the world. The contractual terms relating to the foreign operations have
not been finalized and are subject to negotiation based upon the actual costs
incurred by Ford in 2000. Our agreement with Ford has a minimum term of four
years. After August 1, 2003, either party may terminate for any reason after
providing the non-terminating party one year's advance notice. Commencing on
August 1, 2004 and continuing thereafter, either party may terminate the
agreement for any reason upon providing six months' advance written notice.



    We will be compensated for our services based on the number of transactions
executed, subject to certain guaranteed minimum transaction revenues through
2004 totaling approximately $47.0 million. The guaranteed minimum revenues are
$4.5 million for 2000, $11.6 million for 2001, 2002 and 2003 and $6.8 million
for 2004. The agreement also calls for gainsharing revenues equal to 10% of
annual cost savings up to a certain threshold and 15% above that threshold. Cost
savings will be calculated by comparing the historical costs incurred by Ford
with the future costs incurred under our agreement with Ford. These costs
include only duty, taxes, other related government payments and customs broker
costs paid by Ford.


    This customer relationship will have a significant impact on our total
revenue and is expected to account for greater than 10% of revenues for the
foreseeable future, beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2000. In
addition, because approximately one-third of the revenues derived by Ford's
global customs unit historically have been attributable to its foreign
operations, we expect to experience an increasingly higher percentage of our
revenues from foreign operations in the future if we enter into one or more
agreements with Ford to provide services to Ford operations in other countries
and regions. Revenues in excess of the guaranteed minimums are dependent upon
our ability to successfully manage Ford's global trade operations and,
therefore, we are unable to accurately forecast revenues in excess of the
guaranteed minimums. As a result of our agreement with Ford, we expect
subscription/transaction revenues to increase significantly in total and as a
percentage of total revenues.


    The costs represented in the historical financial statements of Ford Motor
Company Customs Compliance Department are those that Ford incurred operating
this department. We will assume these costs with the exception of the broker
costs. These costs (excluding broker costs) were approximately $18.5 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 and $8.8 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2000. Of the $18.5 million, $11.5 million represented the costs of the
United States custom operations. We expect our costs to increase above the
historical cost levels incurred by Ford as we invest heavily in our support
infrastructure to manage this agreement. We expect these increased costs to be
eventually offset by future revenues with Ford and its affiliates, future
revenues with third parties and future operating efficiencies. Overall, we
expect our cost of subscription/transaction revenues to increase in total and as
a percentage of subscription/transaction revenues.

             PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Introduction to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

    On July 14, 2000, we entered into a definitive agreement with Ford Motor
Company to acquire Ford's global customs unit, officially called the Ford Motor
Company Customs Compliance Department, in exchange for 8,000,000 shares of the
Company's common stock valued at $79.2 million based on a per share price of
$9.90. Under the terms of our agreement, Ford will merge its global customs
unit, consisting of personnel and technology currently used by Ford to manage
its worldwide trade, into our managed services operations.

    Under the 10-year agreement with Ford, we will manage Ford's global trade
operations for a minimum term of four years and a maximum term of 10 years. As
consideration for our software products and service offerings, Ford has agreed
to pay us based on certain minimum transaction thresholds as well as a
gain-sharing fee equal to a specified percentage of the cost savings experienced
by Ford under our agreement. We will initially provide our product and service
offerings to Ford in the United States. Under our agreement, after successful
implementation of our services in the United States, we will commence providing
our services to Ford divisions and subsidiaries in other geographic regions
around the world in a phased approach.

    The historical financial statements of Ford Motor Company Customs Compliance
Department do not reflect revenues for the customs services provided to Ford and
its affiliates; instead, Ford absorbed the operations of this department and
accounted for the costs of its customs services as costs and expenses due to its
operations. Since these historical financial statements did not reflect revenues
or costs of revenues, we were unable to reflect pro forma revenues and pro forma
costs of revenues in the accompanying pro forma statements of operations in
accordance with the pro forma accounting disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. While we reflect no revenues from Ford in our pro forma
financial statements, we expect under our agreement with Ford to earn and record
revenues based upon the services we provide to Ford and its affiliates
subsequent to the acquisition. The revenues from this contract will consist of
transaction fees. A transaction fee is a negotiated amount based upon the
estimated costs of managing the international transactions. The costs
represented in the historical financial statements of Ford Motor Company Customs
Compliance Department are those that Ford incurred operating this department. We
will assume these costs with the exception of the broker costs. Please see
"Forward-Looking Statements Regarding the Ford Acquisition" on page F-35 for
more information. We believe that this acquisition will also result in further
revenue opportunities in addition to the revenues we receive through our
agreement with Ford. These opportunities include the ability to promote our
products and services to Ford's vendors, other companies in the automotive
industry and other third parties.

    The following pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
2000 and the pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the
six months ended June 30, 2000 and the year ended December 31, 1999 illustrate
the effect of our acquisition of Ford's global customs unit. The pro forma
condensed consolidated balance sheet assumes that the acquisition had been
completed as of June 30, 2000 and the pro forma condensed consolidated
statements of operations assume that the acquisition was completed at the
beginning of the period presented, January 1, 1999. Certain reclassifications
have been made to Ford's financial statements to conform to our customary
presentation.

    The pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are presented for
informational purposes only and are not indicative of either future results of
operations or

                                      F-36
<PAGE>
results that might have been achieved if our acquisition of Ford's global
customs unit had been consummated as of the indicated dates. The pro forma
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
our historical financial statements and those of Ford's global customs unit,
together with the related notes thereto, which are included in this registration
statement.

  ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

    We will account for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting.
Under the purchase method of accounting, a new basis will be established for the
personnel and technology acquired, and any excess of the consideration over the
fair value of the acquired assets will be accounted for as goodwill. The results
of operations of Ford's global customs unit will be included in our results of
operations beginning upon the consummation of the acquisition and as each
geographic region is phased in. The Company expects to phase in Canada and
Mexico during the first quarter of 2001 and Europe in the second half of 2001.

    The pro forma adjustments are based upon currently available information and
assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on the historical financial
statements of the Ford Motor Company Customs Compliance Department. The
adjustments included in the pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements represent the preliminary determination of these adjustments based
upon available information. We cannot assure you that the actual adjustments
will not differ significantly from the pro forma adjustments reflected in the
pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements.

    The purchase price, including transaction costs, has been allocated on a
preliminary basis as follows:

    As of the date of the acquisition, we began amortizing the value assigned to
the licensed technology, the Ford contract and goodwill over the related
estimated useful lives. The value assigned to the assembled workforce will be
allocated to each country in which we provide services to Ford, based upon the
number of employees in each country, and the related amortization will be
recorded over three years from the date we assume Ford's customs operations in
each country.

      8,000,000 shares of Vastera common stock valued based on a price per share
      of $9.90 which was the fair market value of Vastera's common stock on
      June 30, 2000 based on a 10% discount from our anticipated per share
      offering price.

    These statements do not represent what our results of operations would have
been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period presented,
January 1, 1999, due to our inability to give retroactive treatment to future
revenues and cost of revenues to be earned or incurred under our agreement with
Ford. See "Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements--Introduction

    These statements do not represent what our results of operations would have
been had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period presented,
January 1, 1999, due to our inability to give retroactive treatment to future
revenues and cost of revenues to be earned or incurred under our agreement with
Ford. See "Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements--Introduction

(D) Reflects the operating results of Vastera for the six months ended June 30,
    2000 and the year ended December 31, 1999. The net loss per share amounts
    assume the conversion of all outstanding convertible preferred stock into
    common stock upon the consumation of the offering.

(E) Reflects the operating results of Ford Motor Company Customs Compliance
    Department for the six months ended June 30, 2000 and the year ended
    December 31, 1999, including various reclassifications that have been made
    to conform Vastera's financial statement presentation.

(F) Pro forma adjustments to record the acquisition for the six months ended
    June 30, 2000 and the year ended December 31, 1999 reflect:

    - Elimination of approximately $14.0 million and approximately
      $25.4 million, respectively, of broker costs as these costs will continue
      to be paid by Ford. Broker costs represent the costs associated with the
      daily customs release of goods and the preparation of the related customs
      declarations. Ford had previously entered and will continue to enter into
      contracts with these brokers. Accordingly, Ford will continue to be
      obligated to pay these parties under these contracts.

    - Increases of approximately $10.2 million and approximately $20.5 million,
      respectively, in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets
      acquired.

    - The weighted average common shares outstanding used in calculating basic
      and diluted loss per common share was calculated assuming the conversion
      of all outstanding convertible preferred stock into common stock. The
      weighted average common shares outstanding used in calculating basic and
      diluted pro forma loss per common share was calculated assuming the
      conversion of all outstanding convertible preferred stock into common
      stock upon the consumation of the offering and that the 8,000,000 shares
      of Vastera common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of Ford
      Motor Company Customs Compliance Department were outstanding from the
      beginning of the periods presented.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers

    Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") provides,
in effect, that any person made a party to any action by reason of the fact that
he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of Vastera may and, in
certain cases, must be indemnified by Vastera against, in the case of a
non-derivative action, judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and
reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by him as a result of
such action, and in the case of a derivative action, against expenses (including
attorneys' fees), if in either type of action he acted in good faith and in a
manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
Vastera. This indemnification does not apply, in a derivative action, to matters
as to which it is adjudged that the director, officer, employee or agent is
liable to Vastera, unless upon court order it is determined that, despite such
adjudication of liability, but in view of all the circumstances of the case, he
is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for expenses, and, in a
non-derivative action, to any criminal proceeding in which such person had
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.

    Article VI of Vastera's certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides
that no director of Vastera shall be liable to Vastera or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director to the fullest
extent permitted by the DGCL.

    Article VII of Vastera's certificate of incorporation, as amended, also
provides that Vastera shall indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by
Delaware law any and all of its directors and officers, or former directors and
officers, or any person who may have served at Vastera's request as a director
or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

    Reference is made to Section 8 of the underwriting agreement to be filed as
Exhibit 1.1 hereto, pursuant to which the Underwriters have agreed to indemnify
officers and directors of Vastera against certain liabilities under the
Securities Act.

    Vastera has entered into Indemnification Agreements with each director of
Vastera, a form of which is filed as Exhibit 10.5 to this Registration
Statement. Pursuant to such agreements, Vastera will be obligated, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, to indemnify such

                                      II-1
<PAGE>
directors against all expenses, judgments, fines and penalties incurred in
connection with the defense or settlement of any actions brought against them by
reason of the fact that they were directors of Vastera or assumed certain
responsibilities at the direction of Vastera. Vastera also intends to purchase
directors and officers liability insurance in order to limit its exposure to
liability for indemnification of directors and officers.

(b) Financial Statement Schedules

    Schedule I--Report of Independent Public Accountants

    Schedule II--Valuation and Qualifying Accounts

Item 17. Undertakings.

    The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes

    (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a
post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

         (i) To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the
             Securities Act of 1933;

        (ii) To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the
             effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent
             post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the
             aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set
             forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
             any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the
             total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that
             which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of
             the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form
             of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) if,
             in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price

                                      II-5
<PAGE>
             represent no more than 20 percent change in the maximum aggregate
             offering price set forth in the "Calculation of Registration Fee"
             table in the effective registration statement; and

        (iii) To include any material information with respect to the plan of
              distribution not previously disclosed in the registration
              statement or any material change to such information in the
              registration statement.

    (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities
Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new
registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
fide offering thereof.

    (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any
of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the
offering.

    Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Act may be
permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant
pursuant to provisions described in Item 14 above, or otherwise, the registrant
has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred
or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the
successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being
registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter
has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.

    The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes (1) to provide to the
underwriter at the closing specified in the standby underwriting agreement,
certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by
the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser; (2) that for
purposes of determining any liability under the Act, the information omitted
from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in
reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the
registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Act shall be
deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared
effective; and (3) that for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

    The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to supplement the prospectus,
after the expiration of the subscription period, to set forth the results of the
subscription offer, the transactions by the underwriters during the subscription
period, the amount of unsubscribed securities to be purchased by the
underwriters, and the terms of any subsequent reoffering thereof. If any public
offering by the underwriters is to be made on terms differing from those set
forth on the cover page of the prospectus, a post-effective amendment will be
filed to set forth the terms of such offering.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Vastera, Inc.:

    We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States, the financial statements of Vastera, Inc. included in this
registration statement and have issued our report thereon dated April 5, 2000.
Our audit was made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The schedule listed in the index is the
responsibility of the Company's management and is presented for purposes of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a part
of the basic financial statements. The information as of December 31, 1997, 1998
and 1999, and for the three years in the period ended December 31, 1999 included
in the schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states, in
all material respects, the financial data required to be set forth therein in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
