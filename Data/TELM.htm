                               PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

        This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this
prospectus.  This summary is not complete and may not contain all of the
information that you should consider before investing in the securities.

Tellium, Inc.

  We design, develop and market high-speed, high-capacity, intelligent optical
switches that enable telecommunications service providers to quickly and cost-
effectively deliver new high-speed services. Intelligent optical switches are
products that are installed in the core, or center, of telecommunications
networks to manage the flow of optical signals, which are beams of light
transmitted over fiber optic cables. Our target customer base includes emerging
and established service providers, which include long-distance carriers and
wholesale service providers, Internet service providers and cable operators. We
believe that the network equipment that service providers are currently using
does not offer sufficient flexibility to improve data service offerings and does
not allow service providers to upgrade their networks in a timely and cost-
effective manner.

  Our products are designed to efficiently meet the demand for increased network
capacity. They are based on highly reliable hardware combined with feature-rich
software and integrated network planning and network management tools, each of
which can be easily expanded, enabling service providers to grow and manage
their networks quickly and efficiently. This capability allows our customers to
keep pace with the dynamic requirements of data services. Since the second
quarter of 1999, we have focused solely on the development of optical switches.
In the first quarter of 1999, we shipped our first generation Aurora 32 optical
switch and, in the third quarter of 2000, we shipped our second generation
Aurora Optical Switch. In the second quarter of 2001, we shipped our Aurora 128,
a cost-efficient, compact version of our Aurora Optical Switch.  We currently
market and sell all of these products.

  We currently have minimum commitment or exclusivity contracts with the
following three customers: Cable & Wireless Global Networks Limited, Dynegy
Connect, L.P., a subsidiary of Dynegy, Inc., and Qwest Communications
Corporation, although we have not yet recognized any revenue from Cable &
Wireless.

  We were founded in April 1997 by a group of individuals from Bell
Communications Research, Inc., or Bellcore. Prior to 1999, we were principally
engaged in research and development. We have limited meaningful historical
financial data upon which to base projected revenues and have incurred
significant losses to date. We have derived much of our revenue from our
contract with Extant, Inc., which was transferred to Dynegy Connect in September
2000. This contract accounted for approximately 78% and 70% of our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001,
respectively. We have also derived revenue from our contract with Qwest, which
accounted for approximately 18% and 30% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
for the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. As of March 31, 2001,
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $206.0

<PAGE>

million. We expect to have large fixed expenses and to incur increasing
marketing, sales, research, manufacturing and administrative expenses, and we
expect to incur net losses in the future.

  Our optical switches and software provide the following key benefits to
service providers:

  . Improved network design. Our optical switches are designed to enable service
    providers to reduce their costs by making it simpler to plan, operate,
    administer and maintain their networks.

  . Simplified delivery of new services.   Our optical switches help service
    providers create flexible optical networks, enabling reliable, fast, cost-
    effective delivery of new and existing optical data services. We accomplish
    this by simplifying the network over which the services are delivered and
    automating the service delivery functions.

  . Fast provisioning of new services.   Our optical switches allow service
    providers to provision, or set up, services across their networks in a
    matter of minutes, replacing a process which can often take up to several
    months.

  . Easy network expansion.   Our optical switches help service providers expand
    their networks automatically, eliminating the need for manual changes to the
    network. This enables our customers to provide new revenue-generating
    services that meet their customers' needs.

  . Cost-effectiveness. Our optical switches are modular, allowing our customers
    to retain their investments as they expand capacity, automate operations and
    eliminate costly equipment while retaining the features that they expect.

  . Compatibility with existing networks.   Our optical switches can be deployed
    quickly in networks today because they operate within existing networks.

  . Flexible products.   Our optical switches are easy to upgrade because all of
    our products share common hardware and software.

                                  RISK FACTORS

  Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should
carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained
in this prospectus, including our financial statements and the related notes,
before you purchase any shares of our common stock.


Risks Related to Our Business and Financial Results

We have incurred significant losses to date and expect to continue to incur
losses in the future, which may cause our stock price to decline.

  We have not recognized meaningful revenue and have incurred significant losses
to date. We expect to continue to incur losses in the future. We had net losses
of approximately $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and
approximately $49.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2001. As of
December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001, we had an accumulated deficit of
approximately $156.1 million and $206.0 million, respectively. We have large
fixed expenses and expect to continue to incur significant manufacturing,
research and development, sales and marketing, administrative and other expenses
in connection with the ongoing development and expansion of our business. We
expect these operating expenses to increase significantly as we increase our
spending in order to develop and grow our business. In order to become
profitable, we will need to generate and sustain higher revenue. If we do not
generate sufficient revenues to achieve or sustain profitability, our stock
price will likely decline.


Our limited operating history makes forecasting our future revenues and
operating results difficult, which may impair our ability to manage our business
and your ability to assess our prospects.

  We began our business operations in May 1997 and shipped our first optical
switch in January 1999. We have limited meaningful historical financial and
operational data upon which we can base projected revenues and planned operating
expenses and upon which you may evaluate us and our prospects. As a young
company in the new and rapidly evolving optical switching industry, we face
risks relating to our ability to implement our business plan, including our
ability to continue to develop and upgrade our technology and our ability to
maintain and develop customer and supplier relationships. You should consider
our business and prospects in light of the heightened risks and unexpected
expenses and problems we may face as a company in an early stage of development
in our industry.


We expect that substantially all of our revenues will be generated from a
limited number of customers, including Cable & Wireless, Dynegy Connect and
Qwest. The termination or deterioration of our relationship with these customers
will have a significant negative impact on our revenue and cause us to continue
to incur substantial operating losses.

  For the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended March 31,
2001, we

                                       5
<PAGE>

have derived significant revenue from sales under our contract with Extant,
which was transferred to Dynegy Connect in September 2000. We anticipate that
substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future will be derived
from Cable & Wireless, Dynegy Connect and Qwest.

  Dynegy is proceeding with Extant's planned network build-out. Dynegy may,
however, change its plans at any time and determine not to proceed with the
build-out on a timely basis or at all. If Dynegy Connect were to stop or delay
purchasing products or services from us, or reduce the amount of products or
services that it obtains from us, our revenues would be reduced.

  In addition, although Dynegy Connect has agreed to purchase its full
requirements for optical switches from us until November 1, 2003, Dynegy Connect
is not contractually obligated to purchase future products or services from us
and may discontinue doing so at any time. Dynegy Connect is permitted to
terminate the agreement for, among other things, a breach of our material
obligations under the contract.

  Under our agreement with Cable & Wireless, Cable & Wireless has made a
commitment to purchase a minimum of $350 million of our optical switches by
August 7, 2005. Our agreement with Cable & Wireless gives Cable & Wireless the
right to reduce its minimum purchase commitment from $350 million to $200
million if we do not maintain a technological edge so that there exists in the
marketplace superior technology that we have not matched. This agreement also
permits Cable & Wireless to terminate the agreement upon breach of a variety of
our obligations under the contract.

  Under our agreement with Qwest, Qwest has made a commitment to purchase a
minimum of $300 million of our optical switches over the first three years of
the contract and, subject to extensions under a limited circumstance, an
additional $100 million over the following two years of the contract. This
agreement allows Qwest, through binding arbitration, to terminate the agreement
upon breach of a variety of our obligations under the contract.

  If any of these customers elects to terminate its contract with us or if a
customer fails to purchase our products for any reason, we would lose
significant revenue and incur substantial operating losses, which would
seriously harm our ability to build a successful business.


If we do not attract new customers, our revenue may not increase.

  We are currently very dependent on three customers. We must expand our
customer base in order to succeed. If we are not able to attract new customers
who are willing to make significant commitments to purchase our products and
services for any reason, including if there is a downturn in their businesses,
our business will not grow and our revenue will not increase. Our customer base
and revenue will not grow if:

  . customers are unwilling or slow to utilize our products;

  . we experience delays or difficulties in completing the development and
    introduction of our

                                       6
<PAGE>

    planned products or product enhancements;

  . our competitors introduce new products that are superior to our products;

  . our products do not perform as expected; or

  . we do not meet our customers' delivery requirements.


  In the past, we issued warrants to some customers. We may not be able to
attract new customers and expand our sales with our existing customers if we do
not provide warrants or other incentives.

If our line of optical switches or their future enhancements are not
successfully developed, they will not be accepted by our customers and our
target market, and our future revenue will not grow.

  We began to focus on the marketing and the selling of optical switches in the
second quarter of 1999. No service provider has fully deployed our optical
switches in a large, complex network. Our future revenue growth depends on the
commercial success and adoption of our optical switches.

  We are developing new products and enhancements to existing products. We may
not be able to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner,
or at all. For example, our Aurora Full-Spectrum switch depends on advancements
in optical components, including micro-electromechanical systems, which have not
yet been proven for telecommunications products. Any failure to develop new
products or product enhancements will substantially decrease market acceptance
and sales of our present and future products. Any failure to develop new
products or product enhancements could also delay purchases by our customers
under their contracts, or, in some cases, could cause us to be in breach under
our contracts with our customers. Even if we are able to develop and
commercially introduce new products and enhancements, these new products or
enhancements may not achieve widespread market acceptance and may not be
satisfactory to our customers. Any failure of our future products to achieve
market acceptance or be satisfactory to our customers could slow or eliminate
our revenue growth.


Due to the long and variable sales cycles for our products, our revenues and
operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As a result,
our quarterly results may be below the expectations of market analysts and
investors, causing the price of our common stock to decline.

  Our sales cycle is lengthy because a customer's decision to purchase our
products involves a significant commitment of its resources and a lengthy
evaluation, testing and product qualification process. We may incur substantial
expenses and devote senior management attention to potential relationships that
may never materialize, in which event our investments

                                       7
<PAGE>

will largely be lost and we may miss other opportunities. In addition, after we
enter into a contract with a customer, the timing of purchases and deployment of
our products may vary widely and will depend on a number of factors, many of
which are beyond our control, including:

  . specific network deployment plans of the customer;

  . installation skills of the customer;

  . size of the network deployment;

  . complexity of the customer's network;

  . degree of hardware and software changes required; and

  . new product availability.

  For example, customers with significant or complex networks usually expand
their networks in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, we may
receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and
unpredictable basis. The long sales cycles, as well as the placement of large
orders with short lead times on an irregular and unpredictable basis, may cause
our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from
quarter to quarter. As a result, it is likely that in some future quarters our
operating results may be below the expectations of market analysts and
investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.


We expect the average selling prices of our products to decline, which may
reduce revenues and gross margins.

  Our industry has experienced a rapid erosion of average product selling
prices. Consistent with this general trend, we anticipate that the average
selling prices of our products will decline in response to a number of factors,
including:

  . competitive pressures;

  . increased sales discounts; and

  . new product introductions by our competitors.

  If we are unable to achieve sufficient cost reductions and increases in sales
volumes, this decline in average selling prices of our products will reduce our
revenues and gross margins.


We will be required to record significant non-cash charges as a result of
warrants, options and other equity issuances. These non-cash charges will
adversely affect our future operating

                                       8
<PAGE>

results and investors may consider this impact material, in which case the price
of our common stock could decline.

  The warrant held by affiliates of Dynegy Connect allows them to purchase
5,226,000 shares of our common stock at $3.05 per share. When we granted the
warrant, the majority of shares subject to the warrant were scheduled to become
exercisable as Dynegy Connect met specified milestones during the term of our
contract. We recorded non-cash charges of approximately $1.7 million,
approximately $2.4 million and approximately $4.3 million related to the warrant
for the years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000 and for the three
months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. A non-cash charge of approximately
$1.1 million was recorded to sales and marketing expense to reflect the fair
market value of the shares vested subject to the warrant at the grant date. As
of November 2, 2000, we amended the warrant agreement to immediately vest all of
the remaining shares subject to the warrant. The revised agreement provides that
the warrant becomes exercisable based on the schedule of milestones previously
contained in the warrant. If the milestones are not reached by March 31, 2005,
the remaining unexercised shares subject to the warrant shall then become
exercisable. In connection with the execution of this amendment, we will incur a
non-cash charge of approximately $90.6 million. This charge will be recorded as
a reduction of revenue as we realize revenue from this contract. Charges of
approximately $584,000, approximately $2.4 million and approximately $4.3
million have been recorded as an offset to revenue for the years ended December
31, 1999 and December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001,
respectively, to reflect the fair value of the shares subject to the warrant
earned by Dynegy Global Communications based upon purchases through that date.

  As part of our agreement with Qwest, we issued three warrants to a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Qwest to purchase 2,375,000 shares of our common stock
exercisable at $14.00 per share. The 2,375,000 shares subject to the warrants
were vested when we issued the warrants. One of the warrants is exercisable as
to 1,000,000 shares. Another warrant becomes exercisable as to 1,000,000 shares
at the earlier of Qwest meeting specified milestones during the term of our
procurement contract or on September 18, 2005, which is five years from the date
of the warrant. The third warrant becomes exercisable as to the remaining
375,000 shares at the earlier of Qwest meeting a milestone during the term of
our procurement contract or on April 10, 2007, which is six years from the date
of the warrant. The fair market value of the issued warrants, approximately
$38.0 million, will be recorded as a reduction of revenue related to the Qwest
procurement contract. We recorded non-cash charges of approximately $328,000 and
$531,000 as an offset to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for
the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.

  We will incur significant additional non-cash charges as a result of our
acquisition of Astarte and our acquisition of an intellectual property license
from AT&T. The goodwill and intangible assets associated with the Astarte
acquisition were approximately $113.3 million. The intangible asset associated
with the acquisition of the AT&T license is approximately $45.0 million. The
goodwill and intangible assets are being amortized over five years.

  In addition, we have recorded deferred compensation expense and have begun to
amortize non-cash charges to earnings as a result of options and other equity
awards granted to employees

                                       9
<PAGE>

and non-employee directors at prices deemed to be below fair market value on the
dates of grant. Our future operating results will reflect the continued
amortization of those charges over the vesting period of these options and
awards. At March 31, 2001, we had recorded deferred compensation expense of
approximately $191.3 million, which will be amortized to compensation expense
between 2001 and 2005.

  We have also issued certain performance-based options to employees and
consultants. If the performance criteria are met, we will record significant
non-cash charges that will negatively impact our operating results. At this
time, it is not possible to determine the amount of these charges as they will
be based in part on the fair market value of our common stock at the time the
performance criteria are met.

  All of the non-cash charges referred to above will negatively impact future
operating results. It is possible that some investors might consider the impact
on operating results to be material, which could result in a decline in the
price of our common stock.


Risks Related to Our Products

Our products may have errors or defects that we find only after full deployment,
or problems may arise from the use of our products in conjunction with other
vendors' products, which could, among other things, make us lose customers and
revenues.

  Our products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large and complex
networks. Our products can only be fully tested when completely deployed in
these networks with high amounts of traffic. To date, no service provider has
fully deployed our optical switches in a large, complex network. Networking
products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when first
introduced or as new versions are released. Our customers may discover errors or
defects in our software or hardware, or our products may not operate as expected
after they have been fully deployed. In addition, service providers typically
use our products in conjunction with products from other vendors. As a result,
if problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem.

  If we are unable to fix any defects or errors or other problems arise, we
could:

  . lose revenues;

  . lose existing customers;

  . fail to attract new customers and achieve market acceptance;

  . divert development resources;

  . increase service and repair, warranty and insurance costs; and

  . be subjected to legal actions for damages by our customers.

                                       10
<PAGE>

If our products do not operate within our customers' networks, installations
will be delayed or cancelled, reducing our revenues, or we may have to modify
some of our product designs. Product modifications could increase our expenses
and reduce the margins on our products.

  Our customers require that our products be designed to operate within their
existing networks, each of which may have different specifications. Our
customers' networks contain multiple generations of products that have been
added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. If our products do not
operate within our customers' networks, installations could be delayed and
orders for our products could be cancelled, causing our revenues to decline. The
requirement that we modify product designs in order to achieve a sale may result
in a longer sales cycle, increased research and development expense and reduced
margins on our products.


If our products do not meet industry standards that may emerge, or if some
industry standards are not ultimately adopted, we will not gain market
acceptance and our revenues will not grow.

  Our success depends, in part, on both the adoption of industry standards for
new technologies in our market and our products' compliance with industry
standards. To date, no industry standards have been adopted related to some
functions of our products. The absence of industry standards may prevent market
acceptance of our products if potential customers delay purchases of new
equipment until standards are adopted. In addition, in developing our products,
we have made, and will continue to make, assumptions about the industry
standards that may be adopted by our competitors and existing and potential
customers. If the standards adopted are different from those which we have
chosen to support, customers may not choose our products, and our sales and
related revenues will be significantly reduced.


If we do not establish and increase our market share in the intensively
competitive optical networking market, we will experience, among other things,
reduced revenues and gross margins.

  If we do not compete successfully in the intensely competitive market for
public telecommunications network equipment, we may lose any advantage that we
might have by being the first to market with an optical switch prior to
achieving significant market penetration. In addition to losing any competitive
advantage, we may also:

  . not be able to obtain or retain customers;

  . experience price reductions for our products;

  . experience order cancellations;

  . experience increased expenses; and

                                       11
<PAGE>

  . experience reduced gross margins.

  Many of our competitors, in comparison to us, have:

  . longer operating histories;

  . greater name recognition;

  . larger customer bases; and

  . significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, manufacturing
    and other resources.

  These competitors may be able to reduce our market share by adopting more
aggressive pricing policies than we can or by developing products that gain
wider market acceptance than our products.


Risks Related to the Expansion of Our Business

If the optical switching market does not develop as we expect, our operating
results will be negatively affected and our stock price could decline.

  The market for optical switching is extremely new and rapidly evolving.
Optical switching may not be widely adopted as a method by which service
providers address their data capacity requirements. In addition, most service
providers have made substantial investments in their current network and are
typically reluctant to adopt new and unproven technologies. They may elect to
remain with their current network design or to adopt a new design, like ours, in
limited stages or over extended periods of time. A decision by a customer to
purchase our product involves a significant capital investment. We will need to
convince service providers of the benefits of our products for future network
upgrades, and if we are unable to do so, a viable market for our products may
not develop or be sustainable. If the market for optical switching does not
develop, or develops more slowly than we expect, our operating results will be
below our expectations and the price of our stock could decline.


If we are not successful in rapidly developing new and enhanced products that
respond to customer requirements and technological changes, customers will not
buy our products and we could lose revenue.

  The market for optical switching is characterized by rapidly changing
technologies, frequent new product introductions and evolving customer and
industry standards. We may be unable to anticipate or respond quickly or
effectively to rapid technological changes. Also, we may experience design,
manufacturing, marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our
development and introduction of new products and enhancements. In addition, if
our competitors introduce products based on new or alternative technologies, our
existing and future

                                       12
<PAGE>

products could become obsolete and our sales could decrease.

  Our customers require some product features and capabilities that our current
products do not have. If we fail to develop or enhance our products or to offer
services that satisfy evolving customer demands, we will not be able to satisfy
our existing customers' requirements or increase demand for our products. If
this happens, we will lose customers and breach our existing contracts with our
customers, our operating results will be negatively impacted and the price of
our stock could decline.


If we do not expand our sales, marketing and distribution channels, we may be
unable to increase market awareness and sales of our products, which may prevent
us from increasing our sales and achieving and maintaining profitability.

  Our products require a sophisticated sales and marketing effort targeted
towards a limited number of key individuals within our current and prospective
customers' organizations. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to
develop and manage these relationships. We continue to build our direct sales
and marketing force and plan to hire additional sales and marketing personnel
and consulting engineers. Competition for these individuals is intense because
there is a limited number of people available with the necessary technical
skills and understanding of the optical switching market. In addition, we
believe that our success will depend on our ability to establish successful
relationships with various distribution partners. If we are unable to expand our
sales, marketing and distribution operations, we may not be able to effectively
market and sell our products, which may prevent us from increasing our sales and
achieving and maintaining profitability.


If we do not expand our customer service and support organization, we may be
unable to increase our sales.

  We currently have a small customer service and support organization and will
need to increase our staff to support new and existing customers. Our products
are complex and our customers need highly-trained customer service and support
personnel to be available at all hours. We are likely to have difficulty hiring
customer service and support personnel because of the limited number of people
available with the necessary technical skills. If we are unable to expand our
customer service and support organization and rapidly train these personnel, we
may not be able to increase our sales, which could cause the price of our stock
to decline.


Our failure to manage our growth, improve existing processes and implement new
systems could result in lost sales or disruptions to our business.

  We have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in May 1997. Our
growth has placed, and we anticipate that our growth will continue to place, a
significant strain on our management systems and resources. Our ability to
successfully sell our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly
evolving market requires an effective planning and management

                                       13
<PAGE>

process. From March 31, 2000 to March 31, 2001, the number of our employees
increased from 156 to 493. We expect that we will need to continue to refine and
expand our financial, managerial and manufacturing controls and reporting
systems. If we are unable to implement adequate control systems in an efficient
and timely manner, our operations could be adversely affected and our growth
could be impaired, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.


If we are not able to hire and retain qualified personnel, or if we lose key
personnel, we may be unable to compete or grow our business.

  We believe our future success will also depend, in large part, on our ability
to identify, attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly-skilled employees,
particularly qualified sales and engineering personnel. We may not succeed in
identifying, attracting and retaining these personnel. Further, competitors and
other entities may attempt to recruit our employees. If we are unable to hire
and retain adequate staffing levels, we may not be able to increase sales of our
products, which could cause the price of our stock to decline.

  Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills and efforts
of Harry J. Carr, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Krishna
Bala, our Chief Technology Officer, and other key executive officers and members
of our senior management. These employees have critical industry experience and
relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan. We currently do
not have "key person" life insurance policies covering any of our employees. If
we lose the services of Mr. Carr, Dr. Bala or one or more of our other key
executive officers and senior management members, we may not be able to grow our
business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, causing our
stock price to decline.


If we become subject to unfair hiring claims, we could incur substantial costs
in defending ourselves.

  We may become subject to claims from companies in our industry whose employees
accept positions with us that we have engaged in unfair hiring practices or
inappropriately taken or benefited from confidential or proprietary information.
These claims may result in material litigation or judgments against us. We could
incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against these
claims, regardless of the merits of the claims. In addition, defending ourselves
from these claims could divert the attention of our management away from our
core business, which could cause our financial performance to suffer.


We do not have significant experience in international markets and may have
unexpected costs and difficulties in developing international revenues.

  We are expanding the marketing and sales of our products internationally. This
expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources
to successfully develop international sales and support channels. We will face
risks and challenges that we do not have to address in our U.S. operations,
including:

                                       14
<PAGE>

  . currency fluctuations and exchange control regulations;

  . changes in regulatory requirements in international markets;

  . expenses associated with developing and customizing our products for foreign
    countries;

  . reduced protection for intellectual property rights; and

  . compliance with international technical and regulatory standards that differ
    from domestic standards.

  If we do not successfully overcome these risks and challenges, our
international business will not achieve the revenue or profits that we expect.


We may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our existing and future
operations.

  At March 31, 2001, we had approximately $166.8 million in cash and cash
equivalents. In addition, we raised net cash proceeds of approximately $140.0
million in our initial public offering on May 17, 2001. We believe that our
available cash, our line of credit facilities and cash anticipated to be
available from future operations, will enable us to meet our working capital
requirements for the next 12 months. The development and marketing of new
products, however, and the expansion of our direct sales operation and
associated customer support organization will require a significant commitment
of resources. As a result, we may need to raise substantial additional capital.
We may not be able to obtain additional capital at all, or upon acceptable
terms. If we are unable to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, we may
be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing
and sales efforts. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the
sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of additional
securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If additional
funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, their terms could
impose additional restrictions on our operations.


If we make acquisitions, our stockholders could be diluted and we could assume
additional contingent liabilities. In addition, if we fail to successfully
integrate or manage the acquisitions we make, our business would be disrupted
and we could lose sales.

  We may, as we did with the acquisition of Astarte Fiber Networks, Inc.,
consider investments in complementary businesses, products or technologies. In
the event of any future acquisitions, we could:

  . issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders' percentage
    ownership;

  . incur debt that will give rise to interest charges and may impose material
    restrictions on the manner in which we operate our business;

                                       15
<PAGE>

  . assume liabilities;

  . incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets;
    or

  . incur large and immediate write-offs.

  We also face numerous risks, including the following, in operating and
integrating any acquired business, including Astarte:

  . problems combining the acquired operations, technologies or products;

  . diversion of management's time and attention from our core business;

  . adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and
    customers;

  . risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior
    experience; and

  . potential loss of key employees, particularly those of acquired companies.

  We may not be able to successfully integrate businesses, products,
technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future. If we fail to do
so, we could experience lost sales or disruptions to our business.


The communications industry is subject to government regulations. These
regulations could negatively affect our growth and reduce our revenues.

  Our products and our customers' products are subject to Federal Communications
Commission rules and regulations. Current and future Federal Communications
Commission rules and regulations affecting communications services or our
customers' businesses or products could negatively affect our business. In
addition, international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop
products for international service providers in the future. We may not obtain or
maintain all of the regulatory approvals that may, in the future, be required to
operate our business. Our inability to obtain these approvals, as well as any
delays caused by our compliance and our customers' compliance with regulatory
requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of our product
orders, which would significantly reduce our revenues.


Risks Related to Our Product Manufacturing

If Agere Systems Inc. stops supplying us with components, we may experience
manufacturing delays, which could harm our customer relationships.

  We currently contract with Agere Systems to supply us with optical
transceivers, a critical

                                       16
<PAGE>

component of our optical switches. Lucent Technologies, Inc., a major
stockholder of Agere, is also one of our major competitors since it develops and
markets products similar to ours. If Agere determines not to supply us with
optical transceivers because of its relationship with Lucent, we will have to
rely on other sources and may experience delays in manufacturing our products,
which could damage our customer relationships.


If we fail to predict our manufacturing and component requirements accurately,
we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could
harm our customer relationships.

  We provide forecasts of our demand to our contract manufacturers and component
vendors up to six months prior to scheduled delivery of products to our
customers. In addition, lead times for materials and components that we order
are long and depend on factors such as the procedures of, or contract terms
with, a specific supplier and demand for each component at a given time. If we
overestimate our requirements, we may have excess inventory, which could
increase our costs and harm our relationship with our contract manufacturers and
component vendors due to unexpectedly reduced future orders. If we underestimate
our requirements, we may have an inadequate inventory of components and optical
assemblies, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products, result in
delays in shipments to our customers and damage our customer relationships.


Some of the optical components used in our products may be difficult to obtain.
This could inhibit our ability to manufacture our products and we could lose
revenue and market share.

  Our industry has experienced shortages of optical components in times of high
demand. For some of these components, there previously were long waiting periods
between placement of an order and receipt of the components. If such shortages
should reoccur, component suppliers could impose allocations that limit the
number of components they supply to a given customer in a specified time period.
These suppliers could choose to increase allocations to larger, more established
companies, which could reduce our allocations and harm our ability to
manufacture our products. If we are not able to manufacture and ship our
products on a timely basis, we could lose revenue, our reputation could be
harmed and customers may find our competitors' products more attractive.


Any disruption in our manufacturing relationships may cause us to fail to meet
our customers' demands, damage our customer relationships and cause us to lose
revenue.

  We rely on a small number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our
products in accordance with our specifications and to fill orders on a timely
basis. In August 2000, we entered into an agreement to subcontract the
manufacturing of a substantial portion of our products to Solectron Corporation,
an independent manufacturer. The agreement has a one-year term, is renewable
annually and can be terminated with 90 days notice by either party. Solectron or
our other contract manufacturers may not always have sufficient quantities of
inventory

                                       17
<PAGE>

available to fill our orders or may not allocate their internal resources to
fill these orders on a timely basis.

  We currently do not have long-term contracts with any of our manufacturers. As
a result, our contract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us
for any specific period, in any specific quantity or at any specific price,
except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. If for any reason
these manufacturers were to stop satisfying our needs without providing us with
sufficient warning to procure an alternate source, our ability to sell our
products could be harmed. In addition, any failure by our contract manufacturers
to supply us with our products on a timely basis could result in late
deliveries. Our inability to meet our delivery deadlines could adversely affect
our customer relationships and, in some instances, result in termination of
these relationships or potentially subject us to litigation. Qualifying a new
contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-
consuming and could significantly interrupt the supply of our products. If we
are required or choose to change contract manufacturers, we may damage our
customer relationships and lose revenue.


We purchase several of our key components from single or limited sources. If we
are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will not be able to
meet our customers' product delivery requirements, which could harm our
reputation and decrease our sales.

  We purchase several key components from single or, in some cases, limited
sources. We do not have long-term supply contracts for these components. If any
of our sole or limited source suppliers experience capacity constraints, work
stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may not be able
or may choose not to meet our delivery schedules. Also, our suppliers may:

  . enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors;

  . be acquired by our competitors;

  . stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable
    prices;

  . refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price; or

  . be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their
    products from their suppliers.

  If supply for these key components is disrupted, we may be unable to
manufacture and deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis, which
could result in lost or delayed revenue, harm to our reputation, increased
manufacturing costs and exposure to claims by our customers. Even if alternate
suppliers are available to us, we may have difficulty identifying them in a
timely manner, we may incur significant additional expense and we may experience
difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products. Any failure to meet our
customers' delivery requirements could harm our reputation and decrease our
sales.

                                       18
<PAGE>

Our ability to compete could be jeopardized and our business plan seriously
compromised if we are unable to protect from third-party challenges the
development and maintenance of the proprietary aspects of the optical switching
products and technology we design.

  Our products utilize a variety of proprietary rights that are critical to our
competitive position. Because the technology and intellectual property
associated with our optical switching products are evolving and rapidly
changing, our current intellectual property rights may not adequately protect us
in the future. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and
trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect the intellectual
property utilized in our products. For example, we enter into confidentiality or
license agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and
customers and control access to, and distribution of, our software,
documentation and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect
our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise
obtain and use our products or technology. Also, it is possible that no patents
or trademarks will be issued from our currently pending or future patent or
trademark applications. Because legal standards relating to the validity,
enforceability and scope of protection of patent and intellectual property
rights in new technologies are uncertain and still evolving, the future
viability or value of our intellectual property rights is uncertain. Moreover,
effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be
available in some countries in which we distribute or may anticipate
distributing our products. Furthermore, our competitors may independently
develop similar technologies that limit the value of our intellectual property
or design around patents issued to us. If competitors are able to use our
technology, our competitive edge would be reduced or eliminated.


If necessary licenses of third-party technology are not available to us or are
very expensive, our products could become obsolete and our business seriously
harmed because we could have to limit or cease the development of some of our
products.

  We currently license technology from several companies that is integrated into
our products. We may occasionally be required to license additional technology
from third parties or expand the scope of current licenses to sell or develop
our products. Existing and future third-party licenses may not be available to
us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The loss of our current
technology licenses or our inability to expand or obtain any third-party license
required to sell or develop our products could require us to obtain substitute
technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost or limit
or cease the sale or development of certain products or services. If these
events occur, we may not be able to increase our sales and our revenue could
decline.


Risks Related to this Offering

Insiders have substantial control over us and could limit your ability to
influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.

                                       19
<PAGE>

  Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders and entities
affiliated with them own approximately 47.1% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, may influence
matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of
directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination
transactions. These stockholders or their affiliates may acquire additional
equity in the future. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of
delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could
deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common
stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market
price of our common stock.


The trading price for our common stock is likely to be highly volatile. This
makes your investment in our common stock more risky and litigation more likely.

  We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will
be sustained. The price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may
fluctuate substantially depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our
control. In particular, changes in general economic conditions as well as those
specific to our industry, the limited amount of our product sales and the
limited number of customers and/or the announcement of any significant customer
developments, awards or losses or of any significant partnerships or
acquisitions by us or our competitors could have a material adverse effect on
our trading price. In addition, the market for technology companies, including
companies whose business involves some aspect of optical networking, has
recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations, which often have
been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those
companies. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a
company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought
against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may
be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation
could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and
resources from our business.


A substantial number of shares will become available for sale, and if these
shares are sold in a short period of time, the market price of our common stock
could decline.

  If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market
price of our common stock could decrease.  As of June 30, 2001, we had
outstanding 110,871,024 shares of common stock.  Most of our stockholders are
subject to agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering or us
that restrict their ability to transfer their stock for periods ranging from 90
to 180 days from May 17, 2001, the date of our initial public offering, with
some exceptions.  After all of these agreements expire, an aggregate of
82,452,635 shares will be eligible for sale in the public market.

  Tellium is not selling any shares of common stock under this prospectus and,
except as disclosed below, will not receive any proceeds from sales of common
stock made by selling stockholders under this prospectus.

  We may receive proceeds in connection with sales of common stock by Corning
Incorporated, one of the selling stockholders, which owns 666,666 shares of our
common stock.  Corning  is obligated under the terms of a supply agreement to
(1) sell all of its shares of Tellium common stock by August 15, 2002 and (2)
pay us 30.5% of their pre-tax profits from these sales.  The supply agreement
also requires Corning to supply Tellium with optical switch module products and
may be terminated by either party upon a material breach by the other party. In
addition, we will receive proceeds if Qwest Investment Company exercises its
warrants to purchase shares of common stock to be resold.  We intend to use any
proceeds we receive from Corning or any warrant exercises for general corporate
purposes.


                                DIVIDEND POLICY

  We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock or
other securities and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the
expansion and development of our business.

                    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
                 FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with "Selected Financial Data" and
our financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this
prospectus.


Overview

  We design, develop and market high-speed, high-capacity, intelligent optical
switches that enable network service providers to quickly and cost-effectively
deliver new high-speed services. Our product line consists of several hardware
products and related software tools. From May 1997 to September 1999, we
developed and manufactured dense wave division multiplexing products and the
initial versions of our Aurora 32 optical switch for the U.S. Department of
Defense. Accordingly, substantially all of our revenue in 1998 and the first two
quarters of 1999 was derived from product sales to Telcordia Technologies, Inc.,
in connection with a project with the U.S. Department of Defense. All of our
obligations under this contract have been satisfied, and we do not anticipate
recognizing future revenue from equipment and product sales under this contract.
During the second quarter of 1999, we decided to focus on the development of
optical switches and discontinued the manufacture of dense wave division
multiplexing products. In September 1999, we shipped our Aurora 32 optical
switch to Extant, and in the third and fourth quarters of 2000, we delivered our
next-generation Aurora Optical Switch to Extant and Qwest, respectively, for
evaluation in their laboratories. In the second quarter of 2001, we shipped our
Aurora 128 to Dynegy Connect. We currently market and sell all of these
products. Our future revenue growth depends on the commercial success of our
optical switches. Although we are developing and plan to introduce new products
and enhancements, we may not be successful in these efforts.

  We have minimum commitment or exclusivity contracts with the following three
customers: Cable & Wireless, Dynegy Connect, an affiliate of Dynegy Global
Communications, and Qwest. In September 2000, we entered into a five-year
contract with Cable & Wireless, a multinational provider of voice, data and
network services. Under the terms of this contract, Cable & Wireless has a
minimum purchase commitment of $350 million for the worldwide deployment of our
products, including the Aurora Optical Switch, the StarNet Wavelength Management
System and the StarNet Operating System. Cable & Wireless is conducting
laboratory testing of the Aurora Optical Switch at our facilities. We expect to
commence commercial shipment to Cable & Wireless during the second half of 2001.
In September 1999, we entered into a five-year contract with Extant. On
September 29, 2000, Extant was acquired by Dynegy Global Communications, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dynegy, a publicly-traded energy company. As part of
the acquisition, our contract with Extant was transferred to Dynegy Connect, a
limited partnership owned 80% by subsidiaries of Dynegy and 20% by Telstra
Corporation, an Australian telecommunications and information services company.
Dynegy is proceeding with Extant's planned network build-out. We expect Dynegy
Connect will purchase approximately $250 million of products under the contract,
although it has no obligation to do so. However, under the

                                       25
<PAGE>

terms of this contract, Dynegy Connect is required to purchase its full
requirements for optical switches from us until November 1, 2003. Our Aurora 32
optical switch, StarNet Wavelength Management System, StarNet Design Tools and
StarNet Operating System have been in service in the Dynegy Connect network
since April 2000. Dynegy Connect conducted laboratory testing on the Aurora
Optical Switch during the first quarter of 2001. We commenced commercial
shipment to Dynegy Connect of the Aurora Optical Switch during the first quarter
of 2001 and of the Aurora 128 in the second quarter of 2001. We have a five-year
contract with Qwest, a multinational provider of voice, data and network
services. Under the terms of this contract, Qwest has a minimum purchase
commitment of $300 million over the first three years of the contract and,
subject to extensions under a limited circumstance, an additional $100 million
over the following two years of the contract for the deployment of our products,
including the Aurora Optical Switch, the StarNet Wavelength Management System,
the Aurora Full-Spectrum and the StarNet Operating System. Qwest began
conducting laboratory testing of the Aurora Optical Switch in the fourth quarter
of 2000, and we commenced commercial shipment under this contract during the
first quarter of 2001.

  We sell our products through a direct sales force. We anticipate expanding our
sales efforts to include resellers and distribution partners in the United
States and selected international markets. Customers' decisions to purchase our
products to deploy in commercial networks involve a significant commitment of
resources and a lengthy evaluation, testing and product qualification process.
We believe these long sales cycles, as well as our expectation that customers
will tend to sporadically place large orders with short lead times, will cause
our revenue and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly
from quarter to quarter. In addition, we expect our revenues will be generated
by sales to a limited number of customers for the foreseeable future.

  Since our inception, we have incurred significant losses and as of March 31,
2001, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $206.0 million. We have not
achieved profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis and anticipate that we
will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We have a lengthy
sales cycle for our products and, accordingly, we expect to incur sales related
costs and other expenses before we realize the related revenue. We also expect
to incur significant sales and marketing, research and development and general
and administrative expenses and, as a result, we will need to generate
significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.

  On October 10, 2000, we acquired Astarte and issued 3,749,942 shares of our
common stock to the former stockholders of Astarte in connection with this
acquisition, 749,937 of which are escrowed to secure indemnity obligations of
the former stockholders of Astarte. The principal assets of Astarte that we
acquired are intellectual property rights and goodwill.


 Revenue

  Our revenue is derived from the sale of optical switches and related software
and the provision of related services. We recognize revenue from equipment sales
when the product has been shipped. For transactions where we have not obtained
customer acceptance, revenue is

                                       26
<PAGE>

deferred until the terms of acceptance are satisfied.

  Software license revenue for software embedded within our optical switches or
our stand-alone software products is recognized when a purchase order has been
received or a sales contract has been executed, delivery of the product and
acceptance by the customer have occurred, the license fees are fixed and
determinable and collection is probable. The portion of revenue that relates to
our obligations to provide customer support, if any, are deferred, based upon
the price charged for customer support when it is sold separately and recognized
ratably over the maintenance period. Amounts received in excess of revenue
recognized are included as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. Revenue from
technical support and maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably
over the maintenance period. Maintenance and warranty periods are generally one
year and five years, respectively. Estimated warranty costs are recorded as a
cost of revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized.


 Non-Cash Charges Related to Equity Issuances

  Non-cash charges related to warrants issued to customers significantly affect
our reporting of revenue. In conjunction with the execution of our contract with
Extant in September 1999, we granted a warrant to purchase up to 5,226,000
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.05 per share. The contract
with Extant was subsequently transferred to Dynegy Connect. Upon execution of
that contract, 1,045,200 of the shares subject to the warrant vested, and as
there was no purchase commitment, a charge of approximately $1.1 million was
recorded to selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 1999
to reflect the fair value of the vested shares subject to the warrant at the
grant date. As the vesting of the remaining shares subject to the warrant was
initially dependent upon future purchases made by the customer, variable
accounting was required. As of November 2, 2000, we amended the warrant
agreement to immediately vest all of the remaining shares subject to the
warrant. The revised agreement provides that the warrant becomes exercisable
based on the schedule of milestones previously contained in the warrant. If the
milestones are not reached by March 31, 2005, the remaining unexercised shares
subject to the warrant shall then become exercisable. In connection with the
execution of this amendment, we expect to incur a non-cash charge of
approximately $90.6 million. This charge will be recorded as a reduction of
revenue as we realize revenue from this contract. The amount of the charge was
calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Charges of approximately $584,000,
$2.4 million and $4.3 million were recorded as an offset to revenue for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and December 31, 2000 and for the three months
ended March 31, 2001, respectively, to reflect the fair market value of the
shares subject to the warrant earned by Extant based upon purchases through that
date.

  In conjunction with our agreement with Qwest, we issued three warrants to a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Qwest for a total of 2,375,000 shares of our common
stock exercisable at $14.00 per share. The fair market value of the shares
subject to the warrants as calculated using the Black-Scholes model,
approximately $38.0 million, will be recorded as an offset to revenue as Qwest
makes purchases under the contract. Charges of approximately $328,000 and
$531,000 were recorded as an offset to revenue for the year ended December 31,
2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. Two of the
warrants for a total of 2,000,000 shares

                                       27
<PAGE>

of our common stock are reflected on our books as of March 31, 2001. In April
2001, the third warrant was issued for an additional 375,000 shares of our
common stock.


 Cost of Revenue

  Our cost of revenue includes manufacturing expenses, which consist of amounts
paid to third-party manufacturers for assembly and testing, warranty and
maintenance expense, manufacturing start-up expenses, manufacturing personnel
and related costs and costs of our customer support group. A significant portion
of our manufacturing expenses consists of payments to third-party contract
manufacturers.

  We anticipate our cost of revenue to increase in future periods as our revenue
increases. We believe that our gross margins will be affected by several factors
including:

  . the demand for our products;

  . new product introductions both by us and by our competitors;

  . changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors;

  . the mix of product configurations sold;

  . the volume of manufacturing;

  . our ability to reduce our manufacturing and component costs; and

  . non-cash charges related to customer warrants.


 Research and Development Expense

  Research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related
personnel costs, prototype costs and other costs related to the design,
development, testing and enhancement of our products. We have expensed our
research and development costs as they were incurred. Several components of our
research and development effort, including the purchase of testing equipment for
our products, require significant expenditures, the timing of which can cause
variability in our quarterly expenses. We are devoting substantial resources to
the continued development and enhancement of our products. We believe that
research and development is critical to our strategic product development
objectives, and we intend to enhance our technology to meet the changing
requirements of our customers. As a result, we expect our research and
development expense to increase in absolute dollars in the future.


 Sales and Marketing Expense

                                       28
<PAGE>

  Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and the related
costs of sales and marketing personnel, commissions, promotions, travel and
other marketing expenses and recruiting expenses. We expect that sales and
marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase
our direct sales efforts, expand our operations internationally, hire additional
sales and marketing personnel, initiate additional marketing programs and
establish sales offices in new locations.


 General and Administrative Expense

  General and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related
expenses for personnel, recruiting expenses and professional fees. We expect
that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we
add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business
and our operation as a public company.


 Amortization of Intangible Assets and Goodwill

  In September 2000, we recorded approximately $45.0 million of intangible
assets related to our acquisition of an intellectual property license from AT&T.
In the fourth quarter of 2000, we recorded approximately $113.3 million of
goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of Astarte. We
recorded approximately $7.9 million of amortization expense for goodwill and
intangible assets related to our acquisition of an intellectual property license
from AT&T and our acquisition of Astarte in the three months ended March 31,
2001. We expect to amortize the remaining amounts on the statement of operations
in future periods in the approximate amounts as follows:

  . 2001--$23.8 million;

  . 2002--$31.7 million; and

  . 2003-05--$86.9 million.


 Stock-Based Compensation Expense

  During 1998 and 1999, we recorded deferred stock-based compensation expense of
approximately $2.1 million and $14.4 million, respectively. We recorded
additional deferred compensation expense of approximately $221.2 million and
$8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended
March 31, 2001, respectively. This deferred compensation expense does not
reflect the impact of stock options to purchase shares of common stock granted
to employees and non-employees that vest upon the attainment of performance
criteria. At this time, it is not possible to determine the total compensation
expense associated with these options as it will be based in part on the fair
market value of our common stock on the date the performance criteria is met.
Deferred stock-based compensation expense consists of charges resulting from the
grant of stock options and the issuance of restricted shares with

                                       29
<PAGE>

exercise or sales prices deemed to be below the fair value of our common stock
on the date of grant. These amounts are being amortized ratably over the vesting
periods of the applicable options, which vary depending on vesting schedules.
Typically, 25% of the options granted vest on the first anniversary of the date
of grant and the remainder vest at either 1/36 monthly thereafter or 25% on each
anniversary of the grant date.

  As a result of our stock option grants and based on the unamortized deferred
compensation expense as of March 31, 2001, we expect to recognize additional
deferred compensation in future periods in the approximate amounts as follows:

  . 2001--$43.5 million;

  . 2002--$55.2 million;

  . 2003--$53.9 million;

  . 2004--$38.6 million; and

  . 2005--$0.1 million.

  The amortization of deferred stock-based compensation expense is allocated to
cost of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing or general and
administrative expense, as appropriate.


Recent Developments

  On May 17, 2001, we completed an initial public offering of our common stock,
which generated net cash proceeds of approximately $140.0 million.

  On July 18, 2001, we issued a press release reporting our results for the
quarter ended June 30, 2001.  Revenues were $30.4 million during the quarter, an
increase of 95% over our first quarter 2001 revenues of $15.6 million.  On a
pro forma cash basis (before non-cash charges related to equity issuances,
stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, and amortization), gross margins
rose to $12.8 million in the second quarter of 2001, or 42% of revenues,
increasing from $6.3 million, or 40% of revenues, in the first quarter of 2001.

  Operating losses on a pro forma cash basis were $15.3 million during the
second quarter, compared with $22.5 million during the first quarter of 2001.
Including non-cash charges, operating losses were $53.8 million during the
second quarter, versus $52.5 million during the first quarter.

  Our net loss on a pro forma cash basis during the second quarter of 2001 was
$13.0 million, versus $19.8 million during the first quarter.  Including non-
cash charges, the company's net loss for the second quarter was $51.5 million,
versus a net loss of $49.8 million in the preceding quarter.  On a per-share
basis, Tellium's net loss on a pro forma cash basis during the second quarter
was $0.09 and including non-cash charges, was $0.37.

                                       30

Results of Operations

  We plan to continue to increase our operating expenses significantly in order
to fund greater levels of research and development, expand our sales and
marketing operations, broaden our customer support capabilities and develop new
distribution channels. We also plan to expand our general and administrative
functions to address the increased reporting and other administrative demands
that will result from being a publicly traded company and the increasing size of
our business. Our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue
trends and a high percentage of our expenses are, and will continue to be, fixed
in the short term. In addition, we expect to generate revenues from a limited
number of customers for the foreseeable future. As a result of these factors, we
expect to continue generating operating losses in the short term.

 Three Months Ended March 31, 2001 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2000

  Revenue

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we recognized revenue of
approximately $15.6 million. This represents an increase of approximately $12.2
million compared to the same period in 2000. The increase is due to the sales of
our Aurora Optical Switch to Dynegy Connect and Qwest in 2001, which generated
revenues of approximately $15.4 million compared to Aurora 32 product sales of
$3.4 million in the same period in 2000. We expect revenue to increase over time
as our customers continue to order products under their contracts. In 2001, we
expect our revenue to be higher than in 2000 and that substantially all of our
revenue will come from three customers.


  Cost of Revenue

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we incurred cost of revenue of
approximately $10.7 million, which represented an increase of approximately $8.5
million from the same period in 2000. The increase was directly related to the
corresponding increase in revenue and includes increased material costs of
approximately $3.4 million, increased personnel costs of approximately $1.6
million and increased overhead costs of approximately $2.3 million. Cost of
revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2001 includes amortization of
stock-based compensation of approximately $1.4 million. We expect our cost of
revenue to increase as our

                                       32
<PAGE>

revenue increases. We expect our revenue growth to exceed our cost of revenue
growth in 2001, although actual results could vary significantly depending on
changing conditions in our business.


  Research and Development Expense

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we incurred research and
development expense of approximately $16.6 million, of which approximately $10.2
million represented personnel costs and approximately $3.1 million represented
prototype development expense. Our research and development expense for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 represented an increase of approximately $12.6
million over the same period in 2000. The increase is attributed primarily to an
increase in personnel costs of approximately $7.5 million and an increase of
approximately $1.9 million related to prototype expenses for the design and
development of our Aurora Optical Switch. As of March 31, 2001, the number of
employees dedicated to research and development was 280, as compared to 84 at
March 31, 2000. We expect our research and development expense to continue to
increase in absolute dollars, although we expect research and development
expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time. We presently intend to
use approximately $60.0 to $70.0 million of the net proceeds from our recent
initial public offering to expand our research and development efforts. This
amount will vary significantly depending on changing conditions in our business.
We expect that our research and development expense in 2001 will be at least
equal to research and development expense in 2000.


  Sales and Marketing Expense

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we incurred sales and marketing
expense of approximately $7.7 million, of which approximately $4.8 million
represented personnel costs and approximately $2.1 million represented costs
related to marketing programs. This represented an increase in sales and
marketing expense of approximately $6.7 million over the same period in 2000.
The increase resulted primarily from approximately $4.4 million of costs
associated with the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel, as well
as increases in marketing program costs of approximately $1.6 million. Marketing
program costs included an increase of approximately $0.8 million for travel and
$0.4 million for advertising and promotion. As of March 31, 2001, the number of
sales and marketing personnel was 78 people, as compared to 25 people at March
31, 2000. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute
dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue over time.


  General and Administrative Expense

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we incurred general and
administrative expense of approximately $5.8 million, of which approximately
$1.8 million represented expenses for personnel, approximately $1.1 million for
professional fees and approximately $1.0 million represented depreciation. Our
general and administrative expense for the three months ended March 31, 2001
represented an increase of approximately $3.9 million over the same period in

                                       33
<PAGE>

2000, of which approximately $1.1 million resulted from the hiring of additional
general and administrative personnel, approximately $0.8 million resulted from
increased professional fees and services and approximately $0.6 million
represented increased depreciation. We expect our general and administrative
expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of revenue
over time.


  Amortization of Intangible Assets and Goodwill

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we incurred amortization expense of
approximately $7.9 million, of which approximately $5.6 million related to the
goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of Astarte and
approximately $2.3 million related to the acquisition of an intellectual
property license from AT&T. We did not incur any amortization expense during the
same period in 2000. We expect to incur similar charges over the amortization
periods of the related goodwill and intangible assets and that for the full year
2001, amortization expense will be approximately $31.7 million.


  Stock-Based Compensation Expense

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we recorded approximately $14.6
million of stock-based compensation expense. This represents an increase of
approximately $9.9 million over the same period in 2000. The increase resulted
primarily from the issuance of additional options with an exercise price less
than the deemed fair market value of our stock at the time of the grant. We
currently expect to incur similar charges in future periods and that stock-based
compensation expense for the full year 2001 will be approximately $62.0 million.


  Interest Income, Net

  For the three months ended March 31, 2001, we recorded interest income, net of
interest expense, of approximately $2.7 million, as compared to interest income,
net of interest expense, of approximately $0.7 million for the same period in
2000. Net interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash
equivalent balances offset by interest expense related to outstanding
borrowings. The increase in our interest income for this period is primarily
attributable to the interest income on the cash proceeds from our Series D
preferred stock issuance in December 1999 and January 2000 and our Series E
preferred stock issuance in September 2000. This interest income was offset by
interest expense related to an equipment financing arrangement we secured in
November 1999 for up to $6.0 million.


  Income Taxes

  We have recorded no income tax provision or benefit for the three month period
ended March 31, 2001 due to our operating loss position and the uncertainty of
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards.

 Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999

  Revenue

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recognized revenue in the amount of
approximately $15.6 million. This represents an increase of approximately $10.4
million compared to the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase was
primarily due to increased sales of our Aurora 32 optical switches to Dynegy and
sales of our Aurora Optical Switch to Dynegy and Qwest in 2000. Our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2000 consisted of approximately $7.3 million related
to Aurora 32 product sales and approximately $6.2 million related to Aurora
Optical Switch product sales. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we
recognized revenue of approximately $5.2 million, of which approximately $3.2
million related to Aurora 32 product sales and approximately $2.0 million to our
contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recognized as an offset to revenue of
approximately $2.8 million of non-cash charges related to the warrants issued to
Dynegy Global Communications and Qwest compared to approximately $584,000 for
the year ended December 31, 1999.


  Cost of Revenue

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred cost of revenue of
approximately $15.7 million, which represented an increase of approximately
$11.8 million over the same period in 1999. This increase was directly related
to the corresponding increase in revenue. The increase was primarily due to an
increase in material costs of approximately $6.1 million, manufacturing expense
of approximately $3.2 million and personnel costs of approximately $1.4 million.
Cost of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 includes amortization of
stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.2 million compared to
charges of approximately $85,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.


  Research and Development Expense

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred research and development
expense of approximately $43.6 million, of which approximately $17.6 million
represented personnel costs and approximately $23.0 million represented
prototype development expense. This represented an increase of approximately
$34.0 million over the same period in 1999. The increased expenses were
primarily associated with a significant increase in personnel-related expenses
of approximately $11.8 million and an increase of approximately $20.0 million in
prototype expenses for the design and development of our Aurora Optical Switch.
As of December 31, 2000, the number of employees dedicated to research and
development was 249, as compared to 59 at December 31, 1999.

                                       35

  Sales and Marketing Expense

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred sales and marketing expense
of approximately $14.0 million, of which approximately $7.1 million represented
personnel costs and approximately $5.7 million represented costs related to
marketing programs. This represented an increase of approximately $10.2 million
over the same period in 1999. The increase resulted from costs associated with
the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel of approximately $5.7
million as well as marketing program costs. Increases in marketing program costs
included an increase of approximately $1.2 million for travel, approximately
$300,000 for outside consulting services and approximately $2.9 million on
advertising and promotion. Sales and marketing expense for the year ended
December 31, 1999 included a charge of approximately $1.1 million related to the
issuance of a warrant to a customer. As of December 31, 2000, the number of
sales and marketing personnel was 70 people, as compared to 11 people at
December 31, 1999.


  General and Administrative Expense

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred general and administrative
expense of approximately $15.9 million, of which approximately $4.5 million
represented expenses for personnel, approximately $3.6 million represented
professional fees and approximately $1.5 million represented depreciation. This
represented an increase of approximately $11.5 million from the same period in
1999. Approximately $3.1 million resulted from the hiring of additional general
and administrative personnel and approximately $2.4 million resulted from
increased professional fees.


  Amortization of Intangible Assets and Goodwill

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we incurred amortization expense of
approximately $8.0 million, of which approximately $3.0 million related to the
acquisition of an intellectual property license from AT&T and approximately $5.0
million related to the goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition
of Astarte. We did not incur any amortization expense during the year ended
December 31, 1999.


  Stock-Based Compensation Expense

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded approximately $32.9 million
stock-based compensation expense. This represents an increase of approximately
$30.1 million over the same period in 1999. The increase resulted primarily from
the issuance of additional options during the year ended December 31, 2000 with
an exercise price less than the deemed fair market value of our stock at the
time of the grant.


  Interest Income, Net

                                       36
<PAGE>

  For the year ended December 31, 2000, we recorded interest income, net of
interest expense, of approximately $7.0 million, as compared to net interest
expense of approximately $162,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999. Net
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent
balances offset by interest expense related to outstanding borrowings. The
increase in our interest income for the year ended December 31, 2000 is
primarily attributable to the interest income on the cash proceeds from our
Series D preferred stock issuance in December 1999 and January 2000 and Series E
preferred stock issuance in September 2000. This interest income was offset by
interest expense related to an equipment financing arrangement we secured in
November 1999 for up to $6.0 million.


  Income Taxes

  We have recorded no income tax provision or benefit for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 2000 due to our operating loss position and the
uncertainty of our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards.


  Period From Inception (May 8, 1997) Through December 31, 1997, the Year Ended
December 31, 1998 and the Year Ended December 31, 1999

  Revenue

  In 1997, we recognized revenue of approximately $54,600 related to consulting
work we performed for an affiliate. In 1998, we recognized approximately $1.4
million in revenue under our contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.

  In 1999, we recognized revenue of approximately $5.2 million, which comprised
approximately $964,000 in revenue recognized under our contract with Telcordia
Technologies in connection with a project with the U.S. Department of Defense,
approximately $3.1 million in revenue from shipments of our Aurora 32 optical
switches and related software to Extant and approximately $1.1 million in
revenue from the sale of our remaining dense wave division multiplexing
inventory.

  In 1999, we recognized an offset to revenue of approximately $584,000 of non-
cash charges related to the warrant issued to Extant.


  Cost of Revenue

  Cost of revenue was approximately $11,500 in 1997. In 1998, we incurred cost
of revenue of approximately $1.3 million.

  In 1999, we incurred cost of revenue of approximately $3.9 million, of which
approximately $1.3 million represented materials, approximately $2.5 million
represented labor and production

                                       37
<PAGE>

overhead, approximately $283,000 represented warranty and obsolescence costs and
approximately $85,000 represented amortization of deferred stock-based
compensation expense.


  Research and Development Expense

  Research and development expense was approximately $4.5 million in 1997. In
1998, we incurred research and development expense of approximately $14.5
million.

  In 1999, we incurred research and development expense of approximately $9.6
million, of which approximately $5.7 million represented personnel costs,
approximately $3.0 million represented prototype development expenses and
approximately $100,000 represented costs for technical consultants. Research and
development expenses represented approximately 71%, 69% and 47% of total
operating expenses for 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively. The decrease in
expenses in 1999 relative to 1998 was attributable to costs incurred in 1998
related to the purchase, development and fabrication of dense wave division
multiplexing products, which were discontinued in 1999. This decrease was offset
by increased costs associated with a significant increase in personnel and
personnel-related expenses.


  Sales and Marketing Expense

  Sales and marketing expense was approximately $202,000 in 1997. In 1998, we
incurred sales and marketing expense of approximately $1.9 million.

  In 1999, we incurred sales and marketing expense of approximately $3.8
million, of which approximately $1.4 million represented expenses for sales and
marketing personnel, approximately $1.0 million represented costs related to
marketing programs and approximately $1.1 million related to a charge for the
fair value of a warrant issued to a customer. Sales and marketing expenses
represented approximately 3%, 9% and 19% of total operating expenses for 1997,
1998 and 1999, respectively. The increase in expense in 1999 represents the
hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel, sales-based commissions and
marketing program costs, including trade shows and product launch activities.


  General and Administrative Expense

  General and administrative expense was approximately $1.7 million in 1997. In
1998, we incurred general and administrative expense of approximately $3.6
million.

  In 1999, we incurred general and administrative expense of approximately $4.4
million, of which approximately $1.3 million represented expenses for personnel
costs and approximately $1.2 million professional fees, approximately $300,000
represented rent and maintenance costs and approximately $500,000 represented
depreciation. General and administrative expenses represented approximately 26%,
17% and 21% of total operating expenses in 1997, 1998 and 1999, respectively.
The increase in expense in 1999 reflects the hiring of additional

                                       38
<PAGE>

administrative personnel and expenses incurred in connection with our growing
operations as well as increased rent and associated costs related to moving to
larger facilities.


  Stock-Based Compensation Expense

  We recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $950,000 in 1998
and approximately $2.9 million in 1999. There was no amortization of deferred
stock compensation in 1997. Stock-based compensation expense increased over
these periods primarily because we granted stock options with exercise prices
below the deemed fair market value of our stock at the time of the grant.


  Interest Income (Expense), Net

  Interest income, net of interest expense, was approximately $303,000 in 1997,
approximately $266,000 in 1998 and approximately ($162,000) in 1999. The
significant decrease in 1999 relates to our decreasing cash reserves in 1999 as
well as the increased interest expense related to a $5.0 million loan in 1999.


  Other Income

  Other income was approximately $802,000 in 1997, which included approximately
$600,000 related to fees paid to us under a non-exclusive license agreement.


  Income Taxes

  We have recorded no income tax provision or benefit for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 due to our operating loss position and the
uncertainty of our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

  Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private
sales of our capital stock. As of March 31, 2001, our cash and cash equivalents
totaled approximately $166.8 million and our working capital totaled
approximately $141.7 million.

  Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31,
2001 was approximately $9.2 million, including amounts received in excess of
revenue recognized for product shipped but not yet accepted. Cash used in
operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2000 was approximately
$80.0 million. The use of cash in operating activities for the year ended
December 31, 2000 related primarily to investment in the growth of our business.

                                       39
<PAGE>

  Cash used in investing activities was approximately $30.2 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2001 and approximately $12.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000. The increase in net cash used for investing activities
reflected increased purchases of property and equipment primarily for computers
and test equipment for our development and manufacturing activities.

  Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2001
was approximately $373,000. Cash provided by financing activities for the year
ended December 31, 2000 was approximately $235.1 million. In January 2000, we
issued an additional $5.0 million of Series D preferred stock and in June 2000,
we issued approximately $4.1 million of Series A preferred stock to existing
shareholders upon the exercise of warrants. In September 2000, we raised net
proceeds of approximately $212.5 million from the sale of our Series E preferred
stock. For the year ended December 31, 2000, we raised net proceeds of
approximately $10.9 million from the sale of our common stock.

  Between December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001, our inventory increased by
approximately $38.2 million. This increase was primarily a result of an increase
in raw materials and work-in-process attributable to our efforts to prepare for
anticipated customer orders beginning in the first half of 2001. Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities also increased between December 31, 2000
and March 31, 2001 by approximately $40.1 million, which consists primarily of
deferred revenue for amounts received from customers for products shipped but
not yet accepted.

  In November 1999, we entered into a lease line of credit with Comdisco that
allows us to finance up to $4.0 million of equipment purchases. The line bears
an interest rate of 7.5% and expires in November 2002. As of December 31, 2000
and March 31, 2001, approximately $3.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively,
were outstanding under this facility.

  During the year ended December 31, 2000, we entered into a $10.0 million line
of credit with Commerce Bank. The line of credit bears interest at 6.75% and
expires on June 30, 2002. As of December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001,
approximately $4.0 million was outstanding under this line of credit.

  We expect to use our available cash, our line of credit facilities and cash
anticipated to be available from future operations, primarily to fund operating
losses and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of our available cash to acquire or invest in businesses,
technologies or products that are complementary to our business. We have not
determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the uses described above or
the timing of these expenditures.

  We believe that our available cash, our line of credit facilities and cash
anticipated to be available from future operations, will enable us to meet our
working capital requirements for the next 12 months. Our expenses have exceeded,
and in the foreseeable future are expected to exceed, our revenue. Accordingly,
we do not expect to be able to fund our operations solely from internally-
generated funds for the foreseeable future. Our future liquidity and capital
requirements will depend upon numerous factors, including expansion of

acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies, although we currently
have no commitments or agreements for any cash acquisitions. If capital
requirements vary materially from those currently planned, we may require
additional financing sooner than anticipated. Any additional equity financing
may be dilutive to our stockholders and debt financing, if available, may
involve restrictive covenants with respect to dividends, raising capital and
other financial and operational matters that could restrict our operations.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

  In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS 137, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 133 and SFAS 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities--an amendment of FASB Statement No.
133. This statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for
derivative instruments and requires recognition of all derivatives as assets or
liabilities in the statement of financial position and measurement of these
instruments at fair value. The statement, as amended, is effective for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2000. We adopted this standard, as amended, on
January 1, 2001. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as no transition
adjustment was required.

  In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" ("SAB
101"), which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation and disclosure
of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101 outlines the
basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides guidance for
disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. We have reviewed these
criteria and believe our policies for revenue recognition are in accordance with
SAB 101.


Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk

  We have assessed our vulnerability to market risks, including interest rate
risk associated with financial instruments included in cash and cash
equivalents. Due to the short-term nature of these investments and other
investment policies and procedures, we have determined that the risks associated
with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments are not
material to our business.

Overview

  We design, develop and market high-speed, high-capacity, intelligent optical
switches that enable telecommunications service providers to quickly and cost-
effectively deliver new high-speed services. Intelligent optical switches are
products that are installed in the core, or center, of telecommunications
networks to manage the flow of optical signals, which are beams of light
transmitted over fiber optic cables. With the growth of the Internet and the
global deregulation of telecommunications services, there continues to be a
dramatic increase in data traffic, as well as accelerating demand for new and
complex services and network capacity. Our service provider customers are under
increasing pressure to improve and expand data services and to upgrade their
networks in a timely and cost-effective manner. We believe that the network
equipment that service providers are currently using does not offer them
sufficient flexibility to improve their data service offerings and upgrade their
networks in a timely and cost-effective manner.

  Our products include highly reliable hardware, standards-based operating
software and integrated network planning and network management tools designed
to deliver intelligent optical switching for public telecommunications networks.
Our products are specifically designed to manage very high-speed optical signals
and can be easily expanded, enabling service providers to grow and manage their
networks quickly and efficiently to keep pace with dynamic requirements of data
services. We have designed our products to be cost-effective for emerging
service providers as they begin to build out their networks, as well as for
established service providers to expand and enhance the capabilities of their
existing networks. Our optical switches operate with existing optical networking
equipment to support the transition from older networks to advanced, intelligent
optical networks without service disruption. This capability protects service
providers' prior investment in fiber optics and transmission equipment. Our
optical switches are easily upgraded, providing our customers with the ability
to adopt new technologies and features without the need to replace our
equipment.


Industry Background

 Increase in Data Traffic is Leading to Increased Demand for Network Capacity

  The rapid global adoption of the Internet and the World Wide Web is increasing
data traffic in the world's public telecommunications networks. Consumers and
businesses are increasingly using the Internet for applications such as
electronic mail, electronic commerce and other voice, video and data services.
This additional traffic demand is expected to accelerate with the development,
deployment and increased use of high-capacity network access technologies, such
as cable modems and digital subscriber lines, that enable commercial and
consumer users to transmit and receive large volumes of information. Substantial
growth is expected to increase the demand for capacity, or bandwidth, at all
levels of public networks.

                                       42

 Deregulation Has Resulted in Increased Competition

  Deregulation of the telecommunications industry worldwide has opened markets
to new providers and permitted existing service providers to offer competing
services in expanded geographic areas. The ability to create and offer new
services quickly and cost-effectively has become an important competitive
advantage among service providers. Competition has also reduced prices for
service offerings, decreasing margins and forcing service providers to look to
new technology to provide increased operating efficiencies.


Today's Optical Network

  Optical networking refers to the use of fiber optic cables and connections
that use light, rather than electricity, to transfer information. These fiber
optic cables are connected to equipment that sends the streams of data carried
by light over the fiber optic cables. The high performance of optical networking
has led to rapid deployment of fiber optic networks.

  Today, service providers employ two primary methods for managing and
transporting traffic within their optical networks. SONET/SDH, which stands for
synchronous optical network/synchronous digital hierarchy, is used to provide
operational features. DWDM, which stands for dense wave division multiplexing,
is used to add capacity.

  SONET, in North America, and SDH, in Europe and other countries, are standards
that govern the management of traffic within an optical network. SONET/SDH
equipment combines multiple, low-speed signals into higher-speed connections to
transport these signals across the optical network. SONET/SDH also provides the
ability to restore services in the event of failures in the signal path.

  Dense wave division multiplexing is an optical transport technology that
dramatically multiplies the amount of traffic that can be carried over a fiber
optic network by dividing each beam of light into multiple, discrete beams of
light, referred to as channels. Service providers have widely deployed dense
wave division multiplexing technology to increase capacity within their long-
distance networks. However, as hundreds of channels are added across the
network, complexities and inefficiencies increase. Dense wave division
multiplexing equipment alone is incapable of performing key functions that
SONET/SDH equipment performs, such as performance monitoring, identification of
faults and restoration of service, that ensure reliable network operations. For
this reason, service providers have typically deployed both SONET/SDH and dense
wave division multiplexing equipment in their optical networks.


Limitations of Existing Optical Networks

  Many aspects of today's network designs limit service providers' ability to
cost effectively expand their networks and efficiently meet increasing capacity
and service demands. The following are key limitations of the existing networks:

                                       43
<PAGE>

  . SONET/SDH systems were designed to support voice traffic. SONET/SDH systems
    combine multiple dedicated voice channels into higher-speed channels. While
    this approach provides quality delivery of traditional voice traffic,
    SONET/SDH standards are very inefficient for unpredictable and dynamic data
    traffic that does not fit neatly into channels. Moreover, the multiple
    signals are broken down and recombined at every network intersection,
    negatively impacting performance of the network. Data traffic exhibits
    enormous peaks in demand that SONET/SDH standards cannot support in an
    efficient manner at reasonable cost.

  . Current networks use a ring design. SONET/SDH equipment is typically set up
    in what is called a ring to connect several intersections in a network.
    Optical paths are linked in rings so that in the event of a single fiber cut
    or single equipment failure between two points on the ring, the signal can
    be immediately directed through another path, called the protection path of
    the ring. However, there are several disadvantages to ring networks. The
    delivery of high-speed services across many of these network intersections
    takes months to test and deploy due to the amount and complexity of the
    equipment that must be connected to the rings. In addition, for every
    service path in a ring a duplicated path for protection is reserved, which
    forces half of the overall capacity of the network to be dedicated to
    protection capacity that is rarely used.

  . Current network upgrades are difficult and expensive.   All of the SONET/SDH
    equipment operating in the same part of the network must transmit and
    receive data at the same speed. Therefore, if a service provider needs to
    increase the speed in one part of the network, the service provider must
    replace every part of the network with new, costly, higher-speed equipment
    in order for the upgrade to be effective. This process can take months of
    intense planning and deployment, slowing a service provider's ability to
    respond to substantial or unplanned increases in the demand for higher
    capacity. As each new dense wave division multiplexing channel is put into
    service, it must be permanently connected to the existing network, a time
    and labor-intensive process. As end users' data demands change and grow,
    these permanent connections limit service providers' ability to change their
    network quickly in response to service requests. Service providers therefore
    must route new services across their networks in inefficient ways, using
    more equipment and connections and creating more points of failure in order
    to achieve the desired connection.

  . Current networks are difficult to set up.   Current networks contain large
    numbers of individual pieces of equipment, each of which must be separately
    set up, connected and reconnected in response to each new customer order.
    This complex process is referred to as provisioning. These efforts require
    technicians to visit multiple locations in the network to reconnect paths
    and install hardware and software, a process that often requires hundreds of
    separate tasks. This process can take months and requires the efforts of a
    large, highly-skilled workforce equipped with specialized tools and
    knowledge.

  . SONET/SDH equipment currently requires substantial central office space and
    power.   Service providers' central office facilities are increasingly
    crowded with many types of equipment that must be connected to the network.
    In addition, deregulation has forced service providers to share their
    facilities with competitors. As a result, space for equipment

                                       44
<PAGE>

    has become scarce and expensive. SONET/SDH equipment occupies a large amount
    of space which limits capacity for network expansion. The increase in amount
    of equipment has also resulted in additional power consumption, cooling
    requirements and other related overhead costs.

  As a result of these limitations, service providers face considerable costs of
building and managing networks, which are unlikely to be recovered over an
acceptable period of time. In addition, each day of delay in service delivery is
a day of lost revenue and negatively impacts customer satisfaction. To date, the
steps that service providers have used to address these limitations have largely
been tactical and incremental, such as buying more fiber, installing new
SONET/SDH rings, increasing the speed of existing rings and employing more dense
wave division multiplexing to increase fiber capacity. Service providers are
seeking more strategic solutions that remove these limitations by upgrading the
overall network in a cost-effective manner.


Service Provider Requirements for the New Optical Network

  To overcome existing network limitations, service providers need a way to
build a new network that is designed for data traffic rather than traditional
voice traffic without disrupting current voice and data services. The network
must support the ability to deliver optical services, anywhere, at any time, for
any customer. In addition, emerging service providers need a network that allows
them to grow quickly with lower capital costs and reliable, modular equipment
that reduces their operating expenses while increasing their revenue
opportunities. Specifically, the new optical network must:

  . Rapidly provision and restore optical services.   The new network must allow
    service providers to provision and restore optical services to end users
    quickly, while significantly reducing manual labor-intensive activities.

  . Enable the development of new optical services. As competition among service
    providers increases, the new network must be flexible enough to allow
    service providers to differentiate themselves and increase revenues by
    providing their customers with new value-added services.

  . Reduce operational and maintenance costs.   The new network must have
    operational and maintenance costs that are substantially lower than the
    current network incurs with respect to personnel, space occupied, power
    consumption and cooling requirements. The new network also must limit the
    number of times personnel need to be dispatched to other locations by
    providing the capability to easily and automatically make changes in support
    of service delivery, maintenance and administration.

  . Reduce capital costs. The new network must allow service providers to reduce
    the amount of equipment required to deploy and expand the network, allowing
    service providers to reallocate capital for new services and additional
    capacity.

                                       45
<PAGE>

  . Provide for easy upgrades. The new network must be easy to upgrade in order
    to accommodate emerging technologies and enable future services. Today's
    networks are generally rigid in design, with limited ability to implement
    breakthrough technologies such as optical switching. Service providers
    typically seek a network that is upgradable without major disruption to the
    design and layout of the network. This approach extends the life of the
    products, reduces capital replacement costs and simplifies the introduction
    of new technologies.

  . Deploy proven, reliable products. Given the many pressures that service
    providers face, they do not want to risk their networks by deploying
    unproven products. They seek products that have been thoroughly tested and
    verified through previous deployments and comprehensive testing and
    evaluation.


The Tellium Solution

  We design, develop and market high-speed, high-capacity, intelligent optical
switches that enable network service providers to quickly and cost-effectively
deliver new high-speed services. Our first-generation products are field-proven,
having been in service for over two years. Our second-generation products are in
laboratory evaluation and early deployments with global service providers. These
products benefit from the experience gathered from over two years of live
service of our first-generation products. Our products are designed specifically
to manage very high-speed optical signals in the core, or center, of high-
capacity communications networks. Our products do not provide other network
functions such as combining low-speed electrical signals into higher speed
optical signals. Service providers who do not deploy high-capacity networks or
do not need high-capacity optical switching are unlikely to use our optical
switching products. We have a world-class technology team that has pioneered
many innovations in optical network engineering and has a strong heritage in the
telecommunications industry. Our optical switches provide the following key
benefits to service providers:

  . Improved network design. Our optical switches are designed to enable service
    providers to reduce their costs by deploying a network that is more
    efficient than SONET/SDH rings. In this approach, called mesh architecture,
    each network junction is connected to any number of other network junctions,
    allowing for multiple paths through the network. With this design, mesh
    networks are more efficient in their utilization of equipment, while still
    achieving the important goal of rapidly restoring service after a network
    failure. In addition, mesh networks are simpler to operate, administer and
    maintain than SONET/SDH ring networks.

  . Simplified delivery of new services. Our optical switches help service
    providers to create flexible optical networks, enabling reliable, fast,
    cost-effective delivery of new and existing optical data services. Our
    optical switches enable a new generation of data networking equipment to
    deliver data directly to the optical network and bypass costly SONET/SDH
    equipment. Service providers can combine their existing equipment with our
    optical switches to deliver data services with improved expandability,
    flexibility and survivability.

                                       46
<PAGE>

  . Fast provisioning of new services. Our optical switches are designed to
    allow service providers to provision services across their networks in a
    matter of minutes, replacing a process which can often take up to several
    months. Our advanced administration and management software allows service
    providers to provision their networks from a central management workstation
    in anticipation of changing end-user needs, eliminating the requirement to
    dispatch personnel to remote locations. As a result, re-routing traffic
    around network bottlenecks or failure points becomes easier, allowing
    service providers to offer their customers on-demand service delivery and
    fast recovery from network failures. More efficient and rapid network
    provisioning can lead to direct cost savings and revenue opportunities for
    our customers. In a highly competitive industry, our customers are able to
    differentiate themselves from their competitors by offering faster, more
    reliable services with increased flexibility.

  . Easy network expansion.   Our optical switches are designed to help service
    providers expand their networks rapidly, enabling new revenue-generating
    services that meet their customers' needs. Our products convert the optical
    network from a system requiring manual changes to a dynamic system in which
    it is easy to add or change components. Our Aurora Optical Switch, for
    example, offers the same or greater capacity than other systems on the
    market, in a physical configuration that is smaller, consumes less power and
    has a lower cost per connection.

  . Cost-effectiveness.   Our optical switches are designed to enable service
    providers to eliminate costly SONET/SDH equipment while retaining the
    features that service providers expect. Our products include modular,
    configurable hardware and software that allow our customers to retain their
    investments as they expand capacity and automate operations, while also
    significantly reducing the cost of service delivery. Our software reduces
    the amount of equipment required by operating in a mesh network. Service
    providers can install the capability to restore traffic with less capital
    equipment and less floor space, reducing both capital and ongoing costs
    while maintaining fast restoration time.

  . Compatibility with existing networks.   Our optical switches can be deployed
    quickly because they are compatible with existing networks. Our products are
    designed to support and enable mesh networks and operate with existing ring
    networks. Our equipment interoperates with a wide range of network hardware,
    such as dense wave division multiplexing systems, data network equipment,
    and all major types of SONET/SDH products. In addition, we offer
    comprehensive network management, planning and administration software that
    communicates with existing network management systems through common
    standards.

  . Flexible products.  Our optical switches are designed to be highly flexible
    and upgradable. For example, it is easy for a technician to add or remove
    components in our switches without interrupting or compromising the
    performance of the network. All of our products share a common management
    software system. A service provider can start small, using our products from
    the initial deployment through future network expansion. As our

                                       47
<PAGE>

    equipment is upgraded, there is no requirement to reprogram the connections
    between our products and other equipment and software systems in the
    network.


Strategy

  Our objective is to be a leading provider of intelligent optical switching
solutions for global public telecommunications networks. The key elements of our
strategy include the following:

  . Maximize our first mover advantage.   We were the first optical switching
    vendor to place into service a high-performance optical switch, the Aurora
    32. We are currently shipping for lab evaluations and commercial deployment
    our high-capacity second-generation switch, the Aurora Optical Switch and
    our Aurora 128, a cost-efficient, compact alternative for smaller offices.
    We intend to maintain and extend this leadership position by continuing to
    invest in research and development. We may also make acquisitions in order
    to expand our base of technology expertise, intellectual property and
    product capability.

  . Maintain a tight focus on optical switching.   We are focused on providing a
    full range of optical switches for the high-performance optical network. We
    intend to commit a substantial portion of our research and product
    development efforts toward the goal of creating an industry-leading optical
    switching product line. We believe that our focus gives us a time-to-market
    advantage over our competitors whose efforts are more broadly dispersed over
    multiple product lines.

  . Build on our heritage.   Our founders and first employees were pioneers of
    optical networking at Bellcore. Our technical staff and management team come
    from leading companies in the optical engineering and telecommunications
    equipment industries, prominent service providers and renowned academic
    institutions. We believe that this heritage provides us with a depth of
    expertise and proven operating experience that is unique in our industry. We
    will continue to build on this heritage of excellence throughout our
    engineering and management staff by aggressively recruiting top talent from
    around the world.

  . Build on our relationships with our customers.   Our management, engineering
    and sales forces have strong contacts and long-standing relationships with
    key people in the networking and optics industries, as well as in our
    customer base. We believe that our experience and relationships will enable
    us to sell additional products to our existing customers, add new customers
    and bring innovative products to market that meet our customers' needs.

  . Expand our sales force and distribution channels.   We intend to continue
    building an experienced sales force that specializes in selling optical
    switches to service providers. We will also add to our systems engineering
    force in order to help our customers implement our products. Additionally,
    we intend to expand our distribution network in order to reach a broader
    base of customers, particularly in international markets.

                                       48
<PAGE>

  . Maximize our ability to expand our operations. We outsource our
    manufacturing and purchase some key components from third parties.
    Outsourcing enables us to focus on our core competencies, including product
    development, marketing and sales and allows us to rapidly increase our
    ability to meet demand for our products.

Optical Switching Products Summary

  All of our products go through a development and customer evaluation process
before the customer begins using the product in its operations. The length of
this process will vary, depending on the product and the customer. For purposes
of the following chart, a product is described as "in development" if our
engineers currently are preparing and developing the product for eventual
customer use. A product is described as "development complete" if our engineers
have completed their work on the product, and the product is ready to be shipped
to a customer for evaluation. A product is described as "in customer evaluation"
if a customer has received the product and is evaluating the product for
compatibility with its existing systems and needs. At the customer evaluation
stage, the customer works with our engineers to correct any deficiencies and to
make any adjustments required by the customer until the product is ready to move
into the "in deployment" stage. A product is described as "in deployment" if the
customer has completed its evaluation and begun installing the product in their
network. A product is described as "in service" if the customer has begun
commercial use of the product.

  Our line of Aurora optical switches enables service providers to automate the
delivery of optical services, reduce their costs by enabling optical mesh
networking, restore optical services in the event of network failures and
redirect traffic around network bottlenecks. Our Aurora optical switches also
provide the ability to connect high-speed data networking equipment directly to
the optical network without requiring additional expensive SONET/SDH equipment.

  Our hardware and software products are standards-based and are designed to
seamlessly operate within existing optical networking equipment, protecting
service providers' prior investment in fiber optic and transmission equipment.
Our systems are modular, enabling in-service growth, from a single optical
switch channel to thousands of optical channels, in increments as small as one
channel at a time.

  Our software products, combined with our optical switches, support rapid,
automated planning, provision and restoration of the optical network using point
and click operations. This capability addresses the time-to-market requirements
that our service provider customers must meet. In addition, our products reduce
service providers' costs by delivering mesh networking and eliminating expensive
SONET/SDH equipment while still providing all of the operational features needed
to manage networks.

  Aurora 32.   The Aurora 32 is a compact optical switch designed to connect
optical paths primarily in small central offices or metropolitan networks. The
Aurora 32 is designed for service providers that desire equipment that occupies
a small amount of floor space. This system switches 32 optical channels under
software control that can carry data with speeds ranging from 155 megabits per
second up to 2.5 gigabits per second to support the rapidly changing environment
of metropolitan areas. Through simple software commands, service providers can
upgrade the speed of an optical channel without changing any hardware. The
Aurora 32 is in service and has been carrying live traffic in customer networks
since April 1999.

  Aurora Optical Switch.   The Aurora Optical Switch is designed to provide
automated service delivery and restoration of optical services in primarily
regional and national networks. Its initial capacity delivers 1.28 terabits per
second of switching bandwidth or 512 optical channels at 2.5 gigabits per
second. Each of the channels supports either SONET or SDH signals under software
control. The Aurora Optical Switch operates at optical signal speeds up to 10
gigabits per second and is designed for service providers that anticipate high
rates of growth in their network locations. The Aurora Optical Switch is
designed to grow to many times its initial capacity while the network and
product remain in service. The Aurora Optical Switch is currently being deployed
at customer sites and continues to be evaluated by other customers.

  Aurora 128.  The Aurora 128 is a compact version of the Aurora Optical Switch,
supporting all of the same features and functions.  Its capacity is 320 gigabits
per second of switching bandwidth or 128 optical channels at 2.5 gigabits per
second.  Each channel supports either SONET or SDH signals under software
control.  The Aurora 128 operates at optical signal speeds up to 10 gigabits per
second.  We announced the development of the Aurora 128 in May 2001, and it is
currently being deployed and evaluated by our customers.

  Aurora Full-Spectrum.   The Aurora Full-Spectrum is an all-optical switch
currently in development. The Aurora Full-Spectrum will feature an all-optical
switch that is being designed to switch at OC-768 and faster signal speeds. It
supports the mesh networking features and intelligence found in our other
products, while switching optical traffic at more than 40 gigabits per second.

  StarNet Operating System--Service Delivery and Restoration Software.   Our
StarNet Operating System is purchased by service providers in conjunction with
our optical switches. The StarNet Operating System software provides
communication between switches, routes optical signals around network failures
and bottlenecks, performs optical service provisioning for the mesh networks,
and supports the full range of Aurora switches. Our StarNet Operating System
software allows a single path, called the protection path, to serve as backup to
several working paths, saving much of the equipment cost of traditional ring
networks. The StarNet Operating System is currently in service.

  StarNet Wavelength Management System--Network Management Software.   Our
StarNet Wavelength Management System provides fault location, network
configuration, performance monitoring and analysis and network security. In
addition, this system provides the capability to operate, administer, maintain
and provision the entire optical switching network, not just individual network
elements. Our StarNet Wavelength Management System is currently in

                                       51

service.

  StarNet Design Tools--Software Planning and Design Tools for Optical Networks.
StarNet Design Tools allow customers to plan and design networks with optical
switches. These tools allow the user to optimize the network plan for minimum
cost and provide the user with graphical network comparisons so they can compare
SONET/SDH ring architectures with optical mesh architectures. The StarNet Design
Tools consist of two modules, the StarNet Planner and the StarNet Modeler. The
Planner is used to create and plan the optical layer of a telecommunications
network. The Modeler is used to simulate and optimize a network's performance
prior to field deployment. Both of these products work in conjunction with the
StarNet Wavelength Management System.  StarNet Design Tools are currently in
service.


Customers

  Our target customer base includes emerging and established service providers.
These include long-distance carriers and wholesale service providers, Internet
service providers and cable operators. We have been shipping our products since
January 1999, and our products have been in service and carrying live traffic
for two years. In 1999, two customers, Extant and Telcordia Technologies,
accounted for 63% and 27% of our revenues, respectively, and revenues under our
contract with Extant, which was transferred to Dynegy Connect in 2000,
represented approximately 78% and 70% of our revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and for the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.
In addition, revenues under our contract with Qwest represented approximately
18% and 30% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 and for the
three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.

  In August 2000, we entered into a five-year contract with Cable & Wireless, a
multinational provider of voice, data and network services. Under the terms of
this contract, Cable & Wireless has a minimum purchase commitment of $350
million for the worldwide deployment of our products, including the Aurora
Optical Switch, the StarNet Wavelength Management System and the StarNet
Operating System. Cable & Wireless is conducting laboratory testing of our
Aurora Optical Switch at our facilities. We expect to commence commercial
shipment under this contract during the second half of 2001. Our agreement with
Cable & Wireless gives it the right to reduce its minimum purchase commitment
from $350 million to $200 million if we do not maintain a technological edge so
that there exists in the marketplace superior technology that we have not
matched. However, if the minimum purchase commitment under our agreement is
reduced, then, at the end of the contract term, all purchases made by Cable &
Wireless, including prior purchases, will be repriced at a higher rate. Cable &
Wireless has the right to terminate the agreement if we breach our obligations
under the contract and fail to remedy the breach within 30 days, we are
prevented by forces beyond our control from performing our obligations under the
contract for more than 60 days or we persistently breach our obligations under
the contract, whether or not cured.

  In September 1999, we entered into a five-year contract with Dynegy Connect.
On September 29, 2000, Extant was acquired by Dynegy Global Communications, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Dynegy, a publicly-traded energy company. As part of
the acquisition, our contract

                                       52
<PAGE>

with Extant was transferred to Dynegy Connect, a limited partnership owned 80%
by subsidiaries of Dynegy and 20% by Telstra Corporation, an Australian
telecommunications and information services company. Dynegy is proceeding with
Extant's planned network build-out. We expect Dynegy Connect will purchase
approximately $250 million of products under the contract, although it has no
obligation to do so. However, under the terms of this contract, Dynegy Connect
is required to purchase its full requirements for optical switches from us until
November 1, 2003. Dynegy Connect has the right to terminate the agreement if,
among other things, we breach a material obligation under the contract and fail
to remedy the breach within 30 days or we violate any applicable law and so
materially impair Dynegy Connect's ability to perform its material obligations
or receive its material benefits under the contract. Our Aurora 32 optical
switch, StarNet Wavelength Management System, StarNet Design Tools and StarNet
Operating System have been in service in the Dynegy Connect network since April
2000. Dynegy Connect conducted laboratory testing of our Aurora Optical Switch
and we commenced commercial shipment under this contract during the first
quarter of 2001. In the second quarter of 2001, we commenced commercial shipment
of the Aurora 128 to Dynegy Connect. We granted to affiliates of Dynegy Connect
a warrant to purchase 5,226,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price
of $3.05 per share.

  In September 2000, we entered into an agreement with Qwest, a multinational
provider of voice, data and network services, relating to the sale of our
products. This agreement was amended in April 2001. Under the terms of the
agreement, as amended, Qwest has a minimum purchase commitment of $300 million
over the first three years of the contract and, subject to extensions under a
limited circumstance, an additional $100 million over the following two years of
the contract for the deployment of our products, including the Aurora Optical
Switch, the StarNet Wavelength Management System, the Aurora Full-Spectrum and
the StarNet Operating System. This contract expires on December 31, 2005. Qwest
began conducting laboratory testing of our Aurora Optical Switch in the fourth
quarter of 2000, and we commenced commercial shipment under this contract during
the first quarter of 2001. If we breach our obligations under the contract and
fail to remedy the breach within 30 days, Qwest, through binding arbitration,
may have the right to terminate the agreement. We granted to a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Qwest warrants to purchase 2,375,000 shares of our common stock at
an exercise price of $14.00 per share.

  We also have shipped our Aurora 32 optical switch and other custom products to
the U.S. Department of Defense as part of their high-speed optical networking
program. Shipments are completed for this contract. Our agreement with the U.S.
Department of Defense to provide maintenance expired on November 1, 2000.


Issuances to Affiliates of Customers

  In September 2000, we sold 333,333 shares of our common stock to employees and
affiliates of Qwest for $30.00 per share. In addition, we have issued options to
certain individuals who are members of our advisory board.

                                       53
<PAGE>

Advisory Board

  In the first half of 2000, we established an advisory board with members
having various expertise to provide us with advice and to consult with us on our
business, including the development of our technology and marketing of our
products and services. We believe that this advisory board provides necessary
customer and industry guidance and is critical to the success of our business.
Individuals who are employees or affiliates of current or potential customers
have joined our advisory board, including Qwest in March 2001. All members of
our advisory board were granted options to purchase our common stock. In the
future, we may add additional individuals who are employees or affiliates of
current or potential customers to our advisory board. We reimburse the members
of our advisory board for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses they incur in
connection with their services. We may in the future grant additional stock
options to our advisory board members.


Sales and Marketing

  We sell our products through a direct sales force. We have offices in London,
England and outside of Brussels, Belgium, and we intend to establish
relationships with selected distribution and marketing partners, both
domestically and internationally, in order to extend our reach and serve new
markets. As of March 31, 2001, our sales and marketing organization consisted of
41 employees, 23 of whom are located in our headquarters in Oceanport, New
Jersey and 18 of whom are located in other sales and support offices around the
United States. We intend to further expand our sales force in Europe and may
also expand our sales force into other international markets.

  Our marketing objectives include building market awareness and acceptance of
our company and our products by working very closely with our prospective
customers, industry analysts and consultants. We use our Web site as a major
communications vehicle, speak at relevant industry events and participate
actively in relevant standards organizations such as the Optical Internetworking
Forum, the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Telecommunications Management
Forum. We also conduct public relations activities, including interviews,
presentations at industry forums and investor conferences and demonstrations for
industry analysts. In addition, our senior executives and our sales people have
significant industry contacts as a result of their prior experience.


Customer Service and Support

  Our customer service team works collaboratively with our existing and
prospective customers to support their ongoing network deployments and help them
identify and create new high-speed services that they can offer to their
customers. We believe that this assistance is an integral aspect of our sales
and marketing efforts and can drive additional demand for our products. We have
assembled a nationwide team of dedicated customer engineers, and we are
expanding internationally to target new markets and support multinational
customers. As of March 31, 2001, our customer service and support organization
consisted of 52 employees.

                                       54
<PAGE>

Research and Development

  We believe that to be successful we must continue to enhance our existing
products and develop new products that meet the rapidly evolving needs of our
customers. We have made, and will continue to make, a substantial investment in
research and development. We have assembled a team of highly-skilled engineers
who have significant data communications and telecommunications industry
experience drawn from approximately 40 companies. Our engineers have expertise
in fields such as optical system design, optical network design, hardware
development and software development, including key Internet protocol routing
expertise. As of March 31, 2001, we had 280 employees and 7 full-time
contractors responsible for product research and development. We are focused on
enhancing the scalability, performance and reliability of our intelligent
optical switching products.


Intellectual Property, Proprietary Rights and Licensing

  Our intellectual property portfolio includes rights to over 30 patents and
more than 70 patents pending. Our patents and patent applications are in the
fields of optical switching, algorithms for mesh networking and optical device
technology. The remaining duration of our patents generally ranges from 10 to 17
years. Our intellectual property licenses are in the field of mesh networking
and optical switching devices and generally last for the life of the patents
unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the licenses.

  Our success and ability to compete depends on our ability to develop and
maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and product marketing and to
operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. In addition, we
must continue to create and acquire rights to intellectual property in the areas
of optical networking technology, such as mesh networking, optical switching,
switch architecture, control systems and signaling algorithms. We rely on a
combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual
restrictions to protect our intellectual property. We license our intellectual
property, including patents and software, under license agreements, which impose
restrictions on the licensee's ability to utilize the intellectual property.
Finally, we seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring
employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute
confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our proprietary
information.

  These legal protections afford only limited protection for our technology and
products. For example, others may independently develop similar or competing
technology or attempt to copy or use aspects of our products or technology that
we regard as proprietary. Furthermore, intellectual property law may not fully
protect products or technology that we consider to be our own, and claims of
intellectual property infringement may be asserted against us or against our
customers in connection with their use of our products.

  Although we have not been involved in any intellectual property litigation, we
or our customers may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our
intellectual property rights or as

                                       55
<PAGE>

a result of an allegation that we infringe the intellectual property of others.
Any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights
could force us to defend ourselves and, pursuant to the indemnification
provisions of some of our customer and supplier contracts, possibly our
customers or manufacturers against the alleged infringement. These claims and
any resulting lawsuit, if successful, could subject us to significant liability
for damages and weaken the extent of, or lose the protection offered by, our
proprietary rights. These lawsuits, regardless of their success, would likely be
time-consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert our management's time
and attention. This litigation could also compel us to do one or more of the
following:

  . stop selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged
    intellectual property;

  . obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license
    to make, use or sell the relevant technology, which license may not be
    available on reasonable terms, or at all;

  . redesign those products that use the technology; and

  . pay monetary damages for past infringement of third-party intellectual
    property rights.

  We also currently license intellectual property from third parties, some of
which may subject us to royalty payments. The intellectual property associated
with optical networking products is evolving rapidly, so protection under a
license that was once adequate may be insufficient in the future. We may be
required to license additional intellectual property from third parties to
develop new products or enhance our existing products. These additional third-
party licenses may not be, and our existing third-party licenses may not
continue to be, available to us on commercially-reasonable terms.

  Given the rapid technological changes in this industry, establishing and
maintaining a technology leadership position through the technological and
creative skills of our personnel, new product developments and enhancements to
existing products will be very important to us.


Competition

  Competition in the market for public network infrastructure is intense. Our
competitors include Alcatel, CIENA Corporation, Lucent Technologies Inc., Nortel
Networks Corporation, Sycamore Networks, Inc. and Tellabs, Inc. and several new
companies such as Calient Networks, Inc. and Brightlink Networks. The market for
optical switching is expected to grow rapidly and therefore will continue to
attract competitors who will continue to introduce new products. Therefore, we
expect the level of competition to intensify over time. Our established
competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger
customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and
manufacturing resources, including more resources devoted to research and
development of new products, than we do. In addition, unlike some of our
competitors, we have only a limited ability to provide vendor-sponsored
financing, which

                                       56
<PAGE>

may influence the purchasing decision of prospective customers. Our competitors
could develop new technologies that compete with our products or even render our
products obsolete. In addition, some of our competitors have more significant
customer relationships and broader product lines than we have.

  Our objective is to become a leading provider of intelligent optical switches
for global telecommunications networks. We believe that we have achieved a
number of milestones that will position us to meet this objective. For example,
we were the first in our industry to ship an optical switch to a customer and
the first in our industry to ship a high capacity, expandable 512-port switch to
a customer. In addition, we were the provider of the first optical switch to
carry commercial traffic in a customer's network. We have also entered into
minimum purchase contracts with two well-known service providers, Cable &
Wireless and Qwest.

  For us to continue to compete successfully in this market, we must continue to
deliver optical switches that:

  . can be easily expanded at low cost to meet the ever-increasing demands
    driven by data services;

  . lower a service provider's cost of building and operating an optical network
    by reducing its complexity and increasing its flexibility;

  . deliver a range of cost-effective solutions for small and large networks;

  . operate with existing equipment and networks;

  . comply with all applicable standards;

  . increase the level of network reliability for data services;

  . allow optical services to be delivered much more quickly and easily than
    they are today; and

  . provide software tools for service providers to plan, design and operate
    their optical networks.


Manufacturing

  We outsource almost all of the manufacturing of our products. We design,
specify and monitor all of the tests that are required to meet our internal and
external quality standards.

  In August 2000, we signed a contract with Solectron Corporation, a leading
contract manufacturer of high-quality, technology-based equipment, to
manufacture printed circuit boards. Solectron will provide comprehensive
manufacturing services, including assembly, test, control and shipment to our
customers and procure materials on our behalf. Under our contract

                                       57
<PAGE>

with Solectron, we have the option to move final assembly and test functions to
Solectron.

  We are currently negotiating with another vendor for chassis assembly and are
also negotiating with several other vendors and distributors to establish
relationships that will support our future growth. In addition, we are investing
in automation, testing and data collection equipment to enable us to further
improve product quality as quickly as possible.

  We believe that our relationship with Solectron and the continued outsourcing
of our manufacturing will enable us to:

  . expand our access to key components;

  . conserve the working capital that would be required to purchase inventory or
    develop manufacturing facilities of our own; and

  . better adjust manufacturing volumes to meet changes in demand.

  We currently purchase products through purchase orders. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to continue this arrangement on a long-term basis on terms
acceptable to us, if at all.

  In December 2000, we received ISO 9001 certification in conformance with
quality standards set by the International Organization for Standardization.


Employees

  As of March 31, 2001, we had 493 employees, of which:

  . 280 were in research and development;

  . 93 were in sales and marketing, customer service and support;

  . 73 were in manufacturing, quality assurance and documentation; and

  . 47 were in finance and administration.

  We believe our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees is
covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Generally, our employees are
retained on an at-will basis. All of our employees are required to sign
confidentiality, non-competition and intellectual property agreements.


Properties

  Our headquarters are located in Oceanport, New Jersey and consist of
approximately 72,000 square feet of leased space, the lease for which expires in
June 2005. We also have a major

                                       58
<PAGE>

facility across the street from our Oceanport headquarters in West Long Branch,
New Jersey, which consists of approximately 68,000 square feet of manufacturing
and training space and 25,000 square feet of office space. The lease for the
manufacturing and training space expires in November 2006. The lease for the
office space expires in October 2005.

Board of Directors

board of directors are divided into three classes: Class I, whose term will
expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2002, consists of
Messrs. Roper and Smith; Class II, whose term will expire at the annual meeting
of stockholders to be held in 2003, consists of Messrs. Bunting and Glassmeyer;
and Class III, whose term will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to

meeting of stockholders after the initial classification, the successors to
directors whose terms will then expire will be elected to serve from the time of
election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election.
This classification of the board of directors may have the effect of delaying or
preventing a change of control or management of our company. Each officer serves
at the discretion of the board of directors. There are no family relationships
between any of our directors or officers.

  Our board of directors determines the amount of any fees, whether payable in
cash, shares of common stock or options to purchase common stock, and expense
reimbursements that directors receive for attending meetings of the board of
directors or committees of the board. To date, we have not paid any fees to our
directors, but have reimbursed them for their reasonable expenses in attending
board and board committee meetings. We have granted options to our directors in
the past as set forth below. Under our 2001 stock incentive plan, each new non-
employee director receives an automatic grant of 5,000 options upon initially
becoming a director, and an annual automatic grant of 1,500 options in January
of each year that the 2001 stock incentive plan is in effect if he or she
continues to serve as a non-employee director on that date.

  As of October 18, 2000, we granted options to purchase shares of our common
stock at an exercise price of $3.10 per share to the following directors:

/(1)/ Potential realizable values are computed by (i) multiplying the number of
      shares of common stock subject to a given option by the initial public
      offering price of our common stock of $15.00, (ii) assuming that the
      aggregate stock value derived from that calculation compounds at the
      annual 0%, 5% or 10% rates shown in the table over the term of the
      options, and (iii) subtracting from that result the aggregate option
      exercise price. The potential realizable values set forth above do not
      take into account applicable tax expense payments that may be associated
      with such option exercises. Actual realizable value, if any, will be
      dependent on the future price of the common stock on the actual date of
      exercise, which may be earlier than the stated expiration date.

the executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table as of December

the exercise price of the options.  There was no public trading market for the
common stock as of December 31, 2000.  Accordingly, the values set forth below
were calculated based on $15.00 per share, which was the initial public offering
price of our common stock, less the exercise price per share, multiplied by the
number of shares underlying the options.

the Board and Chief Executive Officer beginning in January 2000 for a period of
two years or until he resigns, is disabled, dies or is terminated by us for any

we or Mr. Carr give notice of intent not to renew at least 90 days before the
end of an employment term.

  Mr. Carr began to receive an annual base salary of $300,000 in January 2000,
subject to increases as determined by our board of directors based upon Mr.

granted options to purchase 6,600,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Carr at
an exercise price of $2.14 per share, which Mr. Carr exercised on April 4, 2000.
Mr. Carr is eligible to receive a bonus of up to 66-2/3% of his base salary each
year during the term of employment in which we and Mr. Carr achieve objectives
mutually agreed upon by Mr. Carr and our board of directors for such fiscal
year. If Mr. Carr exceeds the agreed upon objectives, the board of directors may
provide for an additional bonus. The agreement also provides for benefits, the
reimbursement of expenses and the payment of the rental costs of Mr. Carr's
residence near our offices.

  The employment agreement also prohibits Mr. Carr, during his employment with
us and for

                                       66

one year after his employment ends, from soliciting any of our employees, or
interfering with any of our business relationships. The agreement also requires
that Mr. Carr protect Tellium's trade secrets and confidential information
during his employment with us, and for one year after his employment ends.

  Pursuant to the employment agreement, if we terminate Mr. Carr's employment
for any reason or if Mr. Carr exercises his right to terminate the agreement
within six months of the occurrence of any of the following:

  . an adverse change in Mr. Carr's title, position, duties, powers and
    authority, reporting relationship or the scope of his responsibilities,

  . the occurrence of a change of control,

  . a failure by our successor to assume Mr. Carr's employment agreement in a
    situation other than a change in control, or

  . a material breach of the employment agreement that remains uncured for 14
    days following our receipt of notice of the breach,

Mr. Carr is entitled to receive, among other things, his annual base salary for
one year paid ratably over this period, any unpaid bonuses earned prior to
termination, any unpaid benefits under group health and life insurance plans for
one year after termination, any unpaid benefits under employee benefit plans and
any reimbursable expenses.

  According to the employment agreement, if Mr. Carr dies or becomes disabled,
he is entitled to receive all of the amounts described above, except that he
will only be entitled to receive his then-current salary through the last day of
the month he died or became disabled and any unpaid bonus for that portion of
the year that the death or disability occurred.

  Mr. Carr may also terminate the employment agreement at any time upon 30 days
written notice. In that event, he will be entitled to receive his salary as of
the date of termination, any unpaid bonus earned with respect to prior years,
any unpaid benefits under group health and life insurance plans or employee
benefit plans and any reimbursable expenses.

  The employment agreement also provides that if Mr. Carr receives a payment or
benefit upon a change of control that is subject to an excise or similar-purpose
tax, we will pay Mr. Carr such additional compensation as is necessary to place
him in the same after-tax position he would have been in had no such taxes been
paid or incurred.

Restricted Stock Agreements

  Harry J. Carr.   On December 21, 1999, we granted stock options to Mr. Carr to
purchase an aggregate of 6,600,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise
price of $2.14 per share. On April 4, 2000, Mr. Carr exercised these stock
options in full and received 6,600,000 shares of our common stock, which are
subject to two restricted stock agreements. In connection with the stock
purchases, Mr. Carr delivered two promissory notes to us in the aggregate amount
of $14,099,800, less the par value of the stock purchased, which was paid in
cash. Each promissory note is secured by a pledge of purchased stock held by Mr.
Carr and various transferees. Mr. Carr is obligated to repay his loans, plus a
fixed rate of 7.5% per annum on the outstanding principle balance:

  . upon the occurrence of a liquidity event (with respect to the portion of the
    principal attributable to the shares of restricted stock that are sold); or

  . on the termination date of each of Mr. Carr's restricted stock agreements.

  Mr. Carr purchased 6,000,000 shares of our common stock under a restricted
stock agreement dated April 4, 2000. Under the terms of this agreement,
3,000,000 shares vested as of January 2, 2000. Of the remaining 3,000,000
shares, 750,000 vested on December 21, 2000 and 2,250,000 will vest ratably on a
monthly basis over the succeeding three years. Mr. Carr also purchased 600,000
shares of our common stock under a second restricted stock agreement dated April
4, 2000. These shares vested under the terms of this agreement in November 2000.

                                       68
<PAGE>

  The restricted stock agreement provides that Mr. Carr may only transfer his
unvested shares to us or by will or laws of descent and distribution, under a
domestic relations order, by gift to members of his family, to trusts solely for
the benefit of his family members, to persons with whom he has had a significant
pre-existing business or personal relationship, to entities in which such family
members, friends and/or trusts are the only partners and to charitable
organizations.

  Under the terms of the restricted stock agreement, we have the right to
repurchase any unvested shares of restricted stock, at a per share price equal
to the exercise price per share paid by Mr. Carr, plus accrued interest, if Mr.
Carr voluntarily terminates his employment with us. Our repurchase right is
exercisable only during the one-year period following such termination.

  The restricted stock agreement also provides that all of the unvested shares
will immediately vest, and Tellium's right of repurchase shall lapse, upon the
occurrence of any of the following:

  . the sale or acquisition of beneficial ownership of our equity securities
    constituting 50% or more of the total voting power of our stockholders by a
    party or group of related parties (other than us or a person that directly
    or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
    us);

  . a merger or consolidation of Tellium with or into another entity and the
    holders of our equity securities prior to such transaction possess less than
    50% of the total voting power of the surviving company after such
    transaction;

  . a complete liquidation or dissolution of Tellium;

  . a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; or

  . a change in the composition of our board of directors over a 36-month period
    such that a majority of the board is no longer comprised of persons who
    either have been board members continuously since the beginning of such
    period or have been elected or nominated for election as board members
    during such period by at least a majority of the persons who have been board
    members over that same period.

If, as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of the then-unvested shares
due to a corporate transaction as described above, Mr. Carr is required to pay
an excise tax with respect to the accelerated shares, then Mr. Carr is entitled
to receive an additional payment from us in an amount as is necessary to place
him in the same after-tax position he would have been in had no such excise
taxes been paid or incurred.

  Other Restricted Stock Agreements.   We have also entered into restricted
stock agreements with each of Messrs. Bala, Barcus, and Losch, as well as
several of our other employees. In connection with these restricted stock
agreements, each executive delivered a promissory note to us for the full amount
of the purchase price, less the par value of the stock purchased. The loans are
for the following amounts:

  Total.............................................   $6,515,620


  The promissory notes are secured by pledges of purchased stock held by the
executives and various transferees. Each executive is obligated to repay his or
her loans, plus a fixed rate of interest of 7.5% per annum on the outstanding
principal balance:

  . upon the occurrence of a liquidity event (with respect to the portion of the
    principal attributable to the shares of restricted stock that are sold); or

  . on the termination date of each such executive's restricted stock agreement.

  Each restricted stock agreement also contains restrictions on the transfer of
shares, except to permitted transferees, such as to his or her executors or
beneficiaries upon death, to his or her spouse and persons with whom he or she
has had a significant pre-existing business or personal relationship.

  Each restricted stock agreement provides us the right to repurchase any of the
executive's unvested shares at a per share price equal to the exercise price per
share paid by the executive, plus accrued interest, during the one-year period
after the executive's employment with us is terminated for any reason, with or
without cause.

  Our right to repurchase the executive's unvested shares will lapse with
respect to, and the executive, if he or she is then employed with us, shall
acquire a vested interest in, 50% of the then-unvested shares if any of the
following corporate transactions occur:

  . the sale or acquisition of beneficial ownership of our equity securities
    constituting 50% or more of the total voting power of our stockholders by a
    party or group of related parties (other than us or a person that directly
    or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
    us);

  . a merger or consolidation of Tellium with or into another entity and the
    holders of our equity securities prior to such transaction possess less than
    50% of the total voting power of the surviving company after such
    transaction;

  . a complete liquidation or dissolution of Tellium;

  . a sale of all or substantially all of our assets; or

  . a change in the composition of our board of directors over a 36-month period
    such that a majority of the board is no longer comprised of persons who
    either have been board members continuously since the beginning of such
    period or have been elected or

                                       70
<PAGE>

    nominated for election as board members during such period by at least a
    majority of the persons who have been board members over that same period.

If, as a result of the transactions described above, the executive is required
to pay an excise tax with respect to the shares that vested as a result of such
transactions, the executive is entitled to receive an additional payment from us
in an amount as is necessary to place him or her in the same after-tax position
he or she would have been in had no such excise taxes been paid or incurred.

  Our right to repurchase will lapse with respect to, and the executive, if he
or she is then employed with us, shall acquire a vested interest in, the
remaining 50% of the executive's unvested shares if:

  . there is a meaningful alteration that is adverse to the executive in the
    nature or status of his or her responsibilities or in his or her position
    with us from those in effect immediately prior to a corporate transaction
    described above;

  . a requirement by us, after a corporate transaction, that the executive
    perform his or her responsibilities for us at a location that is more than
    60 miles from the location of the executive's employment at the time of such
    transaction; or

  . we breach a material term of such executive's restricted stock agreement and
    fail to cure within 30 days after notice from the executive of such breach.

  Under the terms of each restricted stock agreement, we have the right to
repurchase any or all of the executive's vested shares of restricted stock at a
per share price equal to the fair market value if:

  . the executive's employment with us is or could be terminated by us for
    cause; or

  . the executive attempts to transfer any vested shares other than as permitted
    under the executive's restricted stock agreement.

  Under the terms of the restricted stock agreements, the shares will vest,
unless vested earlier, according to the following schedule:

  . 25% of the shares will vest on the first anniversary of the date set forth
    in the restricted stock agreements as the vesting measurement date, if the
    executive is then employed by us;

  . 1/36th of the remaining shares will vest on the last day of each calendar
    month commencing with the thirteenth month anniversary of the vesting
    measurement date and ending on the 48th month anniversary of the vesting
    measurement date, if, on each monthly vesting date, the executive is then
    employed by us.

Registration Rights

                                       71
<PAGE>

  On September 19, 2000, we entered into an amended stockholders' agreement with
holders of our preferred stock and some of our other stockholders.  This
agreement provides that after November 19, 2001, one or more of these
stockholders has the right to:

  . demand that we file up to two registration statements to register all or
part of their shares of common stock if the anticipated offering price subject
to the registration request equals or exceeds $20.0 million;

  . demand once annually that we file a Form S-3 registration statement if we
qualify to use that form and if the anticipated offering price of the securities
expected to be registered exceeds $1.0 million; and

  . include all or part of their shares of common stock on other registration
statements that we file.

Thomas Weisel Capital Partners LLC and its affiliates and transferees also have
the right to demand that we file one registration statement to register all or
part of their shares of common stock.

  None of our stockholders has the right to demand that we register any of their
shares within six months of the effective date of a registration statement we
file under the Securities Act of 1933.  All of these registration rights are
subject to further conditions and limitations, among them our right or the right
of the underwriters of an offering to limit the number of shares included in a
registration under some circumstances.

  Parties to the amended stockholders' agreement include, among others, the
following persons who own of record or beneficially more than 5% of our
securities:

  . SAIC;

  . entities affiliated with Oak Investment Partners;

  . entities affiliated with Thomas Weisel Capital Partners LLC; and

  . Lucent Technologies, Inc.

Board Approval of Related-Party Transactions

  We intend to have the terms of all future related-party transactions be no
less favorable to us than terms that could be obtained from unaffiliated third
parties, and to have all future related-party transactions approved by a
majority of our board of directors.

                             PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS


  The following table sets forth, as of June 30, 2001, information with respect
to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by:

  . each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of the outstanding
    shares of our common stock;

  . each director of Tellium and each executive officer named in the Summary
    Compensation Table; and

  . all directors and executive officers as a group.

  Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and includes voting or investment power with
respect to the securities. Common stock subject to options or warrants that are
currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of June 30, 2001 are deemed
to be outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding such options or
warrants. Such shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purposes of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Percentage of beneficial
ownership is based on 110,871,024 shares of common stock outstanding as of June
30, 2001.

  Unless otherwise indicated, each stockholder has sole voting and investment
power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by the stockholder and has
the same address as Tellium. Our address is 2 Crescent Place, Oceanport, New
Jersey 07757-0901.

                              SELLING STOCKHOLDERS

   The table below lists each selling stockholder and (1) the amount of common
stock owned by each selling stockholder before the offering and (2) the amount
to be offered for the selling stockholder's account.  This prospectus relates to
a total of 21,633,336 shares of common stock, 2,375,000 of which are not
currently outstanding but may be acquired by one of the selling stockholders
upon exercise of outstanding warrants.  Selling stockholders who own in the
aggregate less than 1% of our outstanding common stock have not been named
individually.

   The selling stockholders will determine the actual number of shares, if any,
that they will sell.  Because the selling stockholders may sell all, some or
none of the shares of common stock that they hold, we are unable to estimate the
amount or percentage of shares of common stock that they will hold after
completion of the offering.

   We are registering the shares for resale by the selling stockholders in
accordance with their registration rights. Under a registration rights agreement
with some of the selling stockholders, we have agreed to use our reasonable best
efforts to have this registration statement declared effective by August 20,
2001. On August 15, 2001, lockups will expire with respect to 14,698,717 of the
21,633,336 shares covered by this registration statement, and those shares will
become freely saleable under this registration statement once it is declared
effective. None of those shares can be resold, under this registration statement
or otherwise, before August 15, 2001. An additional 4,316,883 shares covered by
this registration statement are subject to lockup agreements that will expire on
November 13, 2001, and are not freely saleable until that time. 2,375,000 shares
covered by this registration statement are subject to warrants with restrictions
on exercisability.

     The 21,633,336 shares covered by this registration statement include
14,356,836 shares owned by former holders of our Series E preferred stock. The
Series E preferred stock was issued as part of a private financing principally
to institutional investors in September 2000. These shares were automatically
converted into common stock upon the consummation of our initial public
offering.

                              PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

          The selling stockholders, or their pledgees, donees, transferees, or
any of their successors in interest selling shares received from a named selling
stockholder as a gift, partnership distribution or

                                       81
<PAGE>

other non-sale-related transfer after the date of this prospectus (all of whom
may be selling stockholders), may sell the securities from time to time on any
stock exchange or automated interdealer quotation system on which the securities
are listed, at prices and on terms then prevailing at the time of sale, at
prices related to the then-current market price, at fixed prices or in privately
negotiated transactions or otherwise. The selling stockholders will act
independently of us in making decisions with respect to the timing, manner and
size of each sale. The selling stockholders may sell the securities by one or
more of the following methods, without limitation:

     (a)  block trades in which the broker or dealer so engaged will attempt to
          sell the securities as agent but may position and resell a portion of
          the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;

     (b)  purchases by a broker or dealer as principal and resale by the broker
          or dealer for its own account under this prospectus;

     (c)  an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of any stock
          exchange on which the securities are listed;

     (d)  ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker
          solicits purchases;

     (e)  privately negotiated transactions;

     (f)  short sales;

     (g)  through the writing of options on the securities, whether or not the
          options are listed on an options exchange;

     (h)  through the distribution of the securities by any selling stockholder
          to its partners, members or stockholders;

     (i)  one or more underwritten offerings on a firm commitment or best
          efforts basis;

     (j)  agreements by the broker-dealer and the selling stockholders to sell a
          specified number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;

     (k)  any combination of any of these methods of sale; and

     (l)  any other method permitted by applicable law.

     The selling stockholders may also transfer the securities by gift. The
selling stockholders have advised us that they have not entered into any
agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriters, broker-
dealers, or financial institutions regarding the sale of their shares other than
ordinary course brokerage arrangements, nor is there an underwriter or
coordinating broker acting in connection with the proposed sale of shares by the
selling stockholders.

                                       82
<PAGE>

     The selling stockholders may engage brokers and dealers, and any brokers or
dealers may arrange for other brokers or dealers to participate in effecting
sales of the securities. These brokers, dealers or underwriters may act as
principals, or as an agent of a selling stockholder. Broker-dealers may agree
with a selling stockholder to sell a specified number of the securities at a
stipulated price per security. If the broker-dealer is unable to sell securities
acting as agent for a selling stockholder, it may purchase as principal any
unsold securities at the stipulated price. Broker-dealers who acquire securities
as principals may thereafter resell the securities from time to time in
transactions in any stock exchange or automated interdealer quotation system on
which the securities are then listed, at prices and on terms then prevailing at
the time of sale, at prices related to the then-current market price, at fixed
prices or in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Broker-dealers may
use block transactions and sales to and through broker-dealers, including
transactions of the nature described above. The selling stockholders may also
sell the securities in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act of
1933, if available, or under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, rather than
under to this prospectus, regardless of whether the securities are covered by
this prospectus.

     From time to time, one or more of the selling stockholders may pledge,
hypothecate or grant a security interest in some or all of the securities owned
by them. The pledgees, secured parties or person to whom the securities have
been hypothecated will, upon foreclosure in the event of default, be deemed to
be selling stockholders. The number of a selling stockholder's securities
offered under this prospectus will decrease as and when it takes such actions.
The plan of distribution for that selling stockholder's securities will
otherwise remain unchanged.

     To the extent required under the Securities Act, the aggregate amount of
selling stockholders' securities being offered and the terms of the offering,
the names of any agents, brokers dealers or underwriters and any applicable
commission with respect to a particular offer will be set forth in an
accompanying prospectus supplement. Any underwriters, dealers, brokers or agents
participating in the distribution of the securities may receive compensation in
the form of underwriting discounts, concessions, commissions or fees from a
selling stockholder and/or purchasers of selling stockholders' securities, for
whom they may act (which compensation as to a particular broker- dealer might be
in excess of customary commissions).

     The selling stockholders and any underwriters, brokers, dealers or agents
that participate in the distribution of the securities may be deemed to be
"underwriters" within the meaning of the Securities Act, and any discounts,
concessions, commissions or fees received by them and any profit on the resale
of the securities sold by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and
commissions.

     Unless otherwise prohibited, the selling stockholders may enter into
hedging transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions in
connection with distributions of the shares or otherwise. In such transactions,
broker-dealers or financial institutions may engage in short sales of the shares
in the course of hedging the position they assume with the selling stockholders.
The selling stockholders may also engage in short sales, puts and calls,
forward-exchange contracts, collars and other transactions in our securities or
derivatives of our securities and may sell or deliver shares in connection with
these trades. If the selling stockholders sell shares short, they may redeliver
the shares to close out such short positions. The selling stockholders may

                                       83
<PAGE>

also enter into option or other transactions with broker-dealers or financial
institutions which require the delivery to the broker-dealer or the financial
institution of the shares. The broker-dealer or financial institution may then
resell or otherwise transfer such shares under this prospectus. In addition, the
selling stockholders may loan their shares to broker-dealers or financial
institutions who are counterparties to hedging transactions and the broker-
dealers, financial institutions or counterparties may sell the borrowed shares
into the public market. The selling stockholders may also pledge their shares to
their brokers or financial institutions and under the margin loan the broker or
financial institution may, from time to time, offer and sell the pledged shares.

     The selling stockholders and other persons participating in the sale or
distribution of the securities will be subject to applicable provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder,
including Regulation M. This regulation may limit the timing of purchases and
sales of any the securities by the selling stockholders and any other person.
The anti-manipulation rules under the Exchange Act may apply to sales of
securities in the market and to the activities of the selling stockholders and
their affiliates. Furthermore, Regulation M may restrict the ability of any
person engaged in the distribution of the securities to engage in market-making
activities with respect to the particular securities being distributed for a
period of up to five business days before the distribution. These restrictions
may affect the marketability of the securities and the ability of any person or
entity to engage in market-making activities with respect to the securities.

     We have agreed to indemnify each selling stockholder and its officers,
directors and agents and each person who controls such selling stockholder
within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against certain
liabilities arising under the federal securities laws. The selling stockholders
have also agreed to indemnify us against certain liabilities arising under the
federal securities laws.

     The shares will be sold only through registered or licensed brokers or
dealers if required under applicable state securities laws. In addition, in
certain states the shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or
qualified for sale in the applicable state or an exemption from the registration
or qualification requirement is available and complied with.

     We will file a supplement to this prospectus, if required, under Rule
424(b) under the Securities Act upon being notified by a selling stockholder
that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer or
financial institution for the sale of shares through a block trade, special or
underwritten offering, exchange distribution or secondary distribution or a
purchase by a broker, dealer or financial institution. Such supplement will
disclose:

     .    the name of each selling stockholder and of the participating broker-
          dealer(s) or financial institution(s);

     .    the number of shares involved;

     .    the price at which such shares were sold;

                                       84
<PAGE>

     .    the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such
          broker- dealer(s) or financial institution(s), where applicable;

     .    that such broker-dealer(s) or financial institution(s) did not conduct
          any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by
          reference in this prospectus; and

     .    other facts material to the transaction.

     In addition, upon being notified by a selling stockholder that a donee or
pledgee intends to sell more than 500 shares, we will file a supplement to this
prospectus.

     The securities offered hereby were originally issued to the selling
stockholders under an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. We agreed to register these securities under the Securities Act,
and to keep the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part
effective until the earlier of the date on which specified selling stockholders
have sold all of the securities or two years after the effective date of the
registration statement. We have agreed to pay the expenses in connection with
the registration of the shares offered in this prospectus. We have also agreed
to pay the legal fees and expenses of one counsel acting on behalf of some of
the selling stockholders. Any commissions, fees, taxes or other amounts in
connection with any sale of the shares will be borne by the selling
stockholders. The selling stockholders may agree to indemnify any broker-dealer
or agent that participates in transactions involving sales of the shares against
certain liabilities in connection with the offering of the shares arising under
the Securities Act.

                          DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK


General

  As of June 30, 2001, our authorized capital stock consisted of 900,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of which 110,871,024 were
issued and outstanding, and 25,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock,
par value $.001 per share, issuable in one or more series designated by our
board of directors, of which no shares were issued and outstanding.  As of June
30, 2001, 25,916,695 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of stock options previously granted under our stock incentive plans,
and  approximately 4,815,704 shares of common stock were available for future
issuance under our current stock incentive plan.  As of June 30, 2001, there
were approximately 527 holders of record of our common stock.


Common Stock

  Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and do not have cumulative voting
rights. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors
standing for election. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive
proportionately any such dividends declared by the board of directors, subject
to any preferential dividend rights of outstanding preferred stock. Upon the
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Tellium, the holders of common stock
are entitled to receive ratably our net assets available after the payment of
all debts and other liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any
outstanding preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive,
subscription, redemption or conversion rights. The rights, preferences and
privileges of holders of common stock are subject to the rights of the holders
of any series of preferred stock which we may designate and issue in the future.
A significant percentage of the holders of our common stock have the right to
require us to register their shares of common stock under the Securities Act in
specified circumstances.


Preferred Stock

  Under the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our
board of directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or
more series without stockholder approval. The board has discretion to determine
the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting rights,
dividend rights, conversion rights, redemption privileges and liquidation
preferences of each series of preferred stock. The purpose of authorizing the
board of directors to issue preferred stock and determine its rights and
preferences is to eliminate delays associated with a stockholder vote on
specific issuances. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing desirable
flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate
purposes, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could
discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting
stock.

Warrants

  Affiliates of Dynegy Connect hold a warrant to purchase 5,226,000 shares of
our common stock at an exercise price of $3.05 per share. The purchase rights
represented by the warrant were initially subject to a vesting schedule based on
purchase milestones set forth in the Dynegy Connect equipment purchase
agreement. As of November 2, 2000, we amended the warrant agreement to
immediately vest all of the remaining shares subject to the warrant. The revised
agreement provides that the warrant becomes exercisable based on the schedule of
milestones previously contained in the warrant. If the milestones are not
reached by March 31, 2005, the remaining unexercised shares subject to the
warrant will then become exercisable.

  On November 11, 1999, we issued two warrants to purchase an aggregate of
29,509 shares of our Series C preferred stock to Comdisco, Inc., at a purchase
price of $9.15 per share, as consideration for a lease line of credit. Under the
terms of each of these warrants, Comdisco also has the right to purchase
additional shares of our Series C preferred stock if the total cost of equipment
we lease from Comdisco exceeds specified amounts. The warrant is exercisable at
any time and expires on the earlier of five years after our initial public
offering or ten years from the date the warrant was issued.

  As part of our agreement with Qwest, we issued three warrants to a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Qwest to purchase 2,375,000 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $14.00 per share. The 2,375,000 shares subject to the warrants
were vested when we issued the warrants. One of the warrants is exercisable as
to 1,000,000 shares. Another warrant becomes exercisable as to 1,000,000 shares
at the earlier of Qwest meeting specified milestones during the term of our
procurement contract or on September 18, 2005, which is five years from the date
of the warrant. The third warrant becomes exercisable as to the remaining
375,000 shares at the earlier of Qwest meeting a milestone during the term of
our procurement contract or on April 10, 2007, which is six years from the date
of the warrant. The first warrant expires September 18, 2005, the second warrant
expires the later of six months after the last day the warrant becomes
exercisable or September 18, 2005, and the third warrant expires the later of
six months after the last day the warrant becomes exercisable or April 10, 2007.


Delaware Law And Certain Charter And Bylaw Provisions; Anti-Takeover Effects

  We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law
of Delaware. In general, the statute prohibits a publicly held Delaware
corporation from engaging in a "business combination" with an "interested
stockholder" for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in
which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business
combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A "business combination"
includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial
benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to exceptions, an "interested
stockholder" is a person who, together with his affiliates and associates, owns,
or within three years did own, 15% or more of the corporation's voting stock.
The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws

                                       87
<PAGE>

provide that:

     .    the board of directors be divided into three classes, as nearly equal
          in size as possible, with staggered three-year terms;

     .    directors may be removed only for cause by the affirmative vote of the
          holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to
          vote; and

     .    any vacancy on the board of directors, however the vacancy occurs,
          including a vacancy due to an enlargement of the board, may only be
          filled by vote of the directors then in office.

     The classification of the board of directors and the limitations on removal
of directors and filling of vacancies could have the effect of making it more
difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from
acquiring, us.

     The amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and
restated bylaws also provide that:

     .    any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders at an
          annual meeting or special meeting of stockholders may only be taken if
          it is properly brought before such meeting and may not be taken by
          written action in lieu of a meeting; and

     .    special meetings of the stockholders may only be called by the board
          of directors.

     Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, in order for any matter to be
considered "properly brought" before a meeting, a stockholder must comply with
requirements regarding advance notice to us. These provisions could delay until
the next stockholders' meeting stockholder actions which are favored by the
holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities. These provisions may
also discourage another person or entity from making a tender offer for our
common stock, because such person or entity, even if it acquired a majority of
our outstanding voting securities, would be able to take action as a stockholder
(such as electing new directors or approving a merger) only at a duly called
stockholders meeting, and not by written consent.

     Delaware's corporation law provides generally that the affirmative vote of
a majority of the shares entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a
corporation's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless a corporation's
certificate of incorporation or bylaws requires a greater percentage. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors
to amend or repeal our bylaws by majority vote but requires the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of the shares of our capital stock entitled
to vote to amend or repeal any of the provisions of our amended and restated
bylaws. Generally our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be
amended by holders of a majority of the shares of our capital stock issued and
outstanding and entitled to vote. The stockholder vote with respect to our
certificate of incorporation or bylaws would be in addition to any separate
class vote that might in the future be required under the terms of any series
preferred stock that might be outstanding

at the time any such amendments are submitted to stockholders.


Limitation of Liability and Indemnification

     Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our
directors and officers shall be indemnified by us to the fullest extent
authorized by Delaware law. This indemnification would cover all expenses and
liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with their services for or on
behalf of us. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages
to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, unless they violated
their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly
or intentionally violated the law, authorized illegal dividends or redemptions
or derived an improper personal benefit from their action as directors.

     Delaware law also provides that indemnification permitted under the law
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the directors and
officers may be entitled under the corporation's bylaws, any agreement, a vote
of stockholders or otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation provides that we shall fully indemnify any person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to any actual or threatened action,
suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by
reason of the fact that such person is or was one of our directors or officers
or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including
attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or
proceeding.

     Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation permits us to secure
insurance on behalf of any officer or director for any liability arising out of
his or her actions, regardless of whether the Delaware General Corporation Law
would permit indemnification. We have obtained liability insurance for our
officers and directors.

     At present, we are not the subject of any pending litigation or proceeding
involving any director, officer, employee or agent as to which indemnification
will be required or permitted under our certificate of incorporation. We are not
aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for
such indemnification.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Tellium, Inc.

  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tellium, Inc.
(the "Company") as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity (deficiency) and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

  We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 1999 and 2000, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

                         REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Tellium, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of operations, changes in
stockholders' equity (deficiency) and cash flows of Tellium, Inc. for the year
ended December 31, 1998. Our audit also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 16 for the year ended December 31, 1998.
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

Since the date of completion of our audit of the accompanying 1998 financial
statements and initial issuance of our report thereon dated August 22, 1999,
which report contained an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's ability
to continue as a going concern, the Company, as discussed in Notes 7 and 8, has
completed two private placements of its preferred stock resulting in net
proceeds of approximately $268 million and has entered into a $10 million line
of credit with a bank. Therefore, the conditions that raised substantial doubt
about whether the Company will continue as a going concern no longer exist.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the results of operations of Tellium, Inc. and its cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the
related financial statement schedule for the year ended December 31, 1998, when
considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole,
presents fairly, in all material respects the financial information set forth
herein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
             FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998, 1999, AND 2000
           AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2000 (UNAUDITED)
                              AND 2001 (UNAUDITED)

1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Tellium, Inc. (the "Company" or "Tellium"), a Delaware corporation, was
incorporated on April 21, 1997 and began business operations on May 8, 1997
(inception date). Tellium designs, develops and markets high-speed, high-
capacity, intelligent optical switching solutions that enable network service
providers to quickly and cost-effectively deliver new high-speed services.

     Tellium has invested a significant amount of its effort and cash in
research and development activities. At December 31, 2000, the Company had
cumulative losses of approximately $156.1 million. For the years ended December
31, 1999 and 2000, the Company incurred negative cash flows from operations of
approximately $21.0 million and $80.0 million, respectively. Operating losses
are expected to continue in 2001.

     The Company is subject to risks common to technology-based companies
including, but not limited to, the development of new technology, development of
markets and distribution channels, dependence on key personnel, and the ability
to obtain additional capital as needed to meet its product plans. The Company's
ultimate success is dependent upon its ability to successfully develop and
market its products and to raise additional capital. To date, the Company has
been funded principally by private equity financing. Management believes that it
has several alternatives available to obtain required capital, including private
placement financing, debt financing, and/or an initial public offering ("IPO").


2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     Unaudited Interim Financial Information--The financial statements as of
March 31, 2001 and for the three months ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 are
unaudited but, in the opinion of management, include all normal recurring
adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of
operations, and cash flows. The results of operations for the three months ended
March 31, 2001 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the
full calendar year 2001 or any other future period.

     Based on operating losses incurred through March 31, 2001 and projected for
the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company did not record an income tax
provision for the three-month period ended March 31, 2001. Total net deferred
tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Unaudited Pro Forma Stockholders' Equity--If the offering contemplated by
this prospectus is consummated, all of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series
D and Series E Preferred Stock outstanding as of the consummation date of the
offering will automatically be converted into common stock. Based on Series A,
Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock outstanding at March
31, 2001, an aggregate of 71,208,903 shares of common stock will be issued upon
conversion at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share. Unaudited
pro forma stockholders' equity at March 31, 2001, assuming the conversion of
Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock into common
stock, is disclosed on the balance sheet.

     Use of Estimates--The preparation of consolidated financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

     Cash and Cash Equivalents--The Company considers all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be
cash equivalents.

     Inventories--Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

     Property and Equipment--Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Maintenance and repair costs
are charged to expense as incurred and renewals and improvements that extend the
useful life of the assets are capitalized. Upon sale or retirement, the cost and
related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the
respective accounts and a resulting gain or loss is reported in operations.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful
life of the property or the term of the lease.

     The estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows:

     Equipment ............     3-5 years
     Furniture and fixtures     3-5 years
     Acquired software ....       3 years
     Leasehold improvements     3-7 years

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Revenue Recognition--The Company recognizes revenue from equipment sales
when the product has been shipped. For transactions where the Company has yet to
obtain customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until terms of acceptance are
satisfied. Sales contracts do not permit the right of return of product by the
customer.

     Software license revenue for software embedded within the Company's optical
switches or its stand alone software products is recognized when a purchase
order has been received or a sales contract has been executed, delivery of the
product and acceptance by the customer have occurred, the license fees are fixed
and determinable, and collection is probable. The portion of revenue that
relates to the Company's obligations to provide customer support, if any, is
deferred, based upon the price charged for customer support when it is sold
separately, and recognized ratably over the maintenance period. Amounts received
in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in the
accompanying balance sheet. Revenue from technical support and maintenance
contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period.

     Revenue and estimated profits on long-term contracts are recognized under
the percentage of completion method of accounting. Profit estimates are revised
periodically based on changes in facts. Any losses on contracts are recognized
immediately. The Company does not have any long-term contracts in process at
December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001.

     The Company has granted warrants to two customer in connection with supply
contracts. The fair value of the warrants earned under the agreement are
recorded as an offset to revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

     Product Warranty--The Company provides for estimated costs to fulfill
customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of related equipment revenue.
Actual warranty costs incurred are charged against the accrual when paid.

     Income Taxes--The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and
their respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
A valuation allowance is recorded if it is "more likely than not" that a portion
or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

     Intangible Assets--Intangible assets are comprised of a license for
intellectual property and purchased core technology which are being amortized
over their estimated useful lives of five years.

     Goodwill--Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired. Goodwill is being amortized over an estimated useful life of
five years.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Fair Value of Financial Instruments--In the opinion of management, the
estimated fair value of the Company's financial instruments, which include cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximates their
carrying value.

     Research and Development Costs--Research and development costs are charged
to expense as incurred.

     Concentration of Credit Risk--Financial instruments which potentially
subject the Company to credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable.
For 1998, one customer accounted for all revenues. For 1999, two customers
accounted for 63% and 27% of revenues, respectively. For 2000, one customer
accounted for approximately 78% of revenues. For the three months ended March
31, 2001, two customers accounted for approximately 70% and 30% of revenues,
respectively. Accounts receivable from two customers represented 63% and 33%,
respectively, of the outstanding balance at December 31, 2000. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and
generally requires no collateral from its customers. The Company maintains
reserves for potential credit losses based upon the credit risk of specified
customers.

     Equity-Based Compensation--The Company accounts for stock-based employee
compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of Accounting Principles
Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and
complies with the disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under APB
Opinion No. 25, compensation expense is based on the difference, if any,
generally on the date of grant, between the fair value of the Company's stock
and the exercise price of the option. The Company accounts for equity
instruments issued to nonemployee vendors in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123 and Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96-18, Accounting
for Equity Instruments That are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or
in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services. All transactions in which goods
or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity
instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued, whichever is more
reliably measurable. The measurement date of the fair value of the equity
instrument issued is the date on which the counterparty's performance is
complete.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Customer Warrant Grants--The Company has granted warrants to customers in
conjunction with the execution of customer supply agreements. Warrants granted
to customers are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF Issue
No. 96-18. In circumstances in which there is no contractual purchase commitment
by the customer, no past relationship between the companies, and no
consideration received for the warrants, the fair value of the warrant is
recorded as selling and marketing expense on the measurement date. If any of the
conditions described above are not met, the fair value of the warrants are
capitalized on the measurement date within stockholders' equity as deferred
warrant costs. Deferred warrant costs are amortized as a pro-rata reduction of
revenue as the customer fulfills its obligations under supply agreements. The
Company evaluates the amortization method for deferred warrant costs based on
facts and circumstances. If it appears that a customer may not be able to
fulfill the amounts it agreed to purchase, the Company will review the deferred
warrant cost for impairment and record adjustments as necessary. Under no
circumstances would the amortization period exceed the term of the supply
agreement. At December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001, management believes that
customers with warrant grants will fulfill their obligations under supply
agreements.

     Software Development Costs--SFAS No. 86, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed, requires the
capitalization of certain software development costs incurred subsequent to the
date technological feasibility is established and prior to the date the product
is generally available for sale. The capitalized cost is then amortized over the
estimated product life. The Company defines technological feasibility as being
attained at the time a working model is completed. To date, the period between
achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such
software has been short and software development costs qualifying for
capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, the Company has not
capitalized any software development costs.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Net Loss Per Share--Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the
net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Weighted average common shares outstanding for
purposes of computing basic net loss per share excludes the unvested portion of
founders stock and restricted stock (see note 7). Outstanding shares of founders
and restricted stock excluded from the basic weighted average shares calculation
because they were not yet vested were 905,400, 231,600, 13,367,235 and
11,529,376 for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the three
months ended March 31, 2001, respectively. Diluted net loss per share is
computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number
of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period,
if dilutive. Potentially dilutive common shares are composed of the incremental
common shares issuable upon the conversion of preferred stock and the exercise
of stock options and warrants, using the treasury stock method. As the effect of
potentially dilutive common shares is anti-dilutive, basic and diluted net loss
per share are the same. For the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 and
the three months ended March 31, 2001, potentially dilutive shares of
27,624,988, 67,535,681, 83,332,293 and 78,423,992, respectively, were excluded
from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation.

     Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted loss per common share are computed as
described above, and also gives effect to the conversion of Series A, Series B,
Series C, Series D and Series E Preferred Stock as if they were converted to
common stock on January 1, 2000. Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted loss per
share also assumes that all unvested founders' stock was vested as of January 1,
2000.

     Segments--The Company has adopted SFAS No.131, Disclosure about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information, which requires companies to report
selected information about operating segments, as well as enterprise-wide
disclosures about products, services, geographic areas, and major customers.
Operating segments are determined based on the way management organizes its
business for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company
has determined that it conducts its operations in one business segment, the
telecommunications network segment. All of the Company's revenues to date are
derived from customers based in the United States.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     Recent Financial Accounting Pronouncements--In June 1998, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as
amended by SFAS 137, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133 and SFAS
138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging
Activities--an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. This statement establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires
recognition of all derivatives as assets or liabilities in the statement of
financial position and measurement of these instruments at fair value. The
statement, as amended, is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. The Company adopted this standard, as amended, on January 1, 2001. The
adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the financial position,
results of operations or cash flows of the Company, as no transition adjustment
was required.

     In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, ("SAB 101") "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements," which provides guidance on the recognition, presentation, and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements filed with the SEC. SAB 101
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provides
guidance for disclosures related to revenue recognition policies. The Company
has reviewed these criteria and believes its policies for revenue recognition to
be in accordance with SAB 101.

     Long-Lived Assets--Whenever events indicate that the carrying values of
long- lived assets, including fixed assets, goodwill and intangible assets, may
not be recoverable, the Company evaluates the carrying value of such assets
using future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the expected undiscounted
future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the Company
will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the fair value
and the carrying value of such asset. Management believes that as of December
31, 2000 and March 31, 2001 the carrying values of long-lived assets are
appropriate.


     Reclassifications--Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to
conform to the current period presentation.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


7.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     Stock Splits--On June 22, 2000, the Company's board of directors approved a
3 for 1 common stock split for shareholders of record as of that date. The split
became effective August 11, 2000. On October 18, 2000, the Company's board of
directors approved a 2 for 1 stock split for shareholders of record as of that
date. The stock split became effective November 6, 2000. All share and per share
information included in these consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the effects of the stock splits for all periods presented.

     Founders' Stock--In May 1997, the founders of the Company purchased
2,604,000 shares of common stock under Management Investor Subscription
Agreements. Under each agreement, these shares are subject to a vesting schedule
principally over a four-year period. In the event of termination of employment,
the Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares at par value. If the
termination was for cause (as defined), the Company holds the right to
repurchase for one year from the termination date. If the termination was
without cause, because of employee resignation or death/disability, the Company
holds the right to repurchase for 120 days. After the time period has lapsed,
all unvested shares become immediately vested. The Company's right to repurchase
unvested shares of founders' stock upon termination of employment terminates
upon completion of a qualified offering (as defined).

     Restricted Stock--During the year ended December 31, 2000, certain
employees exercised stock options for 19,090,599 shares of common stock. The
consideration given by the employees were full recourse notes with a 7.5%
interest rate. Upon exercise, the employees received 19,090,599 shares of
restricted common stock. The restricted stock generally vests 25% on the first
anniversary of the issuance date and then pro-rata on a monthly basis during the
next three years. The Company has the right to repurchase any unvested shares at
the price per share paid by the employee, plus accrued interest, during the
one-year period following the termination of employment, for any reason, with or
without cause. The repurchase right lapses after one year, and all unvested
shares become immediately vested.

     Preferred Stock--The Company is authorized to issue 10,322,917 shares of
$.001 par value Series A Preferred Stock, 233,333 shares of $.001 par value
Series B Preferred Stock, 2,593,974 shares of $.001 par value Series C Preferred
Stock, 6,010,926 shares of $.001 par value Series D Preferred Stock and
7,500,000 shares of $0.001 par value Series E Preferred Stock.

     On May 8, 1997, the initial investors in the Company entered into a stock
purchase and contribution agreement (the "Agreement"). In accordance with the
Agreement, cash investors were issued 4,850,000 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at $2.40 per share and 233,333 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at $2.40
per share.

     Significant terms of Series A, Series B, Series C and Series D Preferred
Stock are as follows:

     .    Each share of Series A, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock is
          convertible into common stock at the option of the holder, at any
          time, at a conversion price of $2.40 per share for Series A and $9.15
          per share for Series C and Series D. The conversion price is subject
          to adjustments for events of dilution as specified in the certificate
          of incorporation. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock is
          convertible at the option of the holder, at any time, into one share
          of Series A Preferred Stock.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     All shares of Series A, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock
     automatically convert, without any action by the holder, into common stock
     based on the then applicable Series A, Series C, and Series D conversion
     price in the event of either a qualified IPO (as defined) or upon the
     conversion of specified percentages of the related Preferred Stock. Based
     on certain rights held by the holders of Series C Preferred Stock, upon
     effectiveness of a qualified IPO and conversion of our preferred stock,
     holders of Series C Preferred Stock will receive approximately an
     additional 51,000 shares of common stock. All shares of Series B Preferred
     Stock automatically convert, without any action by the holder, into common
     stock based on the then applicable conversion price for the Series A
     Preferred Stock in the event of the automatic conversion of Series A,
     Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock.

 .    The holders of Series A, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock have voting
     rights equal to the equivalent number of shares of common stock while
     Series B Preferred Stock has no voting rights.

 .    Dividends may be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
     are noncumulative. Dividends for Preferred Stock have to be paid and
     declared equivalent to the per-share dividend on common stock.

 .    In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or
     winding up of the Company, the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and
     Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive out of the assets of the
     Company, whether such assets derive from capital or surplus, an amount
     equal to $2.40 per share in the case of Series A and Series B Preferred
     Stock and $9.15 per share in the case of Series C and Series D Preferred
     Stock (subject to adjustment for any stock splits, reverse splits or
     similar capitalization affecting such shares), plus any declared but unpaid
     dividends on such shares. Payment of the liquidation preference to holders
     of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock will be made
     pro rata among the Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred
     Stock based on the respective liquidation preference of each such class
     until each such class receives its full liquidation, before any payment is
     made or any assets distributed to the holders of common stock or any other
     shares ranking on liquidation junior to the Series A, Series B, Series C,
     and Series D Preferred Stock.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     After payment of the liquidation preference to holders of Series A, Series
     B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock, the holders of Series A, Series
     B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to share in the
     distribution of any remaining assets of the Company on the same basis as if
     the holders of Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock
     had converted their shares into common stock.

     On September 20, 2000, the Company issued 7,274,413 shares of Series E
Preferred Stock at $30 per share. Proceeds raised were $212,495,174, net of
issuance costs of $5,737,216. The Series E Preferred Stock automatically
converts into common stock upon an IPO, based on the IPO price. If an IPO does
not occur by September 30, 2002, the Series E Preferred Stock converts into
common stock at $10 per share. Should the Series E Preferred Stock be
automatically converted to common stock on September 30, 2002, the Company will
record a deemed dividend to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock, reflecting
the embedded beneficial conversion feature. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Company, holders of Series E Preferred Stock
will be entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $30 per share. If a
liquidation event occurs prior to September 30, 2002, the consideration to be
received by Series E Preferred Stock holders is capped. The Series E Preferred
Stock has voting, dividend, and anti-dilution rights similar to the Series A,
Series C, and Series D Preferred Stock.

     As the terms of the Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, and Series E
Preferred Stock include deemed liquidation events where cash redemption of the
securities could be triggered by a merger, consolidation, or sale of
substantially all of the Company's assets, all classes of preferred stock have
been classified outside of stockholders' equity.

     Other Common Stock Issuances--In conjunction with the execution of a
customer supply agreement in September 2000, the Company sold 333,333 shares of
common stock to officers and affiliates of a customer at $15 per share. The
Company issued 1.5 million shares of common stock on September 1, 2000 to
acquire a license from AT&T. On October 10, 2000, the Company issued 3,749,942
shares of common stock to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Astarte Fiber
Networks, Inc. ("Astarte"). See Note 13.

granting of both incentive and nonqualified stock options and other awards for

     The Company has granted 530,223 options (included in the table above) to
employees during the year ended December 31, 2000 that vest only upon the
attainment of certain performance criteria. As such, a measurement date for
these stock options had not been met under APB Opinion No. 25. The options
expired during the first three months ended March 31, 2001, as the performance
milestones were not met by the employees. The Company has granted 267,500 and
470,017 options (included in the table above) under the Option Plans to non-
employees during the year ended December 31, 2000 and the three months ended
March 31, 2001, respectively. These options vest either as the non-employee
performs services for the Company or upon the attainment of performance
milestones. The measurement date of the fair value of the options is the date on
which the non-employees' performance is complete. At December 31, 2000 and March
31, 2001, a measurement date has been reached and vesting has occurred for
142,258 and 477,025 of these options, respectively. The fair value of the vested
options at December 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001 was $3,202,034 and $5,811,480,
respectively. Additionally, there were 150,000 options granted to non-employees
outside of the Option Plans during January 2000 (not included in the table
above). The options became fully vested in January 2000. The fair value of the
vested options was approximately $260,471. At December 31, 2000 and March 31,
2001, 75,000 of these options remain unexercised. There were 200,000 options
granted to directors outside of the Option Plans during October 2000 (not
included in the table above). The options granted to directors vested 50% upon
issuance and the remaining balance at the earlier of the first anniversary date

     In connection with the grant of stock options to employees and non-employee
directors in 1998, 1999, 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, the
Company recorded deferred stock compensation of $2,130,000, $14,391,419,
$221,178,267 and $7,953,645, respectively, for the difference between the
exercise price and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of
the grant. Such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders' equity and

_______________
(1)  In conjunction with executing a supply contract with a customer in
     September 1999, the Company granted a warrant to purchase up to 5,226,000
     shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $3.05 per
     share. Upon execution of the agreement, 1,045,200 of the shares subject to
     the warrant vested, with the vesting of the remaining shares dependent upon
     the volume of the customer's purchases from the Company. As the 1,045,200
     warrants vested upon execution of the supply agreement and are not subject
     to forfeiture, a measurement date has occurred for those warrants, and a
     charge of $1,048,707 was recorded to sales and marketing expense (as there
     was no contractual purchase commitment) for the year ended December 31,
     1999 to reflect the fair value of the warrants at grant date. Under the
     terms of the original agreement, the vesting of the remaining warrants was
     dependent upon purchases made by the customer. Therefore, variable plan
     accounting was used and related charges varied each accounting period until
     a measurement date occurred. A measurement date occurred when customer
     purchases reached certain specified levels. In November 2000, the terms of
     the Company's warrant agreement with the customer were amended, to

     immediately vest all of the remaining shares subject to the warrants. The
     shares subject to the warrants become exercisable based on the schedule of
     milestones previously contained in the original agreement. If the
     milestones are not reached by March 31, 2005, the remaining unexercised
     shares subject to the warrant shall then become exercisable. As a result of
     this amendment a measurement date has been reached. In connection with the
     execution of this amendment, the Company recorded the fair value of the
     warrants, $90.6 million, as deferred warrant costs within stockholders'
     equity. This charge will be recorded as a reduction of revenue as the
     customer makes purchases under the agreement. Charges of $584,062
     $2,445,481 and $4,259,034 have been recorded as an offset to gross revenue
     for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended
     March 31, 2001, respectively, to reflect the fair value of the warrants
     earned by the customer based upon purchases through that date. Fair value
     is determined utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
     utilized by the Company in its Black-Scholes calculations include
     volatility of 80%, expected life of 3 years, and a risk free interest rate
     of 6%.

     Note 8).

(3)  In conjunction with the execution of a customer supply agreement in
     September 2000, the Company granted a warrant to purchase 2,000,000 shares
     of common stock at an exercise price of $30 per share. All of the warrants
     vested upon execution of the agreement. Of the 2,000,000 shares, 1,000,000
     are now exercisable, and the remaining 1,000,000 are exercisable at the
     earlier of five years or upon completion of purchase levels indicated in
     the agreement. As the warrants vested upon execution of the agreement and
     are not subject to forfeiture, the fair value of approximately $34.5
     million was determined upon execution of the agreement. The fair value of
     the warrants was calculated using the Black-Scholes Model with the
     following assumptions used: no dividend yield; a risk free interest rate of
     6.25%; expected volatility of 80%; and expected life of 3.25 years. The
     fair value of the warrants will be recorded as an offset to revenue as
     purchases are made. Charges of $328,297 and $530,619 have been recorded as
     an offset to gross revenue for the year ended December 31, 2000 and the
     three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively, to reflect the fair value
     of the warrants earned by the customer based upon purchases through that
     date.

financing with the then preferred stockholders. At December 31, 1998, $9,392,030
of proceeds were received, with the remaining financing received in January
1999. The bridge financing agreement took the form of Senior Convertible Notes
with an interest rate of 18% per annum and was scheduled to mature upon the
earlier of the closing of a next round of financing, June 30, 1999, or a sale
transaction (as defined in the agreement). As part of this transaction, the

of Series A Preferred Stock at an exercise price equal to 50% of the price paid
for preferred stock in the succeeding round of financing, or $2.40 per share if
a preferred stock financing transaction did not take place by June 30, 1999. The
warrants were exercisable at any time at the option of the holder and were to
expire on June 30, 2000 or in the event of a qualified IPO. Prior to June 30,
2000, 906,250 warrants were exercised, resulting in proceeds of $4,146,120. The
remaining warrants expired.

     In conjunction with the issuance of Series C Preferred Stock on February
11, 1999 (see Note 7), the $16 million bridge financing and related accrued
interest were converted into Series C Preferred Stock at $9.15 per share.

     As part of the bridge financing agreement, the Company approved the
authorization of 7 million shares of Series C Preferred Stock and an additional
authorization of 1.5 million shares of Series A Preferred Stock, both with a par
value of $0.001.

     On June 30, 1999, the Company entered into a $5 million bridge financing
agreement with current preferred stockholders. The bridge financing agreement
was secured via a Senior Promissory Note with an interest rate of 9.75% per
annum and was scheduled to mature upon the earlier of December 26, 1999 or the
closing of a sale transaction (as defined in the agreement). In conjunction with
the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock on November 30, 1999 (see Note 7), the
$5 million Senior Promissory Note and accrued interest were converted into
Series D Preferred Stock at $9.15 per share.

of the Company's equipment and bear interest of 7.5% per annum. The remaining
principal amounts of $970,424 and $252,647 are payable in monthly installments

d.   Lines of Credit

     On November 11, 1999, Tellium obtained a $4,000,000 lease-line of credit
from Comdisco. The line of credit bears an interest rate of 7.5% and expires on
November 10, 2002. At December 31, 1999, the Company had not drawn any amount
under this agreement. At December 31, 2000, the Company had drawn approximately
$4.0 million under this agreement.

     In consideration of such line of credit, Tellium issued warrants to
Comdisco to purchase 29,509 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at an exercise
price of $9.15 per share. The warrants vested immediately upon execution of the
agreement. Vested warrants are exercisable at any time at the option of the
holder and expire on November 10, 2009, or after five years from the effective

Company recorded deferred financing expense of $150,196 based on the fair value
of the warrants. Such cost are included in other assets in the accompanying
balance sheet and are amortized over the life of the line of credit.
Amortization expense was $4,172, $50,064, $12,516 for the years ended December
31, 1999 and 2000 and the three months ended March 31, 2001, respectively.

     During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company entered into a
$10,000,000 line of credit with a bank. The line of credit bears interest at
6.75% and expires on June 30, 2001. The outstanding balance on this line of
credit at December 31, 2000 was $4,000,000.

13.  ACQUISITION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT

     On September 1, 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with AT&T Corp.
to license certain intellectual property in exchange for 1,500,000 shares of
Tellium common stock with a fair value of $45 million. The license has been
recorded in intangible assets on the balance sheet and is being amortized over
its estimated useful life of five years.

     On October 10, 2000, the Company acquired Astarte by issuing 3,749,942
shares of its common stock to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Astarte.
Astarte developed, manufactured, and sold switches for use in optical networks.
The Company has acquired Astarte primarily for its intellectual property. The
acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method and the results of
operations for Astarte are included with the Company beginning October 10, 2000.
The common stock issued by the Company was valued at $112.5 million.
Identifiable intangible assets and goodwill will be amortized over their
estimated useful life of five years. The allocation of the fair value of the net
assets acquired is as follows:


     Net Liabilities...  $    (835,774)
     Core Technology...     36,000,000
     Goodwill .........     77,335,774

     The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the
combined results of operations of the Company and Astarte as if Astarte had been
acquired on the first day of each period. The unaudited pro forma basis
financial information also assumes that the license of intellectual property
from AT&T had occurred on January 1, 1999. The summary includes the impact of
certain adjustments, such as goodwill and intangible asset amortization and the
number of shares outstanding. The unaudited pro forma financial information is
not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the
transactions occurred on January 1, 1999, nor are they intended to be a
projection of future results.

14.  Subsequent Events

     On April 10, 2001, in conjunction with the amendment of a customer supply
agreement to increase the customer's minimum purchase commitment, the Company
granted a warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an
exercise price of $14.00 per share. The warrant is immediately vested and is
exercisable at the earlier of the customer meeting its purchase milestone or six
years from the date of the grant. The fair value of the warrant, approximately
$3.5 million, will be recorded as an offset to revenue as purchases are made.
The Company had previously issued warrants to the customer for 2,000,000 shares
of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of that agreement, the exercise price of
the warrants has been adjusted to $14.00 per share.

                        AS OF DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998
         (Information as of September 30, 2000 and for the nine months
         ended September 30, 1999 and September 30, 2000 is unaudited)

1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND RISK FACTORS:

Description of Business

     Astarte Fiber Networks, Inc. (the "Company"), was incorporated in October
1990 to design, manufacture and sell optical ("photonic") switches for use in
fiber optic networks. Current customers are users of fiber optic networks such
as companies in the telephone, cable television, aerospace and financial
services industries, as well as civilian and governmental data communication
computer centers. The Company completed the release of its initial generation of
switches and began generating revenues during 1995. The Company's current
activities are primarily focused on developing a next generation of switches,
which are expected to provide substantially expanded switching capacity. These
larger capacity, single mode switches are expected to be used primarily by the
telecommunications industry.

     On October 10, 2000, the Company was acquired by Tellium, Inc. ("Tellium"),
a telecommunications equipment and service provider, in an exchange of shares
intended to constitute a tax free reorganization under Internal Revenue Service
regulations. After the acquisition, the Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Tellium and as such, the Company's future operations will be funded by
Tellium.

     The unaudited interim financial statements as of September 30, 2000 and for
the nine months ended September 30, 1999 and 2000 have been prepared on the same
basis as the audited financial statements and, in the opinion of management,
reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial information set forth therein, in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. The results of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of
the operating results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2000.


2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash and cash equivalents include investments in highly liquid instruments
with an original maturity of three months or less.


Inventories

     Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method of
valuation) or market, and consist primarily of raw materials such as printed
circuit boards and other electronic components. Writedowns for excess and
obsolete inventories are charged to expense in the period when conditions giving
rise to the writedowns are first recognized.


  The following is a summary of inventories at December 31:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


Income Taxes

     The Company follows Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 109, which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be
recorded for the estimated future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the
accompanying balance sheets, and for operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards.

     The current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated
amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed or to be filed for each year.

     The change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the period
measures the deferred income tax provision or benefit for the period. Effects of
changes in enacted tax laws on deferred income tax assets or liabilities are
reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of
enactment. The measurement of deferred income tax assets may be reduced by a
valuation allowance, based on judgmental assessment of available evidence, to
the extent it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income
tax assets will not be realized (Note 6).


Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable,
notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate their
carrying amounts as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and at September 30, 2000
(unaudited).


Revenue Recognition

     The Company recognizes revenue when products are shipped, evidence of an
arrangement exists, the selling price is fixed, and collectibility is reasonably
assured.


Research and Development

     Research and development costs, consisting primarily of salaries, supplies
and contract services, are expensed as incurred.

Concentration of Credit Risk and Sales

     The Company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial
condition and generally does not require collateral. Its accounts receivable
balances are primarily domestic and are due from the U. S. Navy and large
telecommunications and research and development companies. As of December 31,
1999 and 1998, three or fewer customers accounted for approximately 70% and 87%,
respectively, of the Company's accounts receivable balances and for 83% and 49%,
respectively, of the Company's sales during the years then ended. The Company
has no significant off- balance sheet concentration of credit risk such as
foreign exchange, option, or other foreign hedging contracts.


Stock-Based Compensation Plans

     The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation arrangements using
the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB No. 25"), under which,
generally, no compensation is recognized if the exercise price of options
granted equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on date of
grant. The Company has adopted the disclosure option of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123"). SFAS 123 requires companies that do not account for stock-based
compensation under the fair value method prescribed by the statement to disclose
pro forma earnings as if the fair value method had been adopted. Additionally,
certain other disclosures are required with respect to stock compensation and
the assumptions used to determine the pro forma effects of SFAS 123.

     The Company applies SFAS 123, EITF 96-18 "Accounting for Equity Instruments
That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with
Selling, Goods or Services," EITF 96-13 "Accounting for Derivative Financial
Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock," and
other related guidance to stock-based transactions with non-employees.


Comprehensive Income

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting
Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in a financial statement. Comprehensive
income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period
from non-owner sources. For all periods presented, net loss is the same as
comprehensive loss.

Reclassifications

     Certain reclassifications have been made in the 1998 financial statements
to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no
impact on the Company's net loss or stockholders' equity as previously reported.


Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS
No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every
derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in
other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or
liability measured at its fair value. It also requires that changes in the
derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific
hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges
allows a derivative's gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged
item in the income statement, and requires that a company must formally
document, designate, and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive
hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 may not be applied retroactively, and must be
applied to (a) derivative instruments and (b) certain derivative instruments
embedded in hybrid contracts that were issued, acquired, or substantively
modified after December 31, 1997 (and, at the company's election, before January
1, 1998). SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000. The Company has not historically utilized such instruments, and has no
current plans to do so. Accordingly, management believes that the impact of SFAS
No. 133 will not significantly affect its financial reporting.

     In March 2000, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation" ("FIN No. 44"). FIN No. 44
clarifies the applications of APB No. 25 for certain issues related to equity-
based instruments issued to employees. FIN No. 44 is effective on July 1, 2000,
except for certain transactions, and is applied on a prospective basis.

3.   DEBT:

Bank Financing Facility

     During 1999, the Company borrowed $689,735 under a bank line of credit,
which bore interest at rates ranging from 7.75% to 8.0%. These borrowings, which
were secured by personal assets of a stockholder and member of the Board of
Directors, were repaid during that year. The line of credit expired during 1999.


Capital Lease Obligations

     During 1997, the Company entered into three capital lease obligations for
computer equipment. Minimum payments are $2,717 per month, including imputed
interest of 17.3% per annum. The leases mature in July 2002 and have as
collateral the related assets, which had a net book value of $51,755 and $69,925
at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for the years
ending December 31:

Notes Payable to Stockholders and Other Related Parties

     The Company has from time to time arranged for borrowings from stockholders
and other related parties. A summary of those transactions is as follows:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


Debt Converted Into Series A and B Preferred Stock

     In 1990, the Company entered into a borrowing facility with four
stockholders, whereby loans could be drawn at any time until maturity, up to a
maximum principal amount of $6.5 million. These notes, which bore interest at
10%, were secured by substantially all the assets of the Company. In 1994,
unsecured additional stockholder loans were made to the Company, also bearing
interest at 10%. During 1998, all remaining balances, totaling $2,121,005,
including accrued interest of $237,991, under these borrowing arrangements were
converted to 4,328,582 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at $.49 per share.

     In 1993, the Company arranged for unsecured borrowings from related parties
totaling $156,164, which bore interest at 10%. The outstanding balances,
totaling $179,643, including accrued interest of $23,477, were converted to
366,619 shares of Series A Preferred Stock in June 1998 at $.49 per share.

     During 1995 and continuing into 1996, under a private placement, the
Company raised $900,000 and incurred an additional $100,000 of debt as a
finder's fee to a member of the Board of Directors. Interest of 10% on the $1.0
million of debt, which was unsecured, was payable quarterly beginning in 1997.
The note holders received an aggregate of 2.1 million shares of the Company's
common stock as of January 1, 1996. The Company has the right of first refusal
on the subsequent sale of shares issued under this agreement. Under terms of the
loan, $1.0 million of this debt was converted to 2,040,815 shares of Series B
Preferred Stock in June 1998 at $.49 per share, and minor amounts were paid in
cash in 1997 and 1998. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, amounts due related to
these obligations totaled $258,338 (including accrued interest of $34,130) and
$253,393, respectively.

     During 1996, the Company raised an additional $1,700,000 in an unsecured
private placement offering. A finder's fee of $97,500, accounted for as interest
expense since the debt was due on demand, was paid to a member of the Board of
Directors. The debt bore interest at 12%. Debt holders were given the
opportunity to convert the debt and accrued interest to shares of Series A
Preferred Stock at $.30 per share. Substantially all of the remaining balance
not converted in 1997, totaling $695,627, including accrued interest of
$120,627, was converted in March 1998 to 2,318,757 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at $.30 per share. Remaining interest obligations under this facility were
$22,384 and $20,342, respectively, as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     From time to time during 1997 and 1998, the Company borrowed additional
funds for working capital purposes from related parties under short-term
agreements, at interest rates ranging from 10% to 12%. During 1998,
substantially all of the debt payable to these related parties, totaling
$1,913,035, including accrued interest of $116,310, was converted to 2,991,185
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 912,968 shares of Series B stock in June
1998 at $.49 per share.

     In June 1998, $1,062,500 of notes payable to a bank, which had been secured
by personal assets and guarantees of two stockholders who are also members of
the Board of Directors, were assumed by those individuals. Substantially all of
the resulting debt payable to these stockholders was converted to 1,867,347
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 295,918 shares of Series B Preferred
Stock at $.49 per share in June 1998.


Interim Financing By Related Parties

     In December 1999, the Company offered existing shareholders and option
holders the opportunity to participate in an interim financing arrangement.
Notes issued under the arrangement have a stated interest rate of 12%, and are
due on November 30, 2000. Under this offer, the Company received proceeds of
$502,398 in December 1999 and $500,000 in January 2000.

     In addition to the interest, the note holders will also receive 5% of the
amount loaned ("Additional Interest") which is included in accrued interest on
the balance sheet. In addition, for every dollar loaned, the note holders
receive warrants to buy four shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of
$.50 per share. Therefore, the Company has attributed a portion of the proceeds
from the debt offering to the fair value of the warrants. Using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model, the 2,009,592 warrants issued in December 1999
were valued at $79,060. The 2,000,000 warrants issued in January 2000 were
valued at $78,683. For purposes of valuation, the following assumptions were
used: risk-free interest rate of approximately 6%, contractual life of 3 years,
expected volatility rate of 60%, and expected dividends of 0%. Both the
Additional Interest of $25,120 and the fair value of the warrants as of December
31, 1999 have been recorded as an initial discount to the carrying value of the
related debt. This initial discount is being amortized over the one-year term of
the note, using the effective interest-rate method.

     The Company may prepay the loans without penalty. In the event of default,
interest on the unpaid balance is payable at 18%.

4.   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Employee Stock Option Plan

     The Company's Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Plan"), adopted effective
December 31, 1996, authorizes the granting to eligible employees of incentive
and nonqualified stock options or restricted stock to acquire up to 9,000,000
shares of its common stock. Administration of the Plan is by the Incentive Plan
Committee, consisting of two disinterested members of the Board of Directors.
The Incentive Plan Committee, in its sole discretion, selects Participants, the
form and amount of each award, and any other terms considered necessary or
desirable, consistent with the terms of the Plan. Awards granted prior to 1997
vested immediately. Awards after December 31, 1996 vest 25% twelve months from
the date of grant, with the remainder vesting in equal monthly installments over
the following 36 months, or upon specified Transfers of Control. The options
generally terminate after 10 years. Incentive stock options may be granted at an
exercise price not less than fair market value on the date of grant.

     A summary of the status of the Plan as of December 31, 1999, 1998 and
September 30, 2000 and activity during the periods then ended is as follows:

     If the fair value method had been used for options granted during 1999 and
1998, the fair value of options granted would have been $29,924 and $3,891,
respectively. The pro forma effect on the reported net loss would have been
additional expense of $4,745 and $5,645, in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The
risk-free interest rate, expected volatility rate, expected life and expected
dividends are approximately 6%, .001%, 10 years and 0%, respectively, for both
years. The weighted average remaining contractual life for stock options
outstanding as of December 31, 1999 was 7.96 years.

Other Stock Option Awards

     In December 1998, the Board of Directors granted to the Company's president
an option to acquire 1,728,945 shares of the Company's common stock at $.15 per
share. The option vests in 25% increments on the anniversary of the grant. As of
December 31, 1999, 432,236 options were vested and exercisable. Because the
option agreement permits either cash or cashless exercise, compensation expense
is required to be measured at interim financial reporting dates, under the rules
of variable plan accounting. If the value of the Company's common stock exceeds
the option exercise price before the options are exercised, compensation expense
will be recorded as the difference between the value of the underlying common
stock and the grant price, times the number of remaining options,
notwithstanding their exercisability. No compensation expense was recorded
during 1999 or 1998 under this award. However, the Company did record a
$1,470,000 charge for financial reporting purposes during the nine-month period
ended September 30, 2000 under this award (unaudited).

     A 1995 employment agreement with a former executive provided for a grant of
options based on the number of diluted shares of the Company's stock
outstanding. In December 1999, in satisfaction of obligations under the
employment agreement, the Company granted the former executive a non-qualified
option to acquire up to 210,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $.30 per
share. The options are exercisable at any time prior to January 1, 2001. In
September 2000, this option was modified such that it is treated as an option
granted to non-employees for accounting purposes. Compensation expense of
$195,000 (unaudited) was recorded for financial reporting purposes during the
nine months ended September 30, 2000 related to this award using the Black-
Scholes option pricing model and the following assumptions: risk-free interest
rate of approximately 6%, contractual life of 3 years, expected volatility rate
of 60%, and expected dividends of 0% (unaudited).


401(k) Profit Sharing Plan

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Company established the Astarte, Inc. 401(k)
Profit Sharing Plan, which is governed by Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Employees with a minimum of one month of service as of a semi-annual Entry
Date may participate. Employees are also eligible to receive discretionary
employer contributions, provided they are employed as of the last day of a plan
year during which they have worked at least 1,000 hours. Employee and
discretionary employer contributions to the plan are immediately vested. The
Company made discretionary matching contributions of $15,910 and $17,821 for
1999 and 1998, respectively.

5.   CAPITAL STOCK:

     The Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, (the "Articles")
authorize three classes of stock: common, Series A Convertible Preferred, and
Series B Convertible Preferred, and designate the number of authorized shares to
be 50,000,000 for common stock, 60,000,000 for Class A Convertible Preferred,
and 40,000,000 for Class B Convertible Preferred. The Articles further authorize
the Board of Directors to adjust the number of shares of each class, provided
that the rights of any class may not be decreased and no more than 150,000,000
may be outstanding.

     Rights, preferences, and privileges of the various categories of stock are
as follows:

     Dividends. Holders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to
dividends only in the event that, and to the extent of, any dividends on common
stock.

     Voting Rights. Holders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are
entitled to vote with holders of common stock as a single voting group on the
basis of the number of common shares into which the shares of preferred stock
may be converted.

     Liquidation Rights. In the event of a liquidation or winding up of the
Company or a consolidation or merger where the Company is not the surviving
entity, the order of liquidation rights is as follows:

     .    holders of Series A Preferred Stock are first entitled to receive the
          acquisition price of their shares plus any declared but unpaid
          dividends,

     .    holders of Series B Preferred Stock are then entitled to receive the
          acquisition price of their shares plus any declared but unpaid
          dividends, and

     .    any remainder is then to be distributed ratably among holders of the
          Company's common stock.

     Preferred Stock Redemption Rights. Holders of Series A and Series B
Preferred Stock may, after four years and five years, respectively, from the
date of issuance, redeem their shares at the acquisition price of the shares,
plus 10% per annum since the date of issuance. The recorded amounts are accreted
to the redemption price using the effective interest method. The accretion is
charged to retained earnings and deducted in arriving at net loss applicable to
common stockholders.

     Preferred Stock Conversion Rights. Shares of both Series A and Series B
Preferred Stock may at any time be converted into common stock on a one-for-one
basis, subject to anti-dilution provisions. All preferred shares will
automatically convert upon the earlier of: (1) the closing of an underwriting of
common stock in which the aggregate price paid by the public is at least $5.0
million and the offering price is at least 150% of the then applicable
redemption value or (2) the written consent of holders of at least two thirds of
the shares of each series of Preferred Stock with respect to that series.


Warrants

     In December 1999 and January 2000, the Company issued 2,009,592 and
2,000,000 warrants, respectively, to note holders in conjunction with issuance
of debt on those dates (see Note 3).


6.   INCOME TAXES:

     Effective January 1, 1996 the Company became a C corporation. As of
December 31, 1999, federal net operating loss carry-forwards generated since
January 1, 1996 are approximately $11,600,000.

     A tax benefit has not been recognized in 1999 or 1998 due to the
establishment of valuation allowances.

     The components of the net deferred income tax asset were as follows:

     Income taxes computed using the federal statutory income tax rate differ
from the Company's effective tax rate primarily as a result of state taxes and
the increase in the valuation allowance as follows:

     Deferred income taxes primarily result from basis differences in
inventories, certain accruals not currently deductible for tax purposes and net
operating loss carry-forwards. The deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a
valuation allowance, due to the Company's history of operating losses.

     The Company's net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates
beginning in 2005 and continuing through 2019. The Tax Reform Act of 1986
contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss carry-forwards
available for use in any given year if certain events occur, including changes
in ownership interests.

7.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Operating Leases

     As of December 31, 1999, the Company occupied approximately 24,000 square
feet of manufacturing and office space under a lease that extends until March
2004. Effective August 1, 2000, the Company reduced the square feet leased to
10,745. Including its pro rata share of operating expenses, the Company paid
approximately $313,000 and $206,000 during 1999 and 1998, respectively, under
terms of this lease. Future minimum lease payments (excluding operating
expenses, and reflective of the August 1, 2000 amendment) are as follows:


     2000  .....................  $209,587
     2001  .....................   123,236
     2002  .....................   126,933
     2003  .....................   130,741
     2004  .....................    21,896

                                  --------
            Total  .............  $612,393
                                  ========


Purchase Commitments

     In the normal course of business, the Company enters into various long-term
commitments with vendors to provide customized components for use in the
Company's products. Dependence on vendors as sole source suppliers or the
Company's inability to meet minimum volume requirements under purchase
commitments could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations or financial condition.

     In 1996, the Company entered into an agreement for the development and
supply of a micro-electromechanical system for use in its next generation of
optical switches. Under the agreement, the Company must purchase all of its
requirements for this component from this vendor. Further, to retain exclusive
rights to this technology in optical switch applications, the Company must meet
as yet to be determined minimum volume commitments.

Royalty and License Agreement

     Under a royalty and license agreement with a former key employee and
current consultant and stockholder, royalties accrue and are payable on a
monthly basis at a rate of 2.5% of net sales, as defined, subject to a minimum
royalty of $100,000 per year. This minimum royalty was paid in 1999 and 1998.
This agreement provides that there will be no royalty during any period when the
individual is an employee. Since March 1997, this individual has been a
consultant to the Company, under terms of a consulting agreement that was
terminated on June 2, 2000.


Litigation

     From time to time, the Company is involved in certain litigious actions in
the ordinary course of business. Management believes that resolution of such
actions would not have a significant adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.


8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED):

     On June 19, 2000, the Company borrowed $300,000 under a line of credit,
which bears interest at 9.5%, and is secured by a certificate of deposit in the
name of a related party. The note is further secured by all of the Company's
accounts receivable. The loan matures on October 13, 2000.

     As of September 13, 2000, options to purchase 4,891,541 shares of common
stock, previously granted to employees under the Employee Stock Option plan and
through other option awards, were exercised. Also as of that date, warrants to
purchase 4,009,592 shares of Series A Preferred stock, issued in conjunction
with the interim financing by related parties, were exercised. Substantially all
of such exercises were financed through the issuance of notes receivable.
Exercise of certain of these options and warrants by issuance of the notes
receivable was deemed to be a modification of the original option and warrant
agreements and resulted in compensation expense for financial reporting purposes
of $2,270,000 and additional interest expense of $880,000 for the options and
warrants, respectively. This compensation expense is in addition to the
$1,665,000 charge also recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2000 as
discussed in Note 4. Subsequent to September 30, 2000, such notes were repaid.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     On September 13, 2000 holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of
Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, separately with respect to each series,
consented to the conversion of their shares into common stock on a one-for-one
basis, with the result that all shares of preferred stock outstanding were
converted into common stock. Upon such conversion, 39,445,667 shares of Series A
and 23,594,398 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were converted into 63,040,065
shares of common stock.

     In September 2000, certain technology related to optical switch design (the
"Design Technology") as well as the rights to receive additional payments with
respect thereto were transferred to a wholly-owned limited liability company at
its net book value of zero. The equity interests in this limited liability
company were subsequently distributed to the stockholders. This limited
liability company is no longer affiliated with the Company or Tellium. The
Company and its successor retain a paid-up, non-exclusive license for use of the
Design Technology. On October 3, 2000, the Company licensed certain other
technology related to optical switch design (the "Switch Technology") to a major
company in the optical networking industry for $10 million. These funds were
used to pay off existing indebtedness, including certain taxes and other
liabilities associated with the transaction. The remaining funds of
approximately $2.75 million were distributed to the stockholders. The Company
and its successor (Tellium) retain ownership and use of the Switch Technology.

                  Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Data

     On September 1, 2000, the Company acquired intellectual property from AT&T
by issuing 1.5 million shares of its common stock. On October 10, 2000, the
Company completed its acquisition of Astarte Fiber Networks, Inc. ("Astarte") by
issuing 3,749,942 shares of its common stock. All outstanding preferred stock,
warrants, and stock options of Astarte were converted to common stock of Astarte
in conjunction with the closing of our purchase of Astarte.

     The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Data consists of an
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Statement of Operations
gives effect to the acquisition of Astarte and to the license of intellectual
property from AT&T, as if they occurred on January 1, 2000.

     The pro forma financial data is presented for informational purposes only
and does not purport to represent what the Company's results of operations would
have been had the Astarte acquisition and the license of intellectual property
from AT&T, in fact occurred on the dates assumed or that may result from future
operations. The pro forma data should be read in conjunction with the Company's
Financial Statements and Astarte's financial statements and related notes
thereto, both of which are included elsewhere in the Prospectus.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements

The following adjustments have been reflected in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Statements of Operations:

A.   To reflect the historical results of operations of Astarte for the period
     prior to acquisition.

B.   To reflect the incremental amortization of goodwill and other intangible
     assets resulting from the acquisition of Astarte and the license of
     intellectual property from AT&T. An amortization period of five years will
     be used by the Company for goodwill and intangible assets. The acquisition
     of Astarte will be accounted for using the purchase method whereby the net
     tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities
     assumed are recognized at their estimated fair values at the date of
     acquisition.

Item 14.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

     Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law empowers a Delaware
corporation to indemnify its officers and directors and specific other persons
to the extent and under the circumstances set forth therein.

     Under Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation eliminates the personal
liability of a director to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liabilities
arising (a) from any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation
or its stockholders; (b) from acts or omissions not in good faith or which
involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (c) under Section
174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or (d) from any transaction from
which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

     Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires us to
indemnify our directors and officers to the extent permitted under Section 145
of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation provides that we shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any actual or threatened action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason
of the fact that he is or was a director or officer of Tellium, or is or was
serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise, whether the basis of the proceeding is alleged action
in an official capacity as a director or officer or in any other capacity while
so serving, to the full extent authorized by

                                      II-1
<PAGE>

the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     The above discussion of Section 145 and of our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation is not intended to be exhaustive and is
respectively qualified in its entirety by such statute and our Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

     We have obtained primary and excess insurance policies insuring our
directors and officers and those of our subsidiaries against some liabilities
they may incur in their capacity as directors and officers. Under such policies,
the insurer, on our behalf, may also pay amounts for which we have granted
indemnification to the directors or officers.


Item 15.  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

     Since our inception, we have issued securities in the following

Item 17.  Undertakings.

     (a)  Rule 415 offerings.

          The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes:

          (1) To file, during any period in which offers or sales are being
made, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement:

              (i)    To include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of
                     the Securities Act of 1933;

              (ii)   To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising
                     after the effective date of the registration statement (or
                     the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which,
                     individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental
                     change in the information set forth in the registration
                     statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or
                     decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total
                     dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that
                     which was registered) and any deviation from the low or
                     high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be
                     reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the
                     Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)
                     if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price
                     represent no more than a 20% change in the maximum
                     aggregate offering price set forth in the "Calculation of
                     Registration Fee" table in the effective registration
                     statement; and

              (iii)  To include any material information with respect to the
                     plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the
                     registration statement or any material change to such
                     information in the registration statement.

          (2) That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the
Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be
a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona
fide offering thereof.

          (3) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment
any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of
the offering.
<PAGE>

     (b) The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that, for purposes of
determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each filing of our
annual report pursuant to Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (and, where applicable, each filing of an employee benefit
plan's annual report pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934) that is incorporated by reference in the registration statement shall be
deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered
therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be
the initial bona fide offering thereof.

     (c) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities
Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.
