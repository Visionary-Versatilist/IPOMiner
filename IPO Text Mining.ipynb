Unless the context otherwise requires, the\\nterms “Dropbox,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this prospectus refer to Dropbox, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and references to our “common stock” include our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock.DROPBOX, INC.Our BusinessOur modern economy runs on\\nknowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform where more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users\\nacross 180 countries.Dropbox was founded in 2007 with a simple idea: Life would be a lot better if everyone could access their most\\nimportant information anytime from any device. Over the past decade, we’ve largely accomplished that mission—but along the way we recognized that for most of our users, sharing and collaborating on Dropbox was even more valuable than\\nstoring files.Our market opportunity has grown as we’ve expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. Today,\\nDropbox is well positioned to reimagine the way work gets done. We’re focused on reducing the inordinate amount of time and energy the world wastes on “work about work”—tedious tasks like searching for content, switching between\\napplications, and managing workflows.We want to free up our users to spend more of their time on the work that truly matters. Our\\nmission is to unleash the world’s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.We believe the need for our\\nplatform will continue to grow as teams become more fluid and global, and content is increasingly fragmented across incompatible tools and devices. Dropbox breaks down silos by centralizing the flow of information between the products and services\\nour users prefer, even if they’re not our own.By solving these universal problems, we’ve become invaluable to our users. The\\npopularity of our platform drives viral growth, which has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently. We’ve built a thriving global business with over 11\\xa0million paying users.Our revenue was $603.8\\xa0million, $844.8\\xa0million, and $1,106.8 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, representing an annual\\ngrowth rate of 40% and 31%, respectively. We generated net losses of $325.9\\xa0million, $210.2\\xa0million, and $111.7 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. We also generated positive free cash flow of $137.4\\xa0million and $305.0\\nmillion in 2016 and 2017, respectively, compared to negative free cash flow of $63.9\\xa0million in 2015.1Table of ContentsOur UsersWe’re constantly inspired by the diverse ways people use Dropbox to bring their ideas to life and achieve their missions faster. Here are\\njust a few examples:•NobelPrize-winningresearchers sync data with collaborators to speed development of new scientific breakthroughs.•Designers for a sustainable apparel company iterate on new designs and coordinate store openings.•A commercial construction company shares blueprints with subcontractors on job sites and sends bids to prospective clients.•A Fortune 500 online travel company keeps its global workforce connected with business partners around the world.•Pro bono lawyers at a refugee assistance organization collect and share information across continents to save lives.What Sets Us ApartSince the beginning,\\nwe’ve focused on simplifying the lives of our users. In a world where business software can be frustrating to use, challenging to integrate, and expensive to sell, we take a different approach.Simple and intuitive designWhile traditional tools developed in the desktop age have struggled to keep up with evolving user demands, Dropbox was designed for the cloud\\nera. We build simple, beautiful products that bring joy to our users and make it easier for them to do their best work. Unencumbered by legacy features, we can perfect the aspects of our platform that matter most today, such as the mobile experience\\nand the ability to work in teams.Open ecosystemWe know people will continue to use a wide variety of tools and platforms. That’s why we’ve built Dropbox to work seamlessly with\\nother products, integrating with partners from Google and Microsoft to Slack and Autodesk. More than 75% of Dropbox Business teams have linked to one or more third-party applications.Viral,bottom-upadoptionOur 500\\xa0million registered users are our best salespeople. They’ve spread Dropbox to their friends and brought us into their offices.\\nEvery year, millions of individual users sign up for Dropbox at work.Bottom-upadoption within organizations has been critical to our success as users increasingly choose their own tools at work. We generate\\nover 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels—users who purchase a subscription through our app or website.Performance and\\nsecurityOur custom-built infrastructure allows us to maintain high standards of performance, availability, and security. Dropbox\\nis built on proprietary, block-level sync technology to achieve industry-leading performance. In 2016, IDC highlighted our sync performance asbest-in-class,outperforming competitors on multiple sync tests, including upload and download speeds for large files. We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. We also offer numerous\\nlayers of protection, from secure file data transfer and encryption to network configuration and application-level controls.2Table of ContentsIndustry Trends in Our FavorContent is increasingly scatteredThe proliferation of devices, operating systems, and applications has dramatically increased the volume and complexity of content in the\\nworkplace. Content is now routinely scattered across multiple silos, making it harder to access. According to a 2016 IDC report, more than half of companies ranging from 100 to 5,000+ employees use at least three repositories for accessing documents\\non a weekly basis.The tools people use are fragmentedContent created at work tends to follow a predictable pattern: It’s authored, sent out for feedback, and shared or published once\\nit’s done. At the same time, teams are organizing that content and coordinating tasks around it. But many of the tools people use today don’t work well together and support only one or two steps of the content lifecycle. This requires\\nusers to constantly switch between these tools and makes it even harder to get work done.Teams have become more fluid and globalTechnology hasn’t kept up with a modern workforce that’s increasingly fluid and mobile. People work together on teams\\nthat span different functions, organizations, and geographies. A 2016 study by Deloitte found that 37% of the global workforce is now mobile, 30% of full-time employees primarily work remotely, and 20% of the workforce is made up of temporary\\nworkers, contractors, and freelancers. The ability to swiftly disseminate content and its relevant context is critical to keeping teams in sync.“Work about work” is wasteful and stifles creativityThe combination of scattered content, fragmented tools, and fluid team structures has led to decreased workplace productivity. According to a\\nreport by McKinsey\\xa0& Company, knowledge workers spend approximately 60% of their time at work on tedious tasks such as searching for content, reviewing email, andre-sharingcontext to keep team\\nmembers in the loop—what we call “work about work.” This means they spend just 40% of their time doing the jobs they were hired to do.Individual users are changing the way software is adopted and purchasedSoftware purchasing decisions have traditionally been made by an organization’s IT department, which often deploys products that employees\\ndon’t like and many refuse to adopt. As individuals increasingly choose their own tools at work, purchasing power has become more decentralized. A 2017 IDC report noted that new devices and software were being adopted at a faster rate by\\nindividual users than by IT departments.Our SolutionDropbox allows individuals, teams, and organizations to collaborate more effectively. Anyone can sign up for free through our website or app,\\nand upgrade to a paid subscription plan for premium features. Our platform offers an elegant solution to the challenges described above.Key elements of our platform•Unified home for content.We provide a unified home for the world’s content and the relevant context\\naround it. To date, our users have added more than 400\\xa0billion pieces of content to Dropbox, totaling over an exabyte (more than 1,000,000,000 gigabytes) of data. When users join Dropbox, they gain3Table of Contentsaccess to a digital workspace that supports the full content lifecycle—they can create and organize their content, access it from anywhere, share it with internal and external collaborators,\\nand review feedback and history.•Global sharing network.We’ve built one of the largest collaboration platforms in the world, with more than 4.5\\xa0billion connections to shared content. We cater to the needs of dynamic, dispersed teams.\\nThe overwhelming majority of our customers use Dropbox to share and collaborate. As we continue to grow, more users benefit from frictionless sharing, and powerful network effects increase the utility and stickiness of our\\nplatform.•New product experiences.The insights we glean from our community of users lead us to develop new product experiences, like Paper, Smart Sync, and Showcase. Machine learning further improves the user experience\\nby enabling more intelligent search and better organization and utility of information. This ongoing innovation broadens the value of our platform and deepens user engagement.These elements reinforce one another to produce a powerful flywheel effect. As users create and share more content with more people, they\\nexpand our global sharing network. This network allows us to gather insights and feedback that help us create new product experiences. And with our scale, we can instantly put these innovations in the hands of millions. This, in turn, helps attract\\nmore users and content, which further propels the flywheel.Our Growth StrategyIncrease adoption and paid conversionWe designed Dropbox to be easy to try, use, and buy. Anyone can create an account and be up and running in minutes. We believe that our current\\nregistered user base represents a significant opportunity to increase our revenue. We estimate that approximately 300 million of our registered users have characteristics—including specific email domains, devices, and geographies—that make\\nthem more likely than other registered users to pay over time. Substantially all of our paying users share at least one of these characteristics. We reach our users throughin-productnotifications on our\\nwebsite and across hundreds of millions of actively connected devices without any external marketing spend. We define an actively connected device as a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet on which our app has been installed, and from which our app has\\nbeen launched, and made a request to our servers at least once in the most recent quarter.Upgrade our paying usersWe offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus and Professional for individuals, to Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise for teams. We\\nanalyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. For example, we prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our\\nStandard or Advanced plans for a better team experience. In 2017, over 40% of new Dropbox Business teams included a member who was previously a subscriber to one of our individual paid plans. We believe that a large majority of individual customers\\nuse Dropbox for work, which creates an opportunity to significantly increase conversion to Dropbox Business team offerings over time.Apply insights to build new product experiencesAs our community of users grows, we gain more insight into their needs and pain points. We translate these insights into new product\\nexperiences that support the entire content lifecycle. For example, we learned through analytics and research that our users often work with many different types of content. As a result, we added the ability to embed rich media in Paper so they can\\npull everything together in one place—from InVision graphics and Google slides to Spotify tracks and Vimeo clips.4Table of ContentsExpand our ecosystemOur open and thriving ecosystem fosters deeper relationships with our users and makes Dropbox more valuable to them over time. The scale and\\nreach of our platform is enhanced by a number of third-party applications, developers, and technology partners. As of December 31, 2017, Dropbox was receiving over 50\\xa0billion API calls per month, and more than 500,000 developers had registered\\nand built applications on our platform.Our Market OpportunityOver the past decade, Dropbox has pioneered the worldwide adoption of file sync and share software. We’ve since expanded our capabilities\\nand introduced new product experiences to help our users get work done. For the second consecutive year, Gartner has named Dropbox a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Content Collaboration Platforms.Our addressable market includes collaborative applications, content management, project and portfolio management, and public cloud storage.\\nIDC estimates that investment in these categories will total more than $50\\xa0billion in 2019.As one of the few large-scale\\ncollaboration platforms that serves customers of all sizes, we also have an opportunity to reach a broad population of independent knowledge and creative workers. We believe that this market hasn’t traditionally been included in IT spending\\nestimates.Risk Factors SummaryOur\\nbusiness is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:•Our business depends on our ability to retain and upgrade paying users, and any decline in renewals or upgrades could adversely affect our future results of operations.•Our future growth could be harmed if we fail to attract new users or convert registered users to paying users.•Our revenue growth rate has declined in recent periods and may continue to slow in the future.•We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.•Our business could be damaged, and we could be subject to liability if there is any unauthorized access to our data or our users’ content, including through privacy and data security breaches.•Our business could be harmed by any significant disruption of service on our platform or loss of content.•We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for content collaboration solutions in general could negatively impact our business.•Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control.•We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.•We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.5Table of Contents•We may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.•The multi-class structure of our common stock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, and it may depress the\\ntrading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock.Channels for Disclosure of InformationInvestors, the media, and others should note that, following the completion of this offering, we intend to announce material information to the\\npublic through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the investor relations page on our website, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts, our company news site at dropbox.com/news, and our corporate blog at\\nblogs.dropbox.com.The information disclosed by the foregoing channels could be deemed to be material information.

One person\\nwould count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one active license. For example, a 50-person Dropbox Business team would count as 50 paying users, and an individual Dropbox Plus user would count as one paying user. If that\\nindividual Dropbox Plus user was also part of the50-personDropbox Business team, we would count the individual as two paying users.The below table sets forth the number of paying users as of December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017:As of December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Paying users6.58.811.0Average revenue per paying userWe define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same\\nperiod. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on\\nadding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.The below table sets forth our ARPU for the years ended December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017.Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017ARPU$113.54$110.54$111.91Free cash flowWe define free cash flow, or FCF, as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.13Table of ContentsThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash\\nprovided by operating activities:Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$14.8$252.6$330.3Capital expenditures(78.7)(115.2)(25.3)Free cash flow$(63.9)$137.4$305.0See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations—Non-GAAPFinancial Measure” for additional information.14Table of ContentsRISK FACTORSInvesting in our Class\\xa0A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties\\ndescribed below, together with all of the other information in this prospectus, including the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial\\nstatements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class\\xa0A common stock. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to\\nus or that we currently believe are not material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business and Our\\nIndustryOur business depends on our ability to retain and upgrade paying users, and any decline in renewals or upgrades could adversely affect\\nour future results of operations.Our business depends upon our ability to maintain and expand our relationships with our users.\\nOur business is subscription based, and paying users are not obligated to and may not renew their subscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that paying users will renew their subscriptions\\nutilizing the same tier of our products or upgrade to premium offerings. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a user no longer having a\\nneed for our products, or the perception that competitive products provide better or less expensive options. In addition, some paying users downgrade or do not renew their subscriptions.We encourage paying users to upgrade to our premium offerings by recommending additional features and throughin-productprompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand within organizations through viral means by adding new users, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\\nDropbox into other departments within a workplace. We often see enterprise IT decision-makers deciding to adopt Dropbox after noticing substantial organic adoption by individuals and teams within the organization. If our paying users fail to renew\\nor cancel their subscriptions, or if we fail to upgrade our paying users to premium offerings or expand within organizations, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be harmed.Although it is important to our business that our users renew their subscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire and that we expand\\nour commercial relationships with our users, given the volume of our users, we do not track the retention rates of our individual users. As a result, we may be unable to address any retention issues with specific users in a timely manner, which\\ncould harm our business.Our future growth could be harmed if we fail to attract new users or convert registered users to paying users.We must continually add new users to grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace users who choose not to\\ncontinue to use our platform. Historically, our revenue has been driven by our self-serve model, and we generate more than 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. Any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support could harm our\\nbrand,word-of-mouthreferrals, and ability to grow.Additionally, many of our users initially access our platform free of charge. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform to our\\nregistered users, thereby encouraging them to convert to paying users throughin-productprompts and notifications, and time-limited trials of paid subscription plans. As of December 31, 2017, we served over\\n500\\xa0million registered users but only 11 million paying users. The actual number of unique users is lower than we report as one person may register more than once for our platform. As a result, we have fewer unique registered users that we may\\nbe able to convert to paying users. A majority of our registered users may never convert to a paid subscription to our platform.15Table of ContentsIn addition, our user growth rate may slow in the future as our market penetration rates\\nincrease and we turn our focus to converting registered users to paying users rather than growing the total number of registered users. If we are not able to continue to expand our user base or fail to convert our registered users to paying users,\\ndemand for our paid services and our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.Our revenue growth rate has declined in recent periods\\nand may continue to slow in the future.We have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. However, our rates of\\nrevenue growth are slowing and may continue to slow in the future. Many factors may contribute to declines in our growth rates, including higher market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our platform, a decrease in the growth of\\nthe overall content collaboration market, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an\\nindication of our future performance. If our growth rates decline, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock could be adversely affected.We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception. We incurred net losses of $325.9\\xa0million,\\n$210.2\\xa0million, and $111.7 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $1,049.7\\xa0million as of December 31, 2017. As we strive to grow our business, we expect expenses to increase in the near term,\\nparticularly as we continue to make investments to scale our business. For example, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy the needs of our user base. We also expect our research and development expenses\\nto increase as we plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product, and design teams to support these efforts. In addition, we will incur additional rent expense in connection with our move to our new corporate headquarters, and\\nadditional general and administrative expenses to support both our growth as well as our transition to being a publicly traded company. These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. We may encounter unforeseen or\\nunpredictable factors, including unforeseen operating expenses, complications, or delays, which may result in increased costs. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, user demand for our platform, user\\nadoption and renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive products and services. As a result, we may not achieve or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our\\nrevenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.Our business could be damaged, and we could be subject to liability if there is any unauthorized access to our data or our users’ content,\\nincluding through privacy and data security breaches.The use of our platform involves the transmission, storage, and processing\\nof user content, some of which may be considered personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive. We face security threats from malicious third parties that could obtain unauthorized access to our systems and networks. We anticipate that these\\nthreats will continue to grow in scope and complexity over time. For example, in 2016, we learned that an old set of Dropbox user credentials for approximately 68\\xa0million accounts was released. These credentials consisted of email addresses and\\npasswords protected by cryptographic techniques known as hashing and salting. Hashing and salting can make it more difficult to obtain the original password, but may not fully protect the original password from being obtained. We believe these\\nDropbox user credentials were obtained in 2012 and related to a security incident we disclosed to users. In response, we notified all existing users we believed to be affected and completed a password reset for anyone who had not updated their\\npassword sincemid-2012.We have responded to this event by expanding our security team and data monitoring capabilities and continuing to work on features such astwo-factorauthentication to increase protection of user information. While we believe our corrective actions will reduce the likelihood of similar incidents occurring in the future, third parties might use\\ntechniques16Table of Contentsthat we are unable to defend against to compromise and infiltrate our systems and networks. We may fail to detect the existence of a breach of user content and be unable to prevent unauthorized\\naccess to user and company content. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target. They may originate from less\\nregulated or remote areas around the world, or from state-sponsored actors. If our security measures are breached, or our users’ content is otherwise accessed through unauthorized means, or if any such actions are believed to occur, our\\nplatform may be perceived as insecure, and we may lose existing users or fail to attract and retain new users.We may rely on third\\nparties when deploying our infrastructure, and in doing so, expose it to security risks outside of our direct control. We rely on outside vendors and contractors to perform services necessary for the operation of the business, and they may fail to\\nadequately secure our user and company content.Third parties may attempt to compromise our employees and their privileged access into\\ninternal systems to gain access to accounts, our information, our networks, or our systems. Employee error, malfeasance, or other errors in the storage, use, or transmission of personal information could result in an actual or perceived breach of\\nuser privacy. Our users may also disclose or lose control of their passwords, or use the same or similar passwords on third parties’ systems, which could lead to unauthorized access to their accounts on our platform.Any unauthorized or inadvertent access to, or an actual or perceived security breach of, our systems or networks could result in an actual or\\nperceived loss of, or unauthorized access to, our data or our users’ content, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages, penalties, fines, and other costs in connection with actual and alleged contractual\\nbreaches, violations of applicable laws and regulations, and other liabilities. Any such incident could also materially damage our reputation and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including reducing our revenue,\\ncausing us to issue credits to users, negatively impacting our ability to accept and process user payment information, eroding our users’ trust in our services and payment solutions, subjecting us to costly user notification or remediation,\\nharming our ability to retain users, harming our brand, or increasing our cost of acquiring new users. We maintain errors, omissions, and cyber liability insurance policies covering certain security and privacy damages. However, we cannot be certain\\nthat our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another content\\ncollaboration solutions provider, our users and potential users could lose trust in the security of content collaboration solutions providers generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain users or attract new ones.Our business could be harmed by any significant disruption of service on our platform or loss of content.Our brand, reputation, and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users are dependent upon the reliable performance of our platform,\\nincluding our underlying technical infrastructure. Our users rely on our platform to store digital copies of their valuable content, including financial records, business information, documents, photos, and other important content. Our technical\\ninfrastructure may not be adequately designed with sufficient reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our platform is unavailable when users attempt to access it, or if it does not\\nload as quickly as they expect, users may not use our platform as often in the future, or at all.As our user base and the amount and\\ntypes of information stored, synced, and shared on our platform continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy the needs of our users. During\\n2015 and 2016, we migrated the vast majority of user content to our own custom-built infrastructure inco-locationfacilities that we directly lease and operate. As we add to our infrastructure, we may move or\\ntransfer additional content.Further, as we continue to grow and scale our business to meet the needs of our users, we may overestimate\\nor underestimate our infrastructure capacity requirements, which could adversely affect our results of operations.17Table of ContentsThe costs associated with leasing and maintaining our custom-built infrastructure inco-locationfacilities and third-party datacenters already constitute\\na significant portion of our capital and operating expenses. We continuously evaluate our short- and long-term infrastructure capacity requirements to ensure adequate capacity for new and existing users while minimizing unnecessary excess capacity\\ncosts. If we overestimate the demand for our platform and therefore secure excess infrastructure capacity, our operating margins could be reduced. If we underestimate our infrastructure capacity requirements, we may not be able to service the\\nexpanding needs of new and existing users, and our hosting facilities, network, or systems may fail.In addition, the datacenters that we\\nuse are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, intentional bad acts, earthquakes, floods, fires, war, terrorist attacks, power losses, hardware failures, systems failures, telecommunications failures, and similar events, any of which\\ncould disrupt our service, destroy user content, or prevent us from being able to continuously back up or record changes in our users’ content. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these datacenters, it may take a significant\\nperiod of time to achieve full resumption of our services, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Damage or interruptions to these datacenters could harm our platform and business.We generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for content collaboration solutions in\\ngeneral could negatively impact our business.We generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of\\nsubscriptions to our platform. As a result, widespread acceptance and use of content collaboration solutions in general, and our platform in particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the content collaboration market fails to grow\\nor grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.Changes in user preferences for\\ncontent collaboration may have a disproportionately greater impact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for content collaboration solutions in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of\\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:•awareness of the content collaboration category generally;•availability of products and services that compete with ours;•ease of adoption and use;•features and platform experience;•performance;•brand;•security and privacy;•customer support; and•pricing.The content collaboration market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and\\ntrends in preferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve more widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be\\nharmed.Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do\\nnot control.One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from18Table of Contentsdevices running Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, WindowsMobile, and Linux. We also have integrations with Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, Salesforce, Atlassian, Slack, IBM, Cisco, VMware, Okta, Symantec,\\nPalo Alto Networks, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We are dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control.\\nSeveral of our competitors own, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, third-party datacenter services, and other software, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or\\ndistribute operating systems, applications markets, third-party datacenter services, and other software that our platform requires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and services\\nthat more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business partners.Third-party services and\\nproducts are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors may be able to disrupt the operations or\\ncompatibility of our platform with their products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform. For example, we currently offer products that directly compete with\\nseveral large technology companies that we rely on to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products evolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors\\nmodify their products or standards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to competitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.We operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.The market for content collaboration platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain features of our platform compete in the cloud\\nstorage market with products offered by Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, and in the content collaboration market with products offered by Atlassian, Google, and Microsoft. We compete with Box on a more limited basis in the cloud storage market\\nfor deployments by large enterprises. We also compete with smaller private companies that offer point solutions in the cloud storage market or the content collaboration market. We believe the principal competitive factors in our markets include the\\nfollowing:•user-centric design;•ease of adoption and use;•scale of user network;•features and platform experience;•performance;•brand;•security and privacy;•accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;•third-party integration;•customer support;•continued innovation; and•pricing.With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition\\nto intensify in the future. Many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater19Table of Contentsname recognition, longer operating histories, more varied products and services, larger marketing budgets, more established marketing relationships, access to larger user bases, major\\ndistribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers, and greater financial, technical, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and\\nservices than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.Demand for our platform is also sensitive to price. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition and technology costs, and our\\ncurrent and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free products or services that compete with our\\nplatform or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and services. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire users at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced to\\nengage in price-cutting initiatives or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain users in response to competitive pressures, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and\\nfinancial condition.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.The content collaboration market is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions. Our ability\\nto grow our user base and increase revenue from existing users will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform, introduce new features and products, and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems,\\nand third-party applications. Users may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest significantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality and ease\\nof adoption and create organic user demand for our platform. For example, we recently introduced Paper, a new collaborative product experience, and Smart Sync, a new advanced productivity feature, to add additional functionality to our platform.\\nThere is no assurance that our enhancements to our platform or our new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate\\nuser demand, or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.The introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings\\ncould make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development,\\nintroduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features, or capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities, and there can be no assurance that new product\\nexperiences, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by users brought against us, all of which could have a material and adverse\\neffect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, new productivity features to our platform, such as Smart Sync, may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be\\nsuccessful. If users do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new features and capabilities to our\\nplatform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.Since our founding in 2007, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 1,446 employees as of December 31,\\n2015, to 1,858 employees as of December 31, 2017, with employees20Table of Contentslocated both in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous significant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources.\\nFurther growth of our operations to support our user base or our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we\\ncontinue to grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various countries around the world. Certain members of our management have not previously worked together for an extended period of\\ntime and some do not have experience managing a public company, which may affect how they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources.In addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our future results of operations\\nis subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in\\nrapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be\\nharmed.Our lack of a significant outbound sales force may limit the potential growth of our business.Historically, our business model has been driven by organic adoption and viral growth, with more than 90% of our revenue generated from\\nself-serve channels. As a result, we do not have a significant outbound sales force, which has enabled us to be more efficient with our sales and marketing spend. Although we believe our business model can continue to scale without a large outbound\\nsales force, ourword-of-mouthand user referral marketing model may not continue to be as successful as we anticipate, and our limited experience selling directly to\\nlarge organizations through our outbound sales force may impede our future growth. As we continue to scale our business, an enhanced sales infrastructure could assist in reaching larger organizations and growing our revenue. Identifying and\\nrecruiting additional qualified sales personnel and training them would require significant time, expense, and attention, and would significantly impact our business model. Further, adding more sales personnel would change our cost structure and\\nresults of operations, and we may have to reduce other expenses in order to accommodate a corresponding increase in sales and marketing expenses. If our limited experience selling and marketing to large organizations prevents us from reaching larger\\norganizations and growing our revenue, and if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel in the future, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.We may expand sales to large organizations, which could lengthen sales cycles and result in greater deployment challenges.As our business evolves, we may need to invest more resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations may undertake a\\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process, which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face unexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large organizations may demand more\\nconfiguration and integration of our platform or require additional security management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce\\nany sales. As a result, sales to large organizations may lead to greater unpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Any failure to offer high-quality customer support may harm our relationships with our users and our financial results.We have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no support necessary. Any increased user demand for customer support\\ncould increase costs and harm our results of operations. In addition, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide21Table of Contentsefficient customer support that meets our customers’ needs globally at scale. Paying users receive additional customer support features and the number of our paying users has grown\\nsignificantly, which will put additional pressure on our support organization. For example, the number of paying users has grown from 6.5\\xa0million as of December\\xa031, 2015, to 11 million as of December 31, 2017. If we are unable to provide\\nefficient customer support globally at scale, our ability to grow our operations may be harmed and we may need to hire additional support personnel, which could harm our results of operations. Our new user signups are highly dependent on our\\nbusiness reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing users. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could harm our reputation, business,\\nresults of operations, and financial condition.Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\\nperformance of our business.Our quarterly results of operations, including our revenue, gross margin, operating margin,\\nprofitability, cash flow from operations, and deferred revenue, may vary significantly in the future andperiod-to-periodcomparisons of our results of operations may\\nnot be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our\\ncontrol, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the value of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of\\noperations include, without limitation, those listed below:•our ability to retain and upgrade paying users;•our ability to attract new paying users and convert registered to paying users;•the timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure, as well as entry into operating and capital leases;•the timing of expenses related to acquisitions;•any large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;•the timing and success of new product feature and service introductions by us or our competitors;•network outages or actual or perceived security breaches;•changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;•changes in laws and regulations that impact our business; and•general economic and market conditions.Our results of operations may not immediately reflect downturns\\nor upturns in sales because we recognize revenue from our users over the term of their subscriptions with us.We recognize revenue\\nfrom subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Our subscription arrangements generally have monthly or annual contractual terms, and we also have a small percentage of multi-year contractual terms. Amounts that have been\\nbilled are initially recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue is recognized. As a result, a large portion of our revenue for each quarter reflects deferred revenue from subscriptions entered into during previous quarters, and downturns or\\nupturns in subscription sales, or renewals and potential changes in our pricing policies may not be reflected in our results of operations until later periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue\\nthrough additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from new users is recognized over the22Table of Contentsapplicable subscription term. By contrast, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, which occurs as soon as a user starts using our platform. As a result, an increase in\\nusers could result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier portion of the subscription term. We may not attain sufficient revenue to maintain positive cash flow from operations or achieve profitability in any given period.We depend on our key personnel and other highly qualified personnel, and if we fail to attract, integrate, and retain our personnel, and maintain our\\nunique corporate culture, our business could be harmed.We depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel.\\nIn particular, Andrew W. Houston, our President and Chief Executive Officer and one of ourco-founders,is critical to our vision, strategic direction, culture, and offerings. Some of our other key personnel\\nhave recently joined us and are still being integrated into our company. We may continue to make changes to our management team, which could make it difficult to execute on our business plans and strategies. New hires also require significant\\ntraining and, in most cases, take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our failure to successfully integrate these key personnel into our business could adversely affect our business.We do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our officers or key personnel. In addition, many of our key technologies and\\nsystems are custom-made for our business by our key personnel. The loss of key personnel, including key members of our management team, as well as certain of our key marketing, sales, product development, or technology personnel, could disrupt our\\noperations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.To execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly\\nqualified personnel. Competition for these employees is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where our headquarters are located, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel. We have from time to time\\nin the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as we expect, and we may\\nbe unable to hire, integrate, or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly\\nin the internet and high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity they are to receive in connection with their employment. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying\\ntheir equity incentive awards have significantly appreciated or significantly reduced in value. Many of our employees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets after this offering, which may reduce their\\nmotivation to continue to work for us. If we fail to attract new personnel, or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and growth prospects could be harmed.Additionally, if we do not maintain and continue to develop our corporate culture as we grow and evolve, it could harm our ability to foster\\nthe innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe that we need to support our growth. Additions of executive-level management and large numbers of employees could significantly and adversely impact our culture.Our business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our base of users will be\\nimpaired and our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed.We believe that our brand identity and\\nawareness have contributed to our success and have helped fuel our efficientgo-to-marketstrategy. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Dropbox brand is\\ncritical to expanding our base of users. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our\\nplatform or the providers of content collaboration solutions generally could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain users. Additionally, if we fail to promote and maintain23Table of Contentsthe Dropbox brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.We are continuing to expand our operations outside the United States, where we may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could impact\\nour results of operations.We have paying users across 180 countries and approximately half of our revenue in the year ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2017 was generated from paying users outside the United States. We expect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional\\nlanguages. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to sell subscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. For example, we may not be able to expand further in some markets if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and\\nindustry-specific requirements. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly\\ngrowing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. International expansion has required, and will continue to require, investment of\\nsignificant funds and other resources. Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:•recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;•providing our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among different cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they\\nare culturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;•compliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to our users\\nand individual members of management or employees if our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;•management of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention flexibility as does the United States;•operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United States;•compliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform\\nin certain international markets;•foreign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic territories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;•political and economic instability;•double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the income and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate; and•higher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs.Compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing business in international\\njurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as they change. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that\\nwe will always maintain compliance24Table of Contentsor that all of our employees, contractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or\\nreputational harm. If we are unable comply with these laws and regulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the\\nfuture.We conduct our business across 180 countries around the world. As we continue to expand our international operations, we\\nwill become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies and operating in foreign countries where the functional currency is the local currency. In 2017, 29% of\\nour sales were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our expenses, by contrast, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies could cause our\\nrevenue to decline relative to our costs, thereby decreasing our gross margins. Our results of operations are primarily subject to fluctuations in the euro and British pound sterling. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S.\\ndollars, but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could materially impact our\\nresults of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures tonon-U.S.dollar currencies.We depend on our infrastructure and third-party datacenters, and any disruption in the operation of these facilities or failure to renew the services\\ncould adversely affect our business.We host our services and serve all of our users using a combination of our own custom-built\\ninfrastructure that we lease and operate inco-locationfacilities and third-party datacenter services such as Amazon Web Services. While we typically control and have access to the servers we operate inco-locationfacilities and the components of our custom-built infrastructure that are located in thoseco-locationfacilities, we control neither the operation of these\\nfacilities nor our third-party service providers. Furthermore, we have no physical access or control over the services provided by Amazon Web Services.Datacenter leases and agreements with the providers of datacenter services expire at various times. The owners of these datacenters and\\nproviders of these datacenter services may have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Problems faced by datacenters, with our third-party datacenter service providers, with the\\ntelecommunications network providers with whom we or they contract, or with the systems by which our telecommunications providers allocate capacity among their users, including us, could adversely affect the experience of our users. Our third-party\\ndatacenter operators could decide to close their facilities or cease providing services without adequate notice. In addition, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by our third-party datacenters operators or any of the service\\nproviders with whom we or they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.If the datacenters and service providers that we use are unable to keep up with our growing needs for capacity, or if we are unable to renew\\nour agreements with datacenters, and service providers on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer servers or content to new datacenters or engage new service providers, and we may incur significant costs, and possible service\\ninterruption in connection with doing so. Any changes in third-party service levels at datacenters or any real or perceived errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our platform could harm our reputation and may result in\\ndamage to, or loss or compromise of, our users’ content. Interruptions in our platform might, among other things, reduce our revenue, cause us to issue refunds to users, subject us to potential liability, harm our reputation, or decrease our\\nrenewal rates.25Table of ContentsWe have relationships with third parties to provide, develop, and create applications that integrate\\nwith our platform, and our business could be harmed if we are not able to continue these relationships.We use software and\\nservices licensed and procured from third parties to develop and offer our platform. We may need to obtain future licenses and services from third parties to use intellectual property and technology associated with the development of our platform,\\nwhich might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software or services required for the development and maintenance of our platform could result in delays in the provision of our platform until\\nequivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available from others, is identified, obtained, and integrated, which could harm our platform and business. Any errors or defects in third-party software or services could result in errors or a\\nfailure of our platform, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We also depend on our ecosystem\\nof developers to create applications that will integrate with our platform. As of December 31, 2017, Dropbox was receiving over 50\\xa0billion API calls per month, and more than 500,000 developers had registered and built applications on our\\nplatform. Our reliance on this ecosystem of developers creates certain business risks relating to the quality of the applications built using our APIs, service interruptions of our platform from these applications, lack of service support for these\\napplications, and possession of intellectual property rights associated with these applications. We may not have the ability to control or prevent these risks. As a result, issues relating to these applications could adversely affect our business,\\nbrand, and reputation.We are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws that could subject us to claims, increase the cost of operations,\\nor otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws, changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with the laws.We are subject to compliance with various laws, including those covering copyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection,\\nand similar matters. There have been instances where improper or illegal content has been stored on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider, we do not regularly monitor our platform to evaluate the legality of content stored on it.\\nWhile to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as result of this content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the\\nfuture we and our competitors may be subject to legal actions, along with the users who uploaded such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating\\nextensive negative publicity about the content stored on our platform. Such publicity could harm our business and results of operations.We are also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact our sales and marketing efforts, including laws related to subscriptions,\\nbilling, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade paying users and attract new ones.Our platform depends on the ability of our users to access the internet and our platform has been blocked or restricted in some countries for\\nvarious reasons. For example, our platform is blocked in the People’s Republic of China. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law, or fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted\\nand we could be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.We are also subject to various U.S. and international\\nanti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees\\nand intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to officials and other recipients for improper purposes. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, our exposure for violating26Table of Contentsthese laws increases as we continue to expand our international presence and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our reputation and our business.We are subject to export and import control laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to\\nliability if we violate such laws and regulations.We are subject to U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations that prohibit\\nthe shipment or provision of certain products and services to certain countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we take precautions to prevent our products and services from being exported in violation of these laws,\\nincluding implementing IP address blocking, we cannot guarantee that the precautions we take will prevent violations of export control and sanctions laws. For example, in 2011, we provided certain downloadable portions of our software to\\ninternational users that, prior to export, required either aone-timeproduct review or application for an encryption registration number in lieu of such product review. These exports were likely made in\\nviolation of U.S. export control and sanction laws. In March 2011, we filed a Final Voluntary Self Disclosure with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, concerning these potential violations. In June 2012,\\nBIS notified us that it had completed its review of these matters and closed its review with the issuance of a Warning Letter. No monetary penalties were assessed against us by BIS with respect to the 2011 filing. In addition, in 2017, we discovered\\nthat our platform has been accessed by certain users in apparent violation of United States sanctions regulations. We filed an Initial Voluntary Self Disclosure in October 2017 with the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and a Final\\nVoluntary Self Disclosure with OFAC in February 2018. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in substantial fines and penalties for us and for the individuals working for us.In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export\\npermitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our users’ ability to access our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform or client-side software,\\nor future changes in export and import regulations may prevent our users with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons\\naltogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in\\nour decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential users with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely\\naffect our business, results of operations, and financial results.Our actual or perceived failure to comply with privacy, data protection, and\\ninformation security laws, regulations, and obligations could harm our business.We receive, store, process, and use personal\\ninformation and other user content. There are numerous federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security, and the storing, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and\\nprotection of personal information and other content, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy\\npolicies and obligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. We strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and\\ninformation security to the extent possible. However, the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged\\nobligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices.We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and\\ninformation security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example,27Table of ContentsEuropean legislators have adopted a General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that will, when effective in May 2018, supersede current European Union, or EU, data protection legislation,\\nimpose more stringent EU data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. Further, following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom approved an exit from the EU, the United Kingdom\\ngovernment has initiated a process to leave the EU, or Brexit. Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the United Kingdom. In particular, it is unclear whether the United Kingdom will enact data protection\\nlaws or regulations designed to be consistent with the pending EU General Data Protection Regulation and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated. Additionally, although we have self-certified under theU.S.-EUand U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks with regard to our transfer of certain personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, some regulatory uncertainty remains surrounding the future of\\ndata transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the United States, and we are closely monitoring regulatory developments in this area.Any\\nfailure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any of our other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may result\\nin governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability or cause our users to lose trust in us, which could have an\\nadverse effect on our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our users may limit the adoption and use of, and\\nreduce the overall demand for, our services.Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors or developers, violate\\napplicable laws or regulations or our policies, such violations may also put our users’ content at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices\\nregarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or disclosure of such content is obtained,\\ncould increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may limit our ability to store and process user data or develop new services and features.Our business could be adversely impacted by changes in internet access for our users or laws specifically governing the internet.Our platform depends on the quality of our users’ access to the internet. Certain features of our platform require significant bandwidth\\nand fidelity to work effectively. Internet access is frequently provided by companies that have significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to our platform, which would negatively impact\\nour business. We could incur greater operating expenses and our user acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted if network operators:•implement usage-based pricing;•discount pricing for competitive products;•otherwise materially change their pricing rates or schemes;•charge us to deliver our traffic at certain levels or at all;•throttle traffic based on its source or type;•implement bandwidth caps or other usage restrictions; or•otherwise try to monetize or control access to their networks.On December 14, 2017, the\\nFederal Communications Commission voted to repeal the “net neutrality” rules and return to a “light-touch” regulatory framework. However, the repeal has not yet taken effect and a number of parties have already stated their\\nintent to appeal this order; thus, the future impact of such repeal and any28Table of Contentschallenge thereto remains uncertain. The rules were designed to ensure that all online content is treated the same by internet service providers and other companies that provide broadband\\nservices. Should the repeal of net neutrality rules take effect, we could incur greater operating expenses, which could harm our results of operations.As the internet continues to experience growth in the number of users, frequency of use, and amount of data transmitted, the internet\\ninfrastructure that we and our users rely on may be unable to support the demands placed upon it. The failure of the internet infrastructure that we or our users rely on, even for a short period of time, could undermine our operations and harm our\\nresults of operations.In addition, there are various laws and regulations that could impede the growth of the internet or other online\\nservices, and new laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. These laws and regulations could, in addition to limiting internet neutrality, involve taxation, tariffs, privacy, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic\\ncontracts and other communications, consumer protection, and the characteristics and quality of services, any of which could decrease the demand for, or the usage of, our platform. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or\\ninterpret and apply existing laws, in ways that require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could materially harm our\\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition.We are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims\\nand other litigation matters and, if resolved adversely, they could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We own a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and, from time to time, are subject to litigation\\nbased on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property, or other rights. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims\\nagainst us grows. From time to time, we are party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property and our platform. The costs of supporting litigation and dispute resolution proceedings are considerable, and there can be no\\nassurances that a favorable outcome will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of any\\nsettlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in\\nviolation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at all, and we may be required to develop\\nalternativenon-infringingtechnology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative,non-infringingtechnology or practices could require\\nsignificant effort and expense. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected as a result.Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets.We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret, and domain name protection, trademark, and\\ncopyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In the United States and abroad, we have over 600 issued patents and\\nmore than 600 pending patent applications. However, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge our proprietary rights, pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications may\\nnot be approved, and we may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our\\nproprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of29Table of Contentsconfidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade\\nsecrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further, laws in certain jurisdictions may afford little or no trade secret protection, and any changes in, or unexpected\\ninterpretations of, the intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope\\nof our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to\\nmore effectively replicate our platform and its features. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our use of open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to our platform and subject us to possible\\nlitigation.A portion of the technologies we use incorporates open source software, and we may incorporate open source software in\\nthe future. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. These licenses may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions, including requirements that we offer our platform that\\nincorporates the open source software for no cost, that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, and/or that we license such modifications or\\nderivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose any of\\nour source code that incorporates or is a modification of our licensed software. If an author or other third party that distributes open source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the\\napplicable license, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against those allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from offering or selling our solutions that contained the open source software,\\nand required to comply with the foregoing conditions. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors in our platform.The software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first\\nintroduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from time to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new software may be detected in the future by us or our users.\\nThere can be no assurance that our existing platform and new software will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity or lead to data security, access,\\nretention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in correcting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the harm to our\\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our platform. Any defects in, or\\nunavailability of, our or third-party software, services, or hardware that cause interruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:•cause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;•require us to issue refunds to our users or expose us to claims for damages;•cause us to lose existing users and make it more difficult to attract new users;•divert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase our expenses;30Table of Contents•increase our technical support costs; and•harm our reputation and brand.We may acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which\\ncould require significant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.Part of our business strategy\\nis to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We have limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at\\nall. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to\\nintegrate acquired businesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our\\ncompany, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process will require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management, and disrupt the ordinary functioning of our\\nbusiness, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and\\naccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.We may have to pay cash, incur\\ndebt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders.\\nIf we incur more debt, it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to flexibly operate our business.Our business may be significantly impacted by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or business spending.Our business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including any resulting effect on spending by our business and consumer\\nusers. Some of our users may view a subscription to our platform as a discretionary purchase, and our paying users may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform during an economic downturn. If an economic downturn were to occur, we may\\nexperience such a reduction in the future, especially in the event of a prolonged recessionary period. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be significantly affected by changes in the economy generally.Our business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.Occurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications\\nfailure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and some of the datacenters we utilize are located in the San Francisco\\nBay Area, a region known for seismic activity, and our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other significant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to\\nthe internet or the economy as a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. If our systems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to deliver\\nproducts to our users would be impaired or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop adequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster, and successfully execute on those plans in the\\nevent of a disaster or emergency, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation would be harmed.31Table of ContentsWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could adversely impact our\\nresults of operations.While to date we have not incurred significant income taxes in operating our business, we are subject to\\nincome taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could\\nalso be impacted by changes innon-deductibleexpenses, changes in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize\\nthem, the applicability of withholding taxes and effects from acquisitions.Our tax provision could also be impacted by changes in\\naccounting principles, changes in U.S. federal, state, or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as the recent legislation enacted in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, other fundamental law changes\\ncurrently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. Additionally, in October 2015, the Organization for EconomicCo-Operationand Development released final guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing,country-by-countryreporting, and definitional changes to permanent establishment that could ultimately impact our tax liabilities.We are subject to review\\nand audit by U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we take and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our financial results and operations\\ncould be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes innon-incomebased taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, or international tax laws,\\nchanges in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, changes to the business operations, including\\nacquisitions, as well as the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.Our ability to use\\nour net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.As of December\\xa031, 2017, we had\\n$312.2\\xa0million of federal and $143.0\\xa0million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2031 for federal and 2030 for state tax purposes. As of December\\xa031, 2017,\\nwe also had $289.3\\xa0million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, we had $22.9 million of foreign acquired net operating losses, which will\\ncarryforward indefinitely. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration or at all. Under Sections\\xa0382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\\namended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use itspre-changenet operating loss carryforwards and otherpre-changeattributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by“5-percentshareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We performed a study for the period through December 31, 2017, and\\ndetermined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points had occurred. Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of\\nownership changes from January 1, 2018, and subsequent years or as a result of this offering.Our operating results may be harmed if we are\\nrequired to collect sales or other related taxes for our subscription services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.We collect sales and value-added tax as part of our subscription agreements in a number of jurisdictions. One or more states or countries may\\nseek to impose incremental or new sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us or our resellers and other partners. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other jurisdiction that we should have been\\nor should be collecting additional sales, use, or other32Table of Contentstaxes on our services could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage users from purchasing our\\nplatform, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our results of operations and financial condition could\\nbe materially affected by the enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies.On December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, was enacted, which contains\\nsignificant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a transition to a new territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of the new legislation on our provision for income taxes was a\\nreduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in the corporate tax rate. However, since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, we do not currently anticipate that\\nthese changes will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the Tax Reform Act will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which we will continue to monitor and assess.\\nProvisional accounting impacts may change in future reporting periods until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than one year from the date the Tax Reform Act was enacted. As we expand the scale of our international\\nbusiness activities, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and\\naccurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.As a public company, we will be subject to\\nthe reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq Global\\nSelect Market, or Nasdaq. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place\\nsignificant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain\\neffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by\\nus in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated\\nand communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and\\ninternal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further,\\nweaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could\\nharm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial\\nreporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we\\nwill eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure33Table of Contentscontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a\\nnegative effect on the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules\\nthat implement Section\\xa0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we will be required to\\nprovide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form10-K.Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over\\nfinancial reporting until our first annual report filed with the SEC where we are an “accelerated filer” or a “large accelerated filer”. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is\\nadverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting\\ncould materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause a decline in the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock.Although we ceased to be an “emerging growth company,” we can continue to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements in this\\nregistration statement, which may make our Class\\xa0A common stock less attractive to investors.We ceased to be an\\n“emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, on December\\xa031, 2017. However, because we ceased to be an “emerging growth company” after we confidentially submitted\\nour registration statement related to this offering to the SEC, we will continue to be treated as an “emerging growth company” for certain purposes until the earlier of the date on which we complete this offering or December 31, 2018. As\\nsuch, we have taken advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations regarding selected financial data and executive compensation arrangements in our registration statement related to this offering that are not available to non-emerging growth\\ncompanies. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class\\xa0A common stock less attractive because we have relied on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class\\xa0A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be less demand\\nfor our Class\\xa0A common stock and the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\\xa0A common stock may decrease.Our reported\\nresults of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or\\nFASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations, and may even affect the\\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU,No.\\xa02014-09,Revenue from\\nContracts with Customers (Topic 606), or Topic 606, which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. We adopted the requirements of Topic 606 as of January\\xa01, 2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. As\\nsuch, Topic 606 is reflected in our financial results for all periods presented in this prospectus. The adoption of Topic 606 primarily resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition and deferred commissions, which we believe\\nto be critical accounting policies. While the impact of adopting Topic 606 on our revenue was not material, it is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively\\naffect our results of operations.34Table of ContentsWe recently implemented a new enterprise resource planning system, and if this new system proves\\nineffective or if we experience issues with the transition, we may be unable to timely or accurately prepare financial reports, make payments to our suppliers and employees, or invoice and collect from our users.In 2017, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system, including our systems for tracking revenue recognition. Our ERP\\nsystem is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records and to prepare our financial statements. The transition to our new ERP system may be disruptive to our business if the ERP system does not work as planned or if we experience\\nissues relating to the implementation. Such disruptions could impact our ability to timely or accurately make payments to our suppliers and employees, and could also inhibit our ability to invoice, and collect from our users. Data integrity problems\\nor other issues may be discovered which, if not corrected, could impact our business or financial results. In addition, we may experience periodic or prolonged disruption of our financial functions arising out of this conversion, general use of such\\nsystem, other periodic upgrades or updates, or other external factors that are outside of our control. If we encounter unforeseen problems with our ERP system or other related systems and infrastructure, our business, results of operations, and\\nfinancial condition could be adversely affected.Certain of our market opportunity estimates, growth forecasts, and key metrics included in this\\nprospectus could prove to be inaccurate, and any real or perceived inaccuracies may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may\\nnot prove to be accurate. The estimates and forecasts in this prospectus relating to the size and expected growth of our target market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasted\\nin this prospectus, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. We also rely on assumptions and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, such as paying users, average revenue per paying user, and free cash flow. We\\nregularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating our key metrics to improve their accuracy. Our key metrics may differ from estimates published by third parties or from similarly titled metrics of our competitors due to differences in\\nmethodology. We have found that aggregate user activity metrics are not leading indicators of revenue or conversion. For that reason, we do not comprehensively track user activity across the Dropbox platform for financial planning and forecasting\\npurposes. If investors or analysts do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our business, or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition would be\\nharmed.Our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our intellectual property and\\ncertain other assets, and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.We are party to a revolving credit and guarantee agreement, as amended, which contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, create liens, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or\\nconsolidate with other companies, or sell substantially all of our assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity balance. The terms of our revolving\\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies. In addition, complying with these covenants may make\\nit more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions.A failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement, as amended, could result in an event\\nof default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all35Table of Contentsborrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral we\\ngranted to them, which consists of substantially all our intellectual property and certain other assets. If the debt under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may\\nnot be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.Our operations may be interrupted and our business, results of\\noperations, and financial condition could be adversely affected if we default on our leasing or credit obligations.We finance a\\nsignificant portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements, some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet, and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future. As of December\\xa031, 2017, we had an\\naggregate of $1,687.0\\xa0million of commitments to settle contractual obligations. In particular, we have used these types of arrangements to finance some of our equipment and datacenters. In addition, we may draw upon our revolving credit\\nfacility to finance our operations or for other corporate purposes, such as funding our tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units, or RSUs. If we default on these leasing or credit\\nobligations, our leasing partners and lenders may, among other things:•require repayment of any outstanding lease obligations;•terminate our leasing arrangements;•terminate our access to the leased datacenters we utilize;•stop delivery of ordered equipment;•sell or require us to return our leased equipment;•require repayment of any outstanding amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility;•terminate our revolving credit facility; or•require us to pay significant fees, penalties, or damages.In October 2017, we entered into a\\nnew lease agreement to rent office space in San Francisco, California, to serve as our new corporate headquarters. The total minimum obligations under this lease agreement are expected to be approximately $827.0 million. Before moving to our new\\ncorporate headquarters, we will continue to operate in our current corporate headquarters, during which time we will be incurring rent expense on both our current and new corporate headquarters. After moving to our new corporate headquarters, we\\nplan to vacate our current corporate headquarters with the intention of subleasing the space to a third-party for the remainder of the lease term, which terminates in the third quarter of 2027. If we are unable to find sublessors for all or a\\nportion of our current corporate headquarters, our results of operations will be adversely impacted as a result of this additional rent expense through 2027.If some or all of these events were to occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well\\nas our business, results of operations, and financial condition, could be adversely affected.We may need additional capital, and we cannot be\\ncertain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all.Historically, we have funded our operations and\\ncapital expenditures primarily through equity issuances, cash generated from our operations, and debt financing for capital purchases. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, amounts available under our existing\\ncredit facilities, and cash flow36Table of Contentsfrom operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require additional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability\\nto obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class\\xa0A Common StockAn active trading market for our Class\\xa0A common stock may never develop or be sustained.We have applied to list our Class\\xa0A common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol “DBX”. However, we cannot assure you that an active\\ntrading market for our Class\\xa0A common stock will develop on that exchange or elsewhere or, if developed, that any market will be sustained. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of the likelihood that an active trading market for our Class\\xa0A\\ncommon stock will develop or be maintained, the liquidity of any trading market, your ability to sell your shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock when desired or the prices that you may obtain for your shares.The trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock. The initial public offering price of our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock was determined through negotiation among us, the selling stockholders, and the underwriters. This price does not necessarily reflect the price at which investors in the market will be willing to buy and sell shares of our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock following this offering. In addition, the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock following this offering is likely to be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which\\nare beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class\\xa0A common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid in this offering. Factors that could\\ncause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock include the following:•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;•volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;•sales of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock by us or our stockholders;•failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;•the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;•rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;•actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;•actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses or the competitive landscape generally;37Table of Contents•litigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;•developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;•announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;•new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;•any significant change in our management; and•general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.In addition, in the\\npast, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against\\nus, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.The multi-class structure of our common\\nstock will have the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of this offering, and it may depress the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock.Our Class\\xa0A common stock, which is the stock we are offering in this offering, has one vote per share, our Class\\xa0B common stock has\\nten votes per share, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Following this offering, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, and their respective affiliates,\\nwill hold in the aggregate \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the voting power of our capital stock (including the Co-Founder Grants). We are including the Co-Founder Grants in this calculation since our co-founders are able to vote these shares\\nimmediately upon grant and prior to their vesting. Because of theten-to-onevoting ratio between our Class\\xa0B and Class\\xa0A common stock, the holders of our\\nClass\\xa0B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This concentrated control will limit\\nor preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or\\nother major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.Future transfers by holders of Class\\xa0B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class\\xa0A common stock,\\nsubject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes and transfers between our co-founders. The conversion of Class\\xa0B common stock to Class\\xa0A common stock will have the effect, over time, of\\nincreasing the relative voting power of those individual holders of Class\\xa0B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. In addition, because our Class C common stock carries no voting rights (except as otherwise required by law), if\\nwe issue Class C common stock in the future, the holders of Class B common stock may be able to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders for a longer period of time than would be\\nthe case if we issued Class A common stock rather than Class C common stock in such transactions. See the section titled “Description of Capital Stock—Anti-Takeover Provisions” for additional information.In addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard\\xa0& Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly public\\ncompanies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which38Table of Contentstogether make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our multi-class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices, and as a result,\\nmutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies are very new and it is as of yet unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the\\nvaluations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companies that are included.A substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock after this offering will be restricted\\nfrom immediate resale, but may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future. The large number of shares of our capital stock eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price\\nof our Class\\xa0A common stock.The market price of our Class\\xa0A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large\\nnumber of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock in the market after this offering, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class\\xa0A common stock. Based on 17,727,212 shares of our Class\\xa0A\\ncommon stock (including the Capital Stock Conversions) and 522,752,944 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock (including the Capital Stock Conversions and the RSU Settlement) outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2017, we will have\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares Class\\xa0B common stock outstanding after this\\noffering. Our executive officers, directors, and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us or have entered or will\\nenter intolock-upagreements with the underwriters under which they have agreed or will agree, subject to specific exceptions, not to sell any of our stock for 180 days following the date of this prospectus.\\nWe refer to such period as thelock-upperiod. Pursuant to the lock-up agreements with the underwriters, if (i) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (ii) we have publicly released\\nour earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (iii) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a broadly applicable period during which trading in our securities would\\nnot be permitted under our insider trading policy, or a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. We and the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market\\nstandoff agreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up period.As a result of these agreements and the provisions of\\nour investors’ rights agreement described further in the section titled “Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights,” and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and\\nClass\\xa0B common stock will be available for sale in the public market as follows:•beginning on the date of this prospectus, all shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market; and•beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus (subject to the terms of the lock-up agreements and market standoff agreements described above), the remainder of the shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and\\nClass\\xa0B common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter, subject in some cases to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below.Upon completion of this offering, stockholders owning an aggregate of up to 220,965,979 shares of our Class B common stock and 387,934 shares\\nof our Class A common stock will be entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States. In addition, we intend to file a registration statement to register shares\\nreserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Upon effectiveness of that registration statement, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and the expiration or waiver of the market standoff agreements andlock-upagreements referred to above, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open\\nmarket.39Table of ContentsSales of our shares as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more\\ndifficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause the trading price of our Class\\xa0A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of\\nour Class\\xa0A common stock.If you purchase our Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution.The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our outstanding\\ncommon stock of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share as of December\\xa031, 2017. Investors purchasing shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the book\\nvalue of our tangible assets after subtracting our liabilities. As a result, investors purchasing Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering will incur immediate dilution of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, based on the\\nassumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.This dilution is due to the substantially lower price paid by our investors who purchased shares prior to this offering as compared to the\\nprice offered to the public in this offering, and any previous exercise of stock options granted to our service providers. In addition, as of December\\xa031, 2017, options to purchase 7,439,253 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock with a\\nweighted-average exercise price of approximately $7.01 per share were outstanding as well as 25,061,536 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and 57,329,003 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock subject to RSUs. The exercise of any of these\\noptions and settlement of any of these RSUs would result in additional dilution. Our Board of Directors has approved the acceleration of the Performance Vesting Condition for 39,088,766 RSUs (which are included in the 57,329,003 shares of our Class\\nB common stock subject to RSUs referenced above) for which the service condition was satisfied as of December\\xa031, 2017, to occur upon the effectiveness of our registration statement related to this offering, which will result in the net\\nissuance of 23,844,147 shares of our Class B common stock upon the RSU Settlement. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing shares in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering, if anything, in\\nthe event of our liquidation.We have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering and we may not use them effectively.We cannot specify with any certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering. Our\\nmanagement will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering, including for any of the purposes described in “Use of Proceeds,” and you will not have the opportunity as part of your investment decision to\\nassess whether the net proceeds are being used appropriately. Because of the number and variability of factors that will determine our use of the net proceeds from this offering, their ultimate use may vary substantially from their currently\\nintended use. The failure by our management to apply these proceeds effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Pending their use, we may invest our proceeds in a manner that does not produce\\nincome or that loses value. Our investments may not yield a favorable return to our investors and may negatively impact the price of our Class\\xa0A common stock.Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest\\ndifficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class\\xa0A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the\\nanti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the\\nperson becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of\\nour company more difficult, including the following:•any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;40Table of Contents•our multi-class common stock structure, which provides our holders of Class B common stock with the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class\\xa0A common stock, Class\\xa0B common stock, and Class C common stock;•our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;•certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or restated bylaws will require the approval of 80% of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B\\ncommon stock;•our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent; and•vacancies on our Board of Directors will be able to be filled only by our Board of Directors and not by stockholders;•only our chairman of the Board of Directors, chief executive officer, or a majority of Board of Directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;•our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued, without the approval of the holders of Class\\xa0A common\\nstock; and•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions\\ncould also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity\\nfor our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class\\xa0A common stock.Our amended and restated bylaws will designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially\\nall disputes between us and our stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, each of which could limit our\\nstockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.Our amended\\nand restated bylaws, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative\\naction or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the\\nDelaware General Corporation Law, or the certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the\\nState of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court’s having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants.Our\\namended and restated bylaws will also provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.41Table of ContentsAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our Class A\\ncommon stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors,\\nofficers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable\\nin an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could harm our results of operations.Affiliates of two of the underwriters in this offering will receive at least 5% of the net proceeds of this offering and have an interest in this\\noffering beyond customary underwriting discounts and commissions.Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are\\nunderwriters in this offering and their affiliates will receive at least 5% of the net proceeds of this offering in connection with our repayment of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 that is expected to be\\noutstanding under our revolving credit facility immediately prior to the completion of this offering. As such, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC are each deemed to have a “conflict of interest” under Rule 5121 of\\nthe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc., or Rule 5121. Accordingly, this offering will be made in compliance with the applicable provisions of Rule 5121. This rule requires, among other things, that a “qualified independent\\nunderwriter” has participated in the preparation of, and has exercised the usual standards of “due diligence” with respect to, the registration statement. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 has\\nagreed to act as qualified independent underwriter for this offering and to undertake the legal responsibilities and liabilities of an underwriter under the Securities Act. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nwill not receive any additional fees for serving as qualified independent underwriter in connection with this offering. Although \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 has, in its capacity as qualified independent\\nunderwriter, participated in due diligence and the preparation of this prospectus and the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, we cannot assure you that this will adequately address all potential conflicts of interest. We\\nhave agreed to indemnify \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 against liabilities incurred in connection with acting as qualified independent underwriter, including liabilities under the Securities Act. Pursuant\\nto FINRA Rule 5121, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC will not confirm sales of securities to any account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior written approval of the customer. See\\n“Underwriting (Conflicts of Interest)” for additional information.Our Class\\xa0A common stock market price and trading volume could\\ndecline if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.The trading market for our Class\\xa0A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts\\npublish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class\\xa0A common stock or\\npublish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports\\non us regularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class\\xa0A common stock to decline.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation\\nand expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\\xa0A common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any\\nfuture gains on their investment. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.42Table of ContentsSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis prospectus contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements involve substantial\\nrisks and uncertainties.

If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock from\\nus is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us would be approximately $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by\\nus. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering by the selling stockholders.Each\\n$1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would\\nincrease or decrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains\\nthe same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. Similarly, each increase or decrease of 1.0\\xa0million in the number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock offered by us would increase or\\ndecrease the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, assuming the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting\\ndiscounts and commissions payable by us.The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial\\nflexibility, create a public market for our Class\\xa0A common stock, and enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders.We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to repay $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 that\\nis expected to be outstanding immediately prior to the completion of this offering under our revolving credit facility, which we intend to draw down prior to the completion of this offering to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations of\\n$\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 related to the RSU Settlement. This amount is based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the\\nestimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus. See the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for\\nadditional information regarding our revolving credit facility.We also intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for\\ngeneral corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to acquire businesses, products, services, or technologies.\\nHowever, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this time. We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad\\ndiscretion in using these proceeds. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we may invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments.46Table of ContentsDIVIDEND POLICYWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to\\npay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility place certain\\nlimitations on the amount of cash dividends we can pay, even if no amounts are currently outstanding.47Table of ContentsCAPITALIZATIONThe following table sets forth cash and cash equivalents, as well as our capitalization, as of December\\xa031, 2017, as follows:•on an actual basis;•on a pro forma basis, giving effect to (i)\\xa0the Capital Stock Conversions, as if such conversions had occurred on December\\xa031, 2017, (ii) the filing and effectiveness of our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation in Delaware that will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, (iii)\\xa0stock-based compensation expense of $415.6\\xa0million associated with the RSU Settlement, (iv)\\xa0the net issuance of\\n23,844,147 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock upon the RSU Settlement, (v)\\xa0the borrowing of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the RSU\\nSettlement, and (vi)\\xa0a cash payment of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 to satisfy our tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the RSU Settlement, which amounts in (v)\\xa0and (vi) are\\nbased upon the assumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus; and•on a pro forma as adjusted basis, giving effect to (i)\\xa0the pro forma adjustments set forth above, (ii)\\xa0the sale and issuance by us of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nshares of our Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering, based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this\\nprospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, (iii)\\xa0the conversion of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our\\nClass\\xa0B common stock held by certain selling stockholders into an equivalent number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock upon the sale by the selling stockholders in this offering, and (iv)\\xa0the use of proceeds from the offering to\\nrepay $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 drawn down under our revolving credit facility to satisfy our tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the RSU Settlement.48Table of ContentsThe pro forma as adjusted information set forth in the table below is illustrative only and\\nwill be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing.

Net tangible book value dilution per share to\\nnew investors represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after\\ncompletion of this offering.Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets less our total\\nliabilities by the number of shares of our common stock outstanding. Our historical net tangible book value as of December\\xa031, 2017, was $(13.0)\\xa0million, or $(0.04) per share. Our pro forma net tangible book value as of December\\xa031,\\n2017, was $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0million, or $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, based on the total number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock outstanding\\nas of December\\xa031, 2017, after giving effect to the Capital Stock Conversions and the RSU Settlement.After giving effect to the\\nsale by us of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock in this offering at the assumed initial public offering price of\\n$\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and\\ncommissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of December\\xa031, 2017, would have been $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, or\\n$\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 per share.

This discussion\\ncontains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those\\nidentified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this prospectus.Our BusinessOur modern economy runs on knowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform\\nwhere more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users across 180 countries.Dropbox was founded in 2007 with a simple idea: Life would be a lot better if everyone could access their most important information anytime\\nfrom any device. Over the past decade, we’ve largely accomplished that mission—but along the way we recognized that for most of our users, sharing and collaborating on Dropbox was even more valuable than storing files.Our market opportunity has grown as we’ve expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. Today, Dropbox is well positioned\\nto reimagine the way work gets done. We’re focused on reducing the inordinate amount of time and energy the world wastes on “work about work”—tedious tasks like searching for content, switching between applications, and managing\\nworkflows.We’ve built a thriving global business with 11\\xa0million paying users. Our revenue was $603.8\\xa0million,\\n$844.8\\xa0million, and $1,106.8 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, representing an annual growth rate of 40% and 31%, respectively. We generated net losses of $325.9\\xa0million, $210.2\\xa0million, and $111.7 million in 2015, 2016,\\nand 2017, respectively. We also generated positive free cash flow of $137.4\\xa0million and $305.0\\xa0million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, compared to negative free cash flow of $63.9\\xa0million in 2015.57Table of ContentsOur HistorySince our founding, we’ve built one of the largest collaboration platforms in the world.Our Subscription PlansWe generate revenue from individuals, teams, and organizations by selling subscriptions to our platform, which serve the varying needs of our\\ndiverse customer base. Of our 11 million paying users, approximately 30% use Dropbox for work on a Dropbox Business team plan, and we estimate that an additional 50% use Dropbox58Table of Contentsfor work on an individual plan, collectively totaling approximately 80% of paying users. As of December\\xa031, 2017, approximately 92% of Fortune 500 companies had paying Dropbox users within\\ntheir organization, and approximately 56% had at least one paying Dropbox Business team. We had more than 300,000 paying Dropbox Business teams as of December\\xa031, 2017. Each Dropbox Business team represents a separately billed deployment that\\nis managed through a single administrative dashboard. Each team must have a minimum of three users, but we also serve teams that can have more than tens of thousands of users. Customers can choose between an annual or monthly plan, with a small\\nnumber of large organizations on multi-year plans. A majority of our customers opt for our annual plans. We typically bill our customers at the beginning of their respective terms and recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription\\nperiod. International customers can pay in U.S. dollars or a select number of foreign currencies.Individuals Dropbox Business Basic Plus Professional Standard Advanced Enterprise First launched 2008 2008 2017 2011 2017 2015 Number of users 1 user 1 user 1 user 3+ users 3+ users Large deployments Base price ($USD) per user Free\\n$9.99/month $19.99/month $15.00/month $25.00/month Negotiated pricing $99/year $199/year $150/year $240/year Advanced sharing permissions Version history 30 days 30 days 120 days 120 days 120 days 120 days Smart Sync Showcase Team folders Unlimited\\nAPI access Paper Storage 2GB 1TB 1TB 2TB As much as needed As much as needed Support Basic email support Priority email support Priority chat support Live chat support Business hours phone support 24/7 phone support Assigned account success manager\\nAdvanced admin & security features Remote device wipe Remote device wipe Admin console Managed groups Access permissions Account transfer tool HIPAA support Everything in Standard Device approval Audit log Tiered admin roles SSO integration\\nEverything in Advanced EMM Network control Domain insights Integration support59Table of ContentsOur premium subscription plans, such as Professional and Advanced, provide more\\nfunctionality than other subscription plans and are offered at higher prices per user. Our Standard and Advanced subscription plans offer robust capabilities for businesses, and the vast majority of Dropbox Business teams, including those at Fortune\\n500 companies, purchase our Standard or Advanced subscription plans. While our Enterprise subscription plan offers more opportunities for customization, companies can subscribe to any of these team plans for their business needs.Our Business ModelDrive new\\nsignupsWe acquire users efficiently and at relatively low costs throughword-of-mouthreferrals, directin-productreferrals, and sharing of content.Anyone can create a Dropbox account for free through our website or app and be up and running in minutes. These users often share and\\ncollaborate with othernon-registeredusers, attracting new signups into our network. For example, many people use Dropbox for work and spread our platform by collaborating on projects or sharing content\\nexternally. We also acquire a small proportion of our registered users through paid marketing and distribution partnerships in which hardware manufacturerspre-installour software on their devices.We have over 500\\xa0million registered users on our platform, of which over 100\\xa0million signed up since the beginning of 2017.Increase conversion of registered users to our paid subscription plansDropbox Basic, the free version of our product, serves as a major funnel for conversions to our paid subscription plans. It fosters brand\\nawareness, product familiarity, and organic adoption of Dropbox. When they purchase a subscription, our users gain access to premium features such as richer collaboration tools, administrative controls, and advanced security features, as well as\\nlarger storage capacity. We believe that our current registered user base represents a significant opportunity to increase our revenue. We estimate that approximately 300 million of our registered users have at least one characteristic that we\\nbelieve makes them more likely than other registered users to pay over time. These characteristics include: (i) having signed up for Dropbox with a business domain email; (ii) having used specific types of computers or mobile devices to access our\\nplatform; or (iii) having signed up from certain countries in more developed markets in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific, and having linked a desktop or laptop to our platform. Substantially all of our paying users share at least one of these\\ncharacteristics. We’ve found that aggregate user activity metrics aren’t leading indicators of revenue or conversion. For that reason, we don’t comprehensively track user activity across the Dropbox platform for financial planning and\\nforecasting purposes.We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels—users who purchase a subscription through our app\\nor website. We actively encourage our registered users to become paying users throughin-productprompts and notifications, time-limited free trials of paid subscription plans, email campaigns, and lifecycle\\nmarketing.During the fourth quarter of 2017, hundreds of millions of devices—including computers, phones, and tablets—were\\nactively connected to the Dropbox platform. Because our users have installed Dropbox on many devices, we have multiple opportunities to inform them about new product experiences and premium subscription plans viain-productnotifications, without any external marketing spend.Our scale enables us to\\nexperiment and optimize the conversion marketing process. We run hundreds of product tests and targeted marketing campaigns simultaneously, and analyze usage patterns within our network to continually improve our user targeting and marketing\\nmessaging.60Table of ContentsUpgrade and expand existing customersWe offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus and Professional for individuals to Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise for teams. We\\nanalyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. For example, we prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our\\nStandard or Advanced plans for a better team experience. They can do this by either joining an existing Dropbox Business team or by creating a new Dropbox Business team and inviting others to join. In 2017, over 40% of new Dropbox Business teams\\nincluded a member who was previously a subscriber to one of our individual paid plans.We believe that a large majority of individual\\ncustomers use Dropbox for work, which creates an opportunity to significantly increase conversion to Dropbox Business team offerings over time. We also encourage existing Dropbox Business teams to purchase additional licenses or to upgrade to\\npremium subscription plans.Within an organization, Dropbox usage may be spread between a mix of Basic users, Plus and Professional\\nsubscribers, and one or more Dropbox Business teams. Our outbound sales team focuses on converting and consolidating these separate pockets of usage into a centralized deployment. Nearly all of our largest outbound deals originated as smaller\\nself-serve deployments.Our Attractive Cohort EconomicsWe define a cohort as all registered users who signed up for Dropbox in a given period of time. We track the total monthly subscription amount\\nof all paying users in each cohort as of the end of the month, or the monthly subscription amount. For paying users who opt for our monthly plans, the monthly subscription amount is equal to the price of the monthly plan. For paying users who opt\\nfor our annual plans, which a majority of our users do, the monthly subscription amount is equal to the price of the annual plan divided by twelve. These amounts increase as more registered users in each cohort convert to paying users, paying users\\nupgrade to premium subscription offerings, and team administrators purchase additional licenses. These amounts decrease when paying users terminate their subscriptions, downgrade their subscriptions to a lower tier, or team administrators reduce the\\nnumber of licenses on their subscription plans. We continuously focus on adding new users and increasing the value we offer to them. As a result, each cohort of new users typically generates higher subscription amounts over time.61Table of ContentsThe chart below reflects the monthly subscription amount from January 2013 to December 2017\\nof all paying users in each quarterly cohort, including those who signed up for our platform prior to 2013.We continuously focus on adding new users and increasing the value we offer to them. As a result, each\\ncohort of new users typically generates higher subscription amounts over time. For example, the monthly subscription amount generated by the January 2015 cohort doubled in less than three years after signup. We believe this cohort is representative\\nof a typical cohort in recent periods.62Table of ContentsMoreover, as we continue to innovate and optimize our go-to-market strategy, we have\\nsuccessfully increased monetization for subsequent cohorts. Comparing January cohorts from the last three years, at virtually every point in time after signup, the January 2017 cohort generated a higher monthly subscription amount than the January\\n2016 cohort, which in turn generated a higher monthly subscription amount than the January 2015 cohort.Our Global, Diversified Customer BaseThe growing need for a unified home for content and the viral nature of our business have allowed us to scale globally. We have paying users\\nacross 180 countries, and we generated approximately half of our revenue in 2017 from customers outside the United States.Our customer\\nbase is highly diversified, and in the periods presented, no customer accounted for more than 1% of our revenue. Our customers include individuals, teams, and organizations of all sizes, from freelancers and small businesses to Fortune 100\\ncompanies. They work across a wide range of industries, including professional services, technology, media, education, industrials, consumer and retail, and financial services. Within companies, our platform is used by all types of teams and\\nfunctions, including sales, marketing, product, design, engineering, finance, legal, and human resources.63Table of ContentsOur Predictable Subscription RevenueTaken together, our subscription revenue model, consistent cohort trends, self-serve monetization engine, and large and diversified global\\ncustomer base resulted in linear and predictable revenue generation over the duration of the quarters presented in the chart below.As of December 31, 2017, more than 80% of our annualized revenue came from existing individual users and\\nDropbox Business teams who were on our platform as of December 31, 2016.As of December 31, 2017, our Annualized Net Revenue Retention for\\npaying Dropbox Business customers was approximately 100%. Annualized Net Revenue Retention is the percentage of annualized revenue retained over a 365-day period, inclusive of changes in price, changes in number of licenses, upgrades and downgrades\\nto different subscription plans, and churn. We calculate Annualized Net Revenue Retention by aggregating the annualized revenue from all paying Dropbox Business customers subscribing to a Dropbox Business plan at the beginning of the period, then\\naggregating the annualized revenue from those same Dropbox Business customers at the end of the period. For customers whose renewal is pending at the end of the period, we include their annualized revenue in the ending total if they resume payment\\nwithin 30 days from the end of that period. Annualized Net Revenue Retention is equal to ending annualized revenue divided by beginning annualized revenue.As of December 31, 2017, our blended Annualized Net Revenue Retention across the entire business, including individuals and Dropbox Business\\ncustomers, was over 90%.Key Factors Affecting Our PerformanceWe believe that the growth and future success of our business depends on many factors. While each of these factors presents significant\\nopportunities for our business, they also pose important challenges that we must successfully address in order to sustain our growth and improve our results of operations.64Table of ContentsAttract Users and Expand Relationships with Them.Our business model is based\\non attracting new users to our platform, converting registered users to paying users, and retaining and expanding paying users’ subscriptions over time. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to offer compelling subscription plans\\nwith valuable capabilities, and to market these plans effectively to users. In addition, we must continue to provide a quality user experience to retain paying customers and encourage existing Dropbox Business teams to purchase additional licenses\\nfor their organizations over time. We intend to continue driving organic adoption by individual users and Dropbox Business teams through our self-serve model, and supplement this with our outbound sales force.Continued Investment in Growth.We intend to continue to make focused investments to increase revenue and scale operations to\\nsupport the growth of our business, and therefore expect expenses to increase. We plan to further invest in research and development as we hire employees in engineering, product, and design to enhance our platform and support the needs of our\\ngrowing user base. We also plan to invest in sales and marketing activities to drive our self-serve business model and increase our brand awareness. We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support our growth and our\\ntransition to being a publicly traded company. Further, we continue to make investments in our technical infrastructure to support user growth, and in our office locations to support employee growth, which will increase expenses and capital\\nexpenditures. As cost of revenue, operating expenses, and capital expenditures fluctuate over time, we may experience short-term, negative impacts to our results of operations and cash flows, but we are undertaking such investments in the belief\\nthat they will contribute to long-term growth.Ongoing Innovation in a Rapidly Changing Environment. The market for content\\ncollaboration platforms is characterized by rapid technological change and frequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to acquire, retain, and upgrade paying users will depend in part on our ability to enhance our platform, introduce\\nnew features, and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Certain features of our platform compete directly with products offered by Amazon, Apple, Atlassian, Box, Google, and Microsoft.\\nWe will need to continue to innovate in the face of this rapidly changing landscape to remain competitive.Key Business MetricsWe review a number of operating and financial metrics, including the following key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance,\\nidentify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.Paying usersWe define paying users as the number of users who have active paid licenses for access to our platform as of the end of the period. One person\\nwould count as multiple paying users if the person had more than one active license. For example, a 50-person Dropbox Business team would count as 50 paying users, and an individual Dropbox Plus user would count as one paying user. If that\\nindividual Dropbox Plus user was also part of the50-personDropbox Business team, we would count the individual as two paying users.We have experienced growth in the number of paying users across our products, with the vast majority of paying users for the periods presented\\ncoming from our self-serve channels.The below table sets forth the number of paying users as of December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017:As\\xa0of\\xa0December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Paying users6.58.811.065Table of ContentsAverage revenue per paying userWe define average revenue per paying user, or ARPU, as our revenue for the period presented divided by the average paying users during the same\\nperiod. For interim periods, we use annualized revenue, which is calculated by dividing the revenue for the particular period by the number of days in that period and multiplying this value by 365 days. Average paying users are calculated based on\\nadding the number of paying users as of the beginning of the period to the number of paying users as of the end of the period, and then dividing by two.Our ARPU declined for the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, compared to the year ended December\\xa031, 2015, primarily due to foreign\\ncurrency fluctuations related to our sales that are denominated in foreign currencies.Our ARPU increased for the year ended December\\xa031, 2017, compared to the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, primarily due to an increased mix\\nof sales towards our higher priced subscription plans, including our new Dropbox Business Advanced plan.The below table sets forth our\\nARPU for the years ended December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017.Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017ARPU$113.54$110.54$111.91Non-GAAPFinancial MeasureIn addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we believe that free cash\\nflow, or FCF, anon-GAAPfinancial measure, is useful in evaluating our liquidity.Free\\ncash flowWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that FCF is a\\nliquidity measure and that it provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental\\ninformational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for\\nanalysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under capital\\nleases, and may be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.We have\\nexperienced an increase in our FCF as a result of an increase in net cash provided by operating activities, primarily due to our Infrastructure Optimization discussed below in “ —Recent Initiative,” increased sales in the periods\\npresented, and a decrease in capital expenditures relating to infrastructure equipment and leasehold improvements for our office spaces. We expect our FCF to fluctuate in future periods as we purchase infrastructure equipment to support our user\\nbase and invest in our new and existing office spaces, including our new corporate headquarters, to support our plans for growth. These activities, along with certain increased operating expenses as described below, may result in a decrease in FCF\\nas a percentage of revenue in future periods.66Table of ContentsThe following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash\\nprovided by operating activities:Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$14.8$252.6$330.3Capital expenditures(78.7)(115.2)(25.3)Free cash flow$(63.9)$137.4$305.0Recent InitiativeInfrastructure OptimizationIn recent years, we have taken several steps to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that supports our platform. These efforts include\\nan initiative that focused on migrating the vast majority of user data stored on the infrastructure of third-party service providers to our own lower cost, custom-built infrastructure inco-locationfacilities\\nthat we directly lease and operate. In order to host user data on our own infrastructure, we leased or purchased infrastructure that is depreciated within our cost of revenue. During the migration to our internal infrastructure, we duplicated our\\nusers’ data between our internal infrastructure and that of our third-party service providers, resulting in higher storage costs. We reduced this practice over time until we completed the migration in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related to this\\ninitiative, we no longer duplicate data between our internal infrastructure and that of any third-party service providers. We expect to continue to realize benefits from expanding our internal infrastructure due to our operating scale and lower unit\\ncosts.Throughout 2016, we also took measures to manage the storage footprint of certain long-inactive Basic users, freeing up additional\\nstorage capacity. Specifically, we closed the accounts of certain Basic users who had not engaged in any activity on the Dropbox platform in the last year and did not respond to multiple e-mail inquiries from us regarding their inactivity. We\\ncontinue to regularly take similar measures to manage long-inactive and non-responsive Basic user accounts, and our total registered user numbers do not include accounts that have been closed. This effort, along with additional usage optimizations\\nin 2017, enabled us to continue operating our business within our existing infrastructure base without a need for extensive incremental capital expenditures and leasing activity.These efforts are collectively referred to as our Infrastructure Optimization, and some are ongoing.Our Infrastructure Optimization reduced unit costs and helped limit capital expenditures and associated depreciation. Combined with the\\nconcurrent increase in our base of paying users, we experienced a reduction in our cost of revenue, an increase in our gross margins, and an improvement in our free cash flow in the periods presented.Components of Our Results of OperationsRevenueWe\\ngenerate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform.Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally\\nbeginning on the date that our platform is made available to a customer. Our subscription agreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, although a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Our agreements are generallynon-cancelable.We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. Amounts that have been billed are initially recorded as deferred revenue\\nuntil the revenue is recognized.67Table of ContentsOur revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying users and the price we charge for\\naccess to our platform, which varies based on the type of plan to which a customer subscribes. We generate over 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels. No customer represented more than 1% of our revenue in the periods presented.Cost of revenue and gross marginCost of revenue.Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of our\\nplatform for both paying users and Basic users. These costs, which we refer to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of our servers located inco-locationfacilities that we lease and operate, rent and\\nfacilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for our infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes costs, such as salaries,\\nbonuses, benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting our infrastructure and delivering user support. Othernon-employeecosts included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions, and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities, depreciation on leasehold\\nimprovements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support initiatives, and property\\ntaxes related to the datacenters.We plan to continue increasing the capacity and enhancing the capability and reliability of our\\ninfrastructure to support user growth and increased use of our platform. We expect that cost of revenue, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation”,\\nwill increase in absolute dollars in future periods. In addition, as a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation,” we expect our cost of revenue to increase\\nsignificantly in absolute dollars in the quarter during which we complete this offering.Gross margin.Gross margin is gross\\nprofit expressed as a percentage of revenue. Our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of additional capital expenditures and the related depreciation expense, or other increases in our infrastructure costs, as well as\\nrevenue fluctuations. As we continue to increase the utilization of our internal infrastructure, we generally expect our gross margin, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of\\nStock-Based Compensation”, to remain relatively constant in the near term and to increase modestly in the long term. Taking into account these charges, we expect our gross margin to decrease significantly in the quarter during which we complete\\nthis offering.Operating expensesResearch and development.\\xa0Our research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering,\\nproduct, and design teams, and allocated overhead. Additionally, research and development expenses include internal development-related third-party hosting fees. We have expensed almost all of our research and development costs as they were\\nincurred.We plan to continue to hire employees for our engineering, product, and design teams to support our research and development\\nefforts. We expect that research and development costs will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based\\nCompensation”, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.Sales and marketing.\\xa0Our sales and marketing\\nexpenses relate to both self-serve and outbound sales activities, and consist primarily of employee-related costs, brand campaign fees, lead generation fees, and allocated overhead. Sales commissions earned by our outbound sales team and the related\\npayroll taxes, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers that we consider to be incremental and recoverable costs of68Table of Contentsobtaining a contract with a user, are deferred and amortized over an estimated period of benefit of five years. Additionally, sales and marketing expenses includenon-employeecosts related to app store fees and fees payable to third-party sales representatives.We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to grow our user base and increase our brand awareness, including marketing efforts to\\ncontinue to drive our self-serve business model. The trend and timing of sales and marketing expenses will depend in part on the timing of marketing campaigns. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future\\nperiods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation”, vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue.General and administrative.\\xa0Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our legal,\\nfinance, human resources, and other administrative teams, as well as certain executives. In addition, general and administrative expenses include allocated overhead, outside legal, accounting and other professional fees, andnon-incomebased taxes.We expect to incur additional general and administrative expenses to support\\nthe growth of the Company as well as our transition to being a publicly traded company, which includes the recognition of stock-based compensation expense related to grants of restricted stock made to our co-founders. We expect that general and\\nadministrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods and, excluding the impact of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based Compensation”, vary from period to\\nperiod as a percentage of revenue.As a result of certain stock-based compensation charges described in “—Significant Impacts\\nof Stock-Based Compensation,” we expect our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in the quarter during which we\\ncomplete this offering.Interest expense, netInterest expense, net consists primarily of interest expense related to our capital lease obligations for infrastructure and our imputed\\nfinancing obligation for our obligation to the legal owner of our previous corporate headquarters, partially offset by interest income earned on our money market funds classified as cash and cash equivalents.Other income (expense), netOther income (expense), net consists of othernon-operatinggains or losses, including those related to\\nongoing subleases and foreign currency transaction gains and losses.Provision for income taxesProvision for income taxes consists primarily of U.S. federal and state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which\\nwe conduct business. For the periods presented, the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and our effective tax rate is primarily due to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by earnings\\nrealized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for federal, state, and certain foreign jurisdictions as we have concluded\\nthat it is not more likely than not that the deferred assets will be realized.As of December\\xa031, 2017, we had $312.2\\xa0million\\nof federal and $143.0\\xa0million of state net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2031 for federal and 203069Table of Contentsfor state tax purposes. As of December\\xa031, 2017, we also had $289.3\\xa0million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will\\ncarryforward indefinitely. In addition, we had $22.9\\xa0million of foreign acquired net operating losses, which will carryforward indefinitely.\\xa0It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in time to use these net operating loss\\ncarryforwards before their expiration.\\xa0In addition, under Section\\xa0382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use\\nitspre-changenet operating loss carryforwards and otherpre-changeattributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In\\ngeneral, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax\\nlaws. We performed a study for the period through December 31, 2017, and determined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points have occurred. Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable\\nincome and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of ownership changes from January 1, 2018, and subsequent years, or as a result of this offering.On December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Reform Act, was enacted, which contains\\nsignificant changes to U.S. tax law. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21% and repeals the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, effective in 2018. As a result, we have remeasured our U.S. deferred\\ntax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower rate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse. We estimate the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a reduction in deferred tax\\nassets of $63.1 million, which is fully offset by a corresponding change to our valuation allowance. As a result of the repeal of AMT, we have recognized a benefit and established a receivable to reflect anticipated refunds of $1.4 million for our\\n2016 AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2017. Provisional accounting impacts may change in future reporting periods until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than one year from the date the Tax\\nReform Act was enacted.Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenue for those periods:Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Revenue$603.8$844.8$1,106.8Cost of revenue(1)407.4390.6368.9Gross profit196.4454.2737.9Operating expenses:(1)Research and development201.6289.7380.3Sales and marketing193.1250.6314.0General and administrative107.9107.4157.3Total operating expenses502.6647.7851.6Loss from operations(306.2)(193.5)(113.7)Interest expense, net(15.2)(16.4)(11.0)Other income (expense), net(4.2)4.913.2Loss before income taxes(325.6)(205.0)(111.5)Provision for income taxes(0.3)(5.2)(0.2)Net loss$(325.9)$(210.2)$(111.7)70Table of Contents(1)Includes stock-based compensation as follows:Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Cost of revenue$2.6$8.2$12.2Research and development36.172.793.1Sales and marketing19.844.633.7General and administrative7.622.125.6Total stock-based compensation$66.1$147.6$164.6Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(As a % of revenue)Revenue100%100%100%Cost of revenue674633Gross profit335467Operating expenses:Research and development333434Sales and marketing323028General and administrative181314Total operating expenses837777Loss from operations(51)(23)(10)Interest expense, net(3)(2)(1)Other income (expense), net(1)11Loss before income taxes(54)(24)(10)Provision for income taxes—(1)—Net loss(54)%(25)%(10)%Comparison of the year ended December\\xa031, 2016 and\\n2017RevenueYear\\xa0EndedDecember\\xa031,20162017$\\xa0Change%\\xa0Change(In millions)Revenue$844.8$1,106.8$262.031%Revenue increased $262.0\\xa0million or 31% during 2017, as compared to 2016.

The timing of brand advertising campaigns can impact the trends in sales and marketing expenses. The sequential decline in our sales and marketing expenses during the three months ended June\\xa030, 2016 was due to a stock-based\\ncompensation charge of $18.8\\xa0million related to the modification of an executive stock grant recorded in the three months ended March\\xa031, 2016.

Our cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash and\\nmoney market funds. As of December 31, 2017, we had $86.3 million of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect to incur material taxes in the event we repatriate any of these amounts.Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances, cash generated from our operations, and capital\\nleases to finance infrastructure-related assets inco-locationfacilities that we directly lease and operate. We enter into capital leases in part to better match the timing of payments for\\ninfrastructure-related assets with that of cash received from our paying users. In our business model, some of our registered users convert to paying users over time, and consequently there is a lag between initial investment in infrastructure\\nassets and cash received from some of our users. We expect to increase our use of capital leases to finance infrastructure equipment as certain assets reach the end of their useful lives in future periods.Our principal uses of cash in recent periods have been funding our operations, making principal payments on our capital lease obligations, the\\nsatisfaction of tax withholdings in connection with the settlement of restricted stock units, and making capital expenditures.In April\\n2017, we entered into a $600.0 million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions.The revolving credit facility has an accordion option, which, if exercised, would allow us to increase the aggregate commitments by up to\\n$150.0\\xa0million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain conditions. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we may issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility, which reduce the\\ntotal amount available for borrowing under such facility. The revolving credit facility terminates on April\\xa04, 2022.Interest on\\nborrowings under the revolving credit facility accrues at a variable rate tied to the prime rate or the LIBOR rate, at our election. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, we are required to\\npay an annual commitment fee that accrues at a rate of 0.20% per annum on the77Table of Contentsunused portion of the borrowing commitments under the revolving credit facility. In addition, we are required to pay a fee in connection with letters of credit issued under the revolving credit\\nfacility that accrues at a rate of 1.5% per annum on the amount to be drawn under such letters of credit outstanding. There is an additional fronting fee of 0.125% per annum multiplied by the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be\\ndrawn under all letters of credit.The revolving credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default, and\\ncovenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make distributions to our holders or our subsidiaries’ equity interests, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates. In addition,\\nthe revolving credit facility contains financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity balance. We were in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017.As of December 31, 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and an aggregate of $82.6\\xa0million in letters\\nof credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Our total available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility was $517.4\\xa0million as of December 31, 2017.In February 2018, we amended our revolving credit facility to, among other things, permit us to make certain investments, enter into an\\nunsecured standby letter of credit facility, and increase our standby letter of credit sublimit to $187.5 million. We also increased our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $600.0\\xa0million to $725.0\\xa0million. We may\\nfrom time to time request increases in our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of up to $275.0\\xa0million, provided no event of default has occurred or is continuing or would result from such increase.We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash provided by operations and amounts available under the revolving credit\\nfacility, will be sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of\\nspending to support further infrastructure development and research and development efforts, the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces, such as our new corporate headquarters, the\\nsatisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units, the expansion of sales and marketing and international operation activities, the introduction of new product capabilities and enhancement of our platform, and the\\ncontinuing market acceptance of our platform. We may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek additional\\nequity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results\\nof operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.Our cash flow activities were as follows for the\\nperiods presented:Year ended December\\xa031,201520162017(In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$14.8$252.6$330.3Net cash used in investing activities(85.6)(118.0)(23.9)Net cash used in financing activities(89.6)(134.5)(231.7)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(0.9)(4.3)2.6Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(161.3)$(4.2)$77.3Operating activitiesOur largest source of operating cash is cash collections from our paying users for subscriptions to our platform. Our primary uses of cash from\\noperating activities are for employee-related expenditures,78Table of Contentsinfrastructure-related costs, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and\\namortization expenses and stock-based compensation, as well as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.For the year\\nended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $330.3\\xa0million, which mostly consisted of our net loss of $111.7 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses of $181.8 million and stock-based compensation\\nexpense of $164.6 million, and net cash inflow of $81.3 million from operating assets and liabilities. The inflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $64.3 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription\\nsales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to a reduction of\\nour net loss, as adjusted for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $252.6 million, which primarily consisted of our net loss\\nof $210.2 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses of $191.6 million and stock-based compensation expense of $147.6 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $118.8 million from operating assets and liabilities. The inflow from\\noperating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $87.6 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription sales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance, and an increase of $35.6 million in accrued\\ncompensation and benefits due to the introduction of our annual bonus plan. The increase in net cash from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to a reduction of our net loss, as adjusted for stock-based compensation\\nand depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as cash inflow from changes in operating assets and liabilities.For the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $14.8 million, which mostly consisted of our net loss of $325.9 million, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expenses of $149.6 million and stock-based compensation expense of\\n$66.1 million, as well as a net cash inflow of $123.6 million from operating assets and liabilities. The inflow from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $82.0 million in deferred revenue from increased subscription\\nsales, as a majority of our paying users are invoiced in advance, and an increase of $50.6 million in current and non-current liabilities.Investing activitiesNet cash used in investing activities is primarily impacted by purchases of property and equipment, particularly for purchasing infrastructure\\nequipment in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate, and for making improvements to existing and new office spaces.For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $23.9 million, which mostly consisted of capital expenditures\\nrelated to our infrastructure equipment and office build-outs. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to decreases in capital\\nexpenditures for infrastructure equipment and leasehold improvements related to our current corporate headquarters.For the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $118.0 million, which mostly consisted of capital expenditures related to our infrastructure and office build-outs. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared\\nto 2015 was primarily due to increases in capital expenditures and patent purchases.For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used\\nin investing activities was $85.6 million, which mostly consisted of capital expenditures related to our infrastructure equipment and office build-outs.79Table of ContentsFinancing activitiesNet cash used in financing activities is primarily impacted by capital lease obligations for our infrastructure equipment and repurchases of\\ncommon stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligation for the release of restricted stock units (“RSUs”). In 2017, we began releasing shares of common stock underlying vested one-tier RSUs, which generally have a service-based vesting\\ncondition over a four-year period and resulted in cash outflows to satisfy the employee tax withholding obligation for those employees who elected to net share settle their awards. See “—Significant Impacts of Stock-Based\\nCompensation” for additional information.For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $231.7\\nmillion, which primarily consisted of $133.0 million in principal payments against capital lease obligations and $87.9 million for the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of restricted stock units. The increase in cash used\\nby financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily due to the increase of $87.9 million related to the satisfaction of tax withholding obligations for the release of\\nrestricted stock units.For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $134.5 million, which primarily\\nconsisted of $137.9 million in principal payments against capital lease obligations and $3.8 million in principal payments against the note payable issued in 2015 as described below, offset by $8.8 million in proceeds received for a sale-leaseback\\nagreement. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to an increase of $36.7 million in principal payments on capital leases for our infrastructure, a decrease of $11.9 million in cash received\\nthrough the issuance of a note payable issued in 2015, as well as an increase of $3.8 million in payments against the note payable in 2016, partially offset by $8.8 million in cash received in a sale lease-back agreement.For the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash used in financing activities was $89.6 million, which primarily consisted of $101.2 million in\\nprincipal payments against capital lease obligations, offset by $11.9 million in cash received through the issuance of a note payable to finance our infrastructure.Contractual ObligationsOur principal\\ncommitments consist of obligations under operating leases for office space and datacenter operations, and capital leases for datacenter equipment. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of\\nDecember 31, 2017, for the periods presented below:TotalLess\\xa0than1 year1\\xa0-\\xa03\\xa0years3\\xa0-\\xa05\\xa0yearsMore\\xa0than5 years(In millions)Operating lease commitments(1)$1,349.9$91.5$336.8$201.8$719.8Capital lease commitments(2)182.0108.373.7——Other commitments(3)155.164.086.30.64.2Total contractual obligations$1,687.0$263.8$496.8$202.4$724.0(1)Consists of futurenon-cancelableminimum rental payments under operating leases for our offices and datacenters, excluding\\nrent payments from our sub-tenants and variable operating expenses.Non-cancelablerent payments from our sub-tenants as of December\\xa031, 2017, for the next six years are expected to be $72.1 million.(2)Consists of futurenon-cancelableminimum rental payments under capital leases primarily for our infrastructure.(3)Consists of commitments to third-party vendors for services related to our infrastructure, infrastructure warranty contracts, payments related to the imputed\\nfinancing obligation for our previous headquarters, asset retirement obligations for office modifications, and a note payable related to financing of our infrastructure.In addition to the contractual obligations set forth above, as of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of $82.6\\xa0million in letters of\\ncredit outstanding under our revolving credit facility.80Table of ContentsIn October 2017, we entered into a new lease agreement for office space in San Francisco,\\nCalifornia, to serve as our new corporate headquarters. We expect to start making recurring rental payments under the lease in the third quarter of 2019. Included in the operating lease commitments above are our total expected minimum obligations\\nunder the lease agreement of $827.0 million, which exclude expected tenant improvement reimbursements from the landlord of approximately $73.6\\xa0million and variable operating expenses. Our obligations under the lease are supported by a\\n$34.2\\xa0million letter of credit, which reduced the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.We plan to take possession\\nof our new corporate headquarters over several phases. We expect to take initial possession in mid-2018, after which time we plan to incur capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and to begin recording rent expense for the portion of the new\\ncorporate headquarters that we have the right to use. Capital expenditures will continue to increase as we take possession of the remaining space over the next few years. We will continue to operate in our current corporate headquarters until the\\nnew corporate headquarters is ready for occupancy, which is expected to be in 2019. We intend to sublease our current corporate headquarters once we occupy the new corporate headquarters. However, unless we transfer our contractual obligation, we\\nwill continue to include the committed lease payments for our current corporate headquarters in the table above.Off-BalanceSheet ArrangementsAs of December\\xa031, 2017, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often\\nreferred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Significant Impacts of Stock-Based CompensationRestricted Stock UnitsWe have granted restricted stock units, or RSUs, to our employees and members of our Board of Directors under our 2008 Equity Incentive Plan,\\nor 2008 Plan, and our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, or 2017 Plan. We have two types of RSUs outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2017:•One-tierRSUs, which have a service-based vesting condition over a four-year period. These awards typically have a cliff vesting period of one year and continue to vest quarterly\\nthereafter. We recognize compensation expense associated withone-tierRSUs ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.•Two-tierRSUs, which have both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. These awards typically have a service-based vesting\\nperiod of four years with a cliff vesting period of one year and continue to vest monthly thereafter. Upon satisfaction of the Performance Vesting Condition, these awards will vest quarterly. The Performance Vesting Condition is satisfied on the\\nearlier of (i)\\xa0an acquisition or change in control of the Company or (ii)\\xa0the earlier of (a)\\xa0six months after our initial public offering or (b)\\xa0March\\xa015 of the year following our initial public offering. Our Board of\\nDirectors has approved the acceleration of the Performance Vesting Condition for two-tier RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of December 31, 2017, to occur upon the effectiveness of our registration statement related to this\\noffering. Our last grant date fortwo-tierRSUs was May 2015.As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2017, all compensation expense related totwo-tierRSUs remained unrecognized because the Performance Vesting Condition was not satisfied. At the time the Performance Vesting Condition\\nbecomes probable, we will recognize the cumulativestock-basedcompensation expense for the two-tier RSUs that have met their service-based vesting condition using the accelerated attribution method. If the\\nPerformance Vesting Condition had occurred on December\\xa031, 2017, we would have recorded $415.6\\xa0million of stock-based compensation expense. As of December\\xa031, 2017, 42.2\\xa0milliontwo-tierRSUs were outstanding, of which 39.1\\xa0million had met their service condition. If the Performance Vesting Condition had been satisfied on these two-tier RSUs as of December 31, 2017, we would recognize unamortized stock-based compensation\\nexpense of $5.6 million over a weighted-average period of approximately one year if the requisite service is provided.81Table of ContentsCo-Founder GrantsIn December 2017, the Board of Directors approved a grant to our co-founders of restricted stock awards, or RSAs, with respect to 22.1 million\\nshares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate, or collectively, the Co-Founder Grants, of which\\xa015.5 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Houston, the Company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and 6.6 million RSAs were granted to Mr.\\nFerdowsi, the Company’s co-founder and Director. These Co-Founder Grants have service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. While the Co-Founder Grants have certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the\\nshares with the other holders of our Class A common stock, the Co-Founder Grants will be excluded from Class A common stock issued and outstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions.The Co-Founder Grants are eligible to vest over the ten-year period following the closing of this offering. The Co-Founder Grants comprise\\nnine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, or, each, a Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive thirty-day trading period during the Performance Period, as follows:Company\\xa0Stock\\xa0PriceTargetShares\\xa0Eligible\\xa0to\\xa0Vest\\xa0forMr. HoustonShares\\xa0Eligible\\xa0to\\xa0Vestfor\\xa0Mr.\\xa0Ferdowsi$20.003,100,0001,320,000$25.001,550,000660,000$30.001,550,000660,000$35.001,550,000660,000$40.001,550,000660,000$45.001,550,000660,000$50.001,550,000660,000$55.001,550,000660,000$60.001,550,000660,000The Performance Period begins on the first trading day following the later of (a) the expiration of the\\nlock-up period following the first date the Company’s shares are traded on an established national securities exchange or automated quotation system, or the IPO Date, and (b) January 1, 2019, and ends on the earliest to occur of: (i)\\xa0the\\ndate on which all shares subject to the Co-Founder Grants vest, (ii) the date the applicable co-founder ceases to satisfy the service-based vesting condition, (iii) the tenth anniversary of the IPO Date, and (iv) the occurrence of an acquisition of\\nthe Company prior to the IPO Date.During the first four years of the Performance Period, no more than 20% of the shares subject to each\\nCo-Founder Grant would be eligible to vest in any calendar year. After the first four years, all shares are eligible to vest based on the achievement of the Company Stock Price Targets.The Co-Founder Grants contain an implied performance-based vesting condition satisfied upon the IPO Date, because no shares subject to the\\nCo-Founder Grants will vest unless the IPO Date occurs. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, all compensation expense related to the Co-Founder Grants remained unrecognized because the performance-based vesting condition was not deemed probable of\\nbeing achieved.We estimated the grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants using a model based on multiple stock price paths\\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the Stock Price Targets may not be satisfied. The average grant date fair value of each Co-Founder Grant was estimated to be $7.07 per\\nshare, and we will recognize total stock-based compensation expense of $156.2 million over the requisite service period of each tranche, which ranged from 2.9 to 6.9 years, using the accelerated attribution method.\\xa0If the Stock Price Targets\\nare met sooner than the derived service period, we will adjust our stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. We will recognize stock-based compensation expense if the requisite service period is\\nprovided, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.82Table of ContentsIn the period the relevant performance vesting condition becomes probable, we will recognize\\nthe cumulative unrecognized expense of our two-tier RSUs and Co-Founder Grants, which will increase our cost of revenue and operating expenses with respect to our two-tier RSUs, and will increase our general and administrative expenses with respect\\nto our Co-Founder Grants, for the quarter and year of our initial public offering. We expect that our research and development expenses will be the line item most significantly impacted by the cumulative expense to be recognized.See Note 1, “Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 11, “Stockholders’\\nEquity” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for more information.Critical Accounting Policies and\\nJudgmentsOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this prospectus are prepared in\\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the\\nestimates made by management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be affected.We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the\\npolicies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No.2014-09Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or Topic 606. Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification,Revenue Recognition, or\\nTopic 605, and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Topic\\n606 also includes Subtopic340-40,Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer.We adopted the requirements of Topic 606 as of January\\xa01, 2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. As such, Topic 606\\nis reflected in our financial results for all periods presented in this prospectus. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition and deferred commissions.The impact of adopting Topic 606 on our revenue was not material to any of the periods presented. The primary impact of adopting Topic 606\\nrelates to the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and the amortization of those costs over a longer period of benefit.Revenue recognitionWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform. Subscription fees exclude sales and other indirect taxes. We determine revenue\\nrecognition through the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price83Table of Contents•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligationOur subscription\\nagreements typically have monthly or annual contractual terms, and a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term generally beginning on the date that our platform is made\\navailable to a customer. Our agreements are generally non-cancelable. We typically bill in advance for monthly contracts and annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer.Deferred commissionsSales commissions and the related payroll taxes earned by our outbound sales team, as well as commissions earned by third-party resellers, are\\nconsidered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized over a period of benefit that we have determined to be five years. We determined the period of benefit by taking\\ninto consideration our historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of our technology, and the impact of competition in our industry. Changing the period of benefit by one year would result in a change to expense of approximately\\n$1.0\\xa0million or less in each of the periods presented. Amortization of deferred commissions is included in sales and marketing expenses.Common stock valuationsSince August 2015, we have granted RSUs as the only stock-based payment awards to our employees, excluding the Co-Founder Grants. While we\\nstopped granting stock options in August 2015, we currently have stock options outstanding that will continue to vest through 2019 if the requisite service is provided.The fair values of the common stock underlying the RSUs were determined by our Board of Directors, with input from management and\\ncontemporaneous third-party valuations, which were performed at least quarterly. If RSUs were granted a short period of time prior to the date of a valuation report, we retrospectively assessed the fair value used for financial reporting purposes\\nafter considering the fair value reflected in the subsequent valuation report and other facts and circumstances on the date of grant as discussed below.Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public\\nAccountants Practice Guide,Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity SecuritiesIssued as Compensation,or AICPA Guide, our Board of Directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective\\nfactors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:•The results of contemporaneous valuations of our common stock by unrelated third parties;•The rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock;•Market multiples of comparable public companies in our industry as indicated by their market capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions;•Our performance and market position relative to our competitors, who may change from time to time;•Our historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for our future performance;•Valuations published by institutional investors that hold investments in our capital stock;•The economic and competitive environment;•The likelihood and timeline of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale, given prevailing market conditions;84Table of Contents•Any adjustments necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and•Precedent sales of or offers to purchase our capital stock.In valuing our common stock, our\\nBoard of Directors determined the fair value of our common stock using both the income and market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These\\nfuture cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital, and is adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in our cash flows. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison\\nof the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company’s financial forecasts to estimate\\nthe value of the subject company.For valuations prior to August\\xa031, 2017, the equity valuation was based on both the income and the\\nmarket approach valuation methods, in addition to giving consideration to recent secondary sales of our common stock. The Option Pricing Method was selected as the principal equity allocation method. These methods were consistent with prior\\nvaluations.For valuations as of and subsequent to August\\xa031, 2017, we have used a hybrid method to determine the fair value of our\\ncommon stock, in addition to giving consideration to recent secondary sales of our common stock. Under the hybrid method, multiple valuation approaches were used and then combined into a single probability weighted valuation. Our approach included\\nthe use of initial public offering scenarios, a scenario assuming continued operation as a private entity, and a scenario assuming an acquisition of the company.Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those\\nregarding our expected future revenue, expenses, and cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the\\nrelationships between those assumptions, impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of common stock.For valuations after the completion of this initial public offering, our Board of Directors will determine the fair value of each share of\\nunderlying common stock based on the closing price of our Class\\xa0A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.Fair\\nvalue of market condition awardsThe Co-Founder Grants contain market-based vesting conditions. The market-based vesting condition\\nis considered when calculating the grant date fair value of these awards, which requires the use of various estimates and assumptions. The grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants was estimated using a model based on multiple stock price paths\\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. A Monte Carlo simulation requires the use of various assumptions, including our underlying\\nstock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. A Monte Carlo simulation also calculates a derived service\\nperiod for each of the nine vesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve the market conditions. Expense associated with market-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period of each tranche using the\\naccelerated attribution method, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.Business combinations and valuation of\\ngoodwill and other acquired intangible assetsWhen we acquire a business, we allocate the purchase price to the net tangible and\\nidentifiable intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. The estimation of85Table of Contentsthe fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires management to apply significant judgment, especially with respect to intangible assets, which consist primarily of developed\\ntechnologies.These estimates are based upon a number of factors, including historical experience, market conditions, and information\\nobtained from the management of acquired companies. To determine the fair value of acquired intangible assets, we make estimates that can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the\\nappropriate weighted-average cost of capital to utilize, the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset, and the expected use of the asset. These same factors are also considered in determining the useful life of acquired intangible\\nassets, which impacts the timing of future amortization expense.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,Leases (Topic 842). Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the\\nrecognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to\\nassess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified\\nretrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption by public entities is permitted. We are in the initial stage of our assessment of\\nthe new standard and are currently evaluating the timing of adoption, the quantitative impact of adoption, and the related disclosure requirements. We anticipate the adoption of this standard will result in a substantial increase in our non-current\\nassets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations. While we are assessing all potential impacts of the adoption of\\nthe standard, we currently expect the most significant impact to be the capitalization of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities for our office space and datacenter operating leases. We expect our accounting for capital leases related to\\ninfrastructure equipment to remain substantially unchanged under the new standard.See Note 1, “Description of the Business and\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus for more information about other recent accounting pronouncements.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange, and inflation risks.Interest rate riskWe had cash and cash equivalents of $430.0\\xa0million as of December 31, 2017. We hold our cash and cash equivalents for working capital\\npurposes. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits and money market funds. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs, and the control of cash and\\ninvestments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a\\nresult of changes in interest rates. Decreases in interest rates, however, would reduce future interest income.Any borrowings under the\\nrevolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate tied to the prime rate or the LIBOR rate. As of December 31, 2017, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We do not have any other long-term debt or financial\\nliabilities with floating interest rates that would subject us to interest rate fluctuations.86Table of ContentsA hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not\\nhave had a material impact on our financial statements.Foreign currency exchange riskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to U.S.\\ndollars, our reporting currency. Our revenue is generated in U.S. dollars, euros, British pounds sterling, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, and Japanese yen. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are\\nlocated, which are primarily the United States and, to a lesser extent, Europe and Asia. The functional currency of Dropbox International Unlimited, our international headquarters and largest international entity, is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our\\nresults of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates in ways that are unrelated to our operating performance. As exchange rates may fluctuate significantly between periods,\\nrevenue and operating expenses, when converted into U.S. dollars, may also experience significant fluctuations between periods. Historically, a majority of our revenue and operating expenses have been denominated in U.S. dollars, euros, and British\\npounds sterling. Although we are impacted by the exchange rate movements from a number of currencies relative to the U.S.\\xa0dollar, our results of operations are particularly impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar-euro and U.S.\\ndollar-British pounds sterling exchange rate. In 2017, 29% of our sales were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our expenses, by contrast, are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, any increase in the value of the U.S.\\ndollar against these foreign currencies could cause our revenue to decline relative to our costs, thereby decreasing our gross margins.We recorded $4.6\\xa0million and $3.6\\xa0million in net foreign currency transaction losses in the years ended December\\xa031, 2015 and\\n2016, respectively, and $5.0 million in net foreign currency transaction gains in the year ended December 31, 2017. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would not have resulted in material gains or losses for the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017.To date, we have not engaged in any hedging activities. As our international operations grow, we\\nwill continue to reassess our approach to managing risks relating to fluctuations in currency rates.Inflation riskWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Nonetheless, if our\\ncosts were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, or financial condition.87Table of ContentsA letter from Drew & Arash The early days Arash and I started Dropbox with the idea that life would be better if our\\nmost important information lived in the cloud. Seemingly overnight, millions of people around the world were using Dropbox to sync their photos and documents. Many of them would write in saying how much they loved the product, and their stories were\\nfascinating. We heard from scientists researching Alzheimer’s, filmmakers at Sundance, and disaster relief workers rescuing earthquake victims. We even got fan mail from an inventive group of farmers who were using Dropbox to coordinate\\ntractors via satellite (we never really figured out how that worked). These people had something in common. For them, Dropbox wasn’t just about keeping files in sync. It was about keeping people in sync—connecting people and their most\\nimportant information. We were intrigued. Helping teams work better wasn’t the problem we set out to solve, but following our users would take us on a much bigger journey. How teams work today As we observed teams more closely, it became clear\\nto us that while technology had made working life better in many ways, there was also a dark side. We were shocked by how much time our users were spending on things like searching for information, keeping teammates in the loop, and dealing with\\nemail. In fact, many employees spent more time on these tasks—all the “work about work”—than the jobs they were hired to do. This overhead only increased as teams grew larger. To make matters worse, newer collaboration tools were\\nturning the workday into a blizzard of interruptions. Notifications pinged at all hours, demanding immediate responses. Work was spilling over into every waking moment, contributing to deeper problems like anxiety and burnout.88Table of ContentsModern technology is clearly making us busier. But is it making us more productive? It feels like our “productivity\\ntools” are robbing us of the time and space to think. You’d think they’d be working for us, but somehow we’ve ended up working for them. Why this matters “Work about work” and constant distractions aren’t just\\nexhausting us, they’re also wasting our potential. Think about it: if Einstein were alive today, he’d start his day by clearing Groupons and LinkedIn invitations out of his inbox. Then he’d get down to work—and right before his\\nEureka moment, his phone would buzz with a Slack message. Would we still understand relativity? As a species, over and over we’ve used our ingenuity to profoundly improve our lives. This is the engine of human progress: our time and creativity\\ngo in, and solutions to our biggest problems come out. So we need to start treating our collective creative energy like the incredibly precious resource it is—the fuel for human progress. We can’t make more of this fuel. But we can get\\nbetter mileage. We can fix this In the last decade, psychology and neuroscience have shed light on what we need to be productive and feel fulfilled. Research shows that we perform at our best when we can focus, when we’re well rested, and when\\nwe have a sense of purpose. Wouldn’t it be great if our working environment—and the tools we use—were designed with these needs in mind? Imagine if we finished work every day knowing what we did really mattered. This is possible, and\\nDropbox is connecting the dots. Last year, we unveiled a new mission: . That might sound a little out there, but our first mission did, too.89Table of ContentsHow we’ll get there The path to enlightened work starts with creating a better environment. More and more, the work\\nwe do every day happens on screens. We believe that these virtual spaces should be as thoughtfully designed as our most inspiring physical spaces. How will Dropbox make this happen? To start, teams need to have all their information in one place.\\nIt’s crazy that in 2018, it’s easier to search all of human knowledge than a company’s knowledge—at home we have one search box, but at work we have ten. We see a big opportunity to solve this problem by continuing to tie the\\nworld’s different tools and ecosystems together. We also need to design a calm environment that fosters flow. Our workspace should feel organized and surface only what’s relevant. It should tune out the chatter—more communication\\nisn’t always better. The experience should be seamless. You shouldn’t have to use one app to write a doc and another to talk about it. Our newer products like Dropbox Paper are designed with these principles in mind. And over time, machine\\nintelligence will allow Dropbox to better understand both you and your team. Imagine getting to work in the morning to find your calendar reorganized so you have a three-hour block of time to actually focus. Imagine starting your day and seeing the\\nperfect to-do list—one based on a deep understanding of your priorities and your team’s priorities. We’re on our way For millions of people and businesses, Dropbox is already a living workspace—the place where people come\\ntogether and their ideas come to life. These users entrust us with their most valuable information. We think this is a huge advantage that will serve as the foundation of our reimagined work experience. Dropbox is also operating at a scale that few\\ncompanies have achieved. We have over 500 million registered users who store a billion gigabytes of their data on our platform. And we’ve made this cost-effective by building one of the largest, most efficient cloud infrastructures in the\\nworld. Along the way, we’ve written a new playbook for business software. Our millions of users are our best salespeople and have helped us acquire customers with incredible efficiency. As a result, we reached a billion dollar revenue run rate\\nfaster than any software-as-a-service company in history.90Table of ContentsAnd while we’re at scale, we can still move quickly. We have a lot less baggage than the incumbents. The legacy\\noffice suites have had a good run, but they were designed for a world where the most important thing you did was print something out. There’s a reason why BlackBerry didn’t come up with the iPhone. Sometimes it’s better to start\\nfresh. But what gives Arash and me the most confidence is our team of nearly 2,000 Dropboxers around the world. We’re a little biased, but we think we have one of the most talented teams ever assembled, and we grow stronger every year. Join us\\nWe all deserve a fulfilling work life. Imagine if every minute at work were well spent—if we could focus and spend our time on the things that matter. Imagine how much more inspired we’d be. Imagine how much better equipped we’d be to\\ntackle humanity’s biggest challenges. This is the world we want to live in. We hope you’ll join us. Drew & Arash91Table of ContentsBUSINESSOur BusinessOur modern economy runs on\\nknowledge. Today, knowledge lives in the cloud as digital content, and Dropbox is a global collaboration platform where more and more of this content is created, accessed, and shared with the world. We serve more than 500 million registered users\\nacross 180 countries.Dropbox was founded in 2007 with a simple idea: Life would be a lot better if everyone could access their most\\nimportant information anytime from any device. Over the past decade, we’ve largely accomplished that mission—but along the way we recognized that for most of our users, sharing and collaborating on Dropbox was even more valuable than\\nstoring files.Our market opportunity has grown as we’ve expanded from keeping files in sync to keeping teams in sync. Today,\\nDropbox is well positioned to reimagine the way work gets done. We’re focused on reducing the inordinate amount of time and energy the world wastes on “work about work”—tedious tasks like searching for content, switching between\\napplications, and managing workflows.We want to free up our users to spend more of their time on the work that truly matters. Our\\nmission is to unleash the world’s creative energy by designing a more enlightened way of working.We believe the need for our\\nplatform will continue to grow as teams become more fluid and global, and content is increasingly fragmented across incompatible tools and devices. Dropbox breaks down silos by centralizing the flow of information between the products and services\\nour users prefer, even if they’re not our own.By solving these universal problems, we’ve become invaluable to our users. The\\npopularity of our platform drives viral growth, which has allowed us to scale rapidly and efficiently. We’ve built a thriving global business with over 11\\xa0million paying users.Our revenue was $603.8\\xa0million, $844.8\\xa0million, and $1,106.8\\xa0million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, representing an\\nannual growth rate of 40% and 31%, respectively. We generated net losses of $325.9\\xa0million, $210.2\\xa0million, and $111.7 million in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. We also generated positive free cash flow of $137.4\\xa0million and\\n$305.0\\xa0million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, compared to negative free cash flow of $63.9\\xa0million in 2015.Our UsersWe’re constantly inspired by the diverse ways people use Dropbox to bring their ideas to life and achieve their missions faster. Here are\\njust a few examples:•NobelPrize-winningresearchers sync data with collaborators to speed development of new scientific breakthroughs.•Designers for a sustainable apparel company iterate on new designs and coordinate store openings.•A commercial construction company shares blueprints with subcontractors on job sites and sends bids to prospective clients.•A Fortune 500 online travel company keeps its global workforce connected with business partners around the world.•Pro bono lawyers at a refugee assistance organization collect and share information across continents to save lives.92Table of ContentsWhat Sets Us ApartSince the beginning, we’ve focused on simplifying the lives of our users. In a world where business software can be frustrating to use,\\nchallenging to integrate, and expensive to sell, we take a different approach.Simple and intuitive designWhile traditional tools developed in the desktop age have struggled to keep up with evolving user demands, Dropbox was designed for the cloud\\nera. We build simple, beautiful products that bring joy to our users and make it easier for them to do their best work. Unencumbered by legacy features, we can perfect the aspects of our platform that matter most today, such as the mobile experience\\nand the ability to work in teams.Open ecosystemWe know people will continue to use a wide variety of tools and platforms. That’s why we’ve built Dropbox to work seamlessly with\\nother products, integrating with partners from Google and Microsoft to Slack and Autodesk. More than 75% of Dropbox Business teams have linked to one or more third-party applications.Viral,bottom-upadoptionOur 500\\xa0million registered users are our best salespeople. They’ve spread Dropbox to their friends and brought us into their offices.\\nEvery year, millions of individual users sign up for Dropbox at work.Bottom-upadoption within organizations has been critical to our success as users increasingly choose their own tools at work. We generate\\nover 90% of our revenue from self-serve channels—users who purchase a subscription through our app or website.Performance and\\nsecurityOur custom-built infrastructure allows us to maintain high standards of performance, availability, and security. Dropbox\\nis built on proprietary, block-level sync technology to achieve industry-leading performance. In 2016, IDC highlighted our sync performance asbest-in-class,outperforming competitors on multiple sync tests, including upload and download speeds for large files. We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. We also offer numerous\\nlayers of protection, from secure file data transfer and encryption to network configuration and application-level controls.Industry Trends in Our\\nFavorContent is increasingly scatteredThe proliferation of devices, operating systems, and applications has dramatically increased the volume and complexity of content in the\\nworkplace. Content is now routinely scattered across multiple silos, making it harder to access. According to a 2016 IDC report, more than half of companies ranging from 100 to 5,000+ employees use at least three repositories for accessing documents\\non a weekly basis.The tools people use are fragmentedContent created at work tends to follow a predictable pattern: It’s authored, sent out for feedback, and shared or published once\\nit’s done. At the same time, teams are organizing that content and coordinating tasks around it. But many of the tools people use today don’t work well together and support only one or two steps of the content lifecycle. This requires\\nusers to constantly switch between these tools and makes it even harder to get work done.Teams have become more fluid and globalTechnology hasn’t kept up with a modern workforce that’s increasingly fluid and mobile. People work together on teams\\nthat span different functions, organizations, and geographies. A 2016 study by Deloitte found93Table of Contentsthat 37% of the global workforce is now mobile, 30% of full-time employees primarily work remotely, and 20% of the workforce is made up of temporary workers, contractors, and freelancers. The\\nability to swiftly disseminate content and its relevant context is critical to keeping teams in sync.“Work about work”\\nis wasteful and stifles creativityThe combination of scattered content, fragmented tools, and fluid team structures has led to\\ndecreased workplace productivity. According to a report by McKinsey\\xa0& Company, knowledge workers spend approximately 60% of their time at work on tedious tasks such as searching for content, reviewing email, andre-sharingcontext to keep team members in the loop—what we call “work about work.” This means they spend just 40% of their time doing the jobs they were hired to do.Individual users are changing the way software is adopted and purchasedSoftware purchasing decisions have traditionally been made by an organization’s IT department, which often deploys products that employees\\ndon’t like and many refuse to adopt. As individuals increasingly choose their own tools at work, purchasing power has become more decentralized. A 2017 IDC report noted that new devices and software were being adopted at a faster rate by\\nindividual users than by IT departments.Our SolutionDropbox allows individuals, teams, and organizations to collaborate more effectively. Anyone can sign up for free through our website or app,\\nand upgrade to a paid subscription plan for premium features. Our platform offers an elegant solution to the challenges described above.Key elements of our platform•Unified home for content.We provide a unified home for the world’s content and the relevant context around it. To date, our users have added more than 400\\xa0billion pieces of content to Dropbox, totaling\\nover an exabyte (more than 1,000,000,000 gigabytes) of data. When users join Dropbox, they gain access to a digital workspace that supports the full content lifecycle—they can create and organize their content, access it from anywhere, share it\\nwith internal and external collaborators, and review feedback and history.•Global sharing network.We’ve built one of the largest collaboration platforms in the world, with more than 4.5\\xa0billion connections to shared content. We cater to the needs of dynamic, dispersed teams.\\nThe overwhelming majority of our customers use Dropbox to share and collaborate. As we continue to grow, more users benefit from frictionless sharing, and powerful network effects increase the utility and stickiness of our\\nplatform.•New product experiences.The insights we glean from our community of users lead us to develop new product experiences, like Paper, Smart Sync, and Showcase. Machine learning further improves the user experience\\nby enabling more intelligent search and better organization and utility of information. This ongoing innovation broadens the value of our platform and deepens user engagement.These elements reinforce one another to produce a powerful flywheel effect. As users create and share more content with more people, they\\nexpand our global sharing network. This network allows us to gather insights and feedback that help us create new product experiences. And with our scale, we can instantly put these innovations in the hands of millions. This, in turn, helps attract\\nmore users and content, which further propels the flywheel.Our Growth StrategyIncrease adoption and paid conversionWe designed Dropbox to be easy to try, use, and buy. Anyone can create an account and be up and running in minutes. We believe that our current\\nregistered user base represents a significant opportunity to increase our94Table of Contentsrevenue. We estimate that approximately 300 million of our registered users have characteristics—including specific email domains, devices, and geographies—that make them more likely\\nthan other registered users to pay over time. Substantially all of our paying users share at least one of these characteristics. We reach our users throughin-productnotifications on our website and across\\nhundreds of millions of actively connected devices, without any external marketing spend. We define an actively connected device as a desktop, laptop, phone, or tablet on which our app has been installed, and from which our app has been launched,\\nand made a request to our servers at least once in the most recent quarter.Upgrade our paying usersWe offer a range of paid subscription plans, from Plus and Professional for individuals to Standard, Advanced, and Enterprise for teams. We\\nanalyze usage patterns within our network and run hundreds of targeted marketing campaigns to encourage paying users to upgrade their plans. For example, we prompt individual subscribers who collaborate with others on Dropbox to purchase our\\nStandard or Advanced plans for a better team experience. In 2017, over 40% of new Dropbox Business teams included a member who was previously a subscriber to one of our individual paid plans. We believe that a large majority of individual customers\\nuse Dropbox for work, which creates an opportunity to significantly increase conversion to Dropbox Business team offerings over time.Apply insights to build new product experiencesAs our community of users grows, we gain more insight into their needs and pain points. We translate these insights into new product\\nexperiences that support the entire content lifecycle. For example, we learned through analytics and research that our users often work with many different types of content. As a result, we added the ability to embed rich media in Paper so they can\\npull everything together in one place—from InVision graphics and Google slides to Spotify tracks and Vimeo clips.Expand our\\necosystemOur open and thriving ecosystem fosters deeper relationships with our users and makes Dropbox more valuable to them over\\ntime. The scale and reach of our platform is enhanced by a number of third-party applications, developers, and technology partners. As of December 31, 2017, Dropbox was receiving over 50\\xa0billion API calls per month, and more than 500,000\\ndevelopers had registered and built applications on our platform.Our Market OpportunityOver the past decade, Dropbox has pioneered the worldwide adoption of file sync and share software. We’ve since expanded our capabilities\\nand introduced new product experiences to help our users get work done. For the second consecutive year, Gartner has named Dropbox a leader in their Magic Quadrant for Content Collaboration Platforms.Our addressable market includes collaborative applications, content management, project and portfolio management, and public cloud storage.\\nIDC estimates that investment in these categories will total more than $50\\xa0billion in 2019.As one of the few large-scale\\ncollaboration platforms that serves customers of all sizes, we also have an opportunity to reach a broad population of independent knowledge and creative workers. We believe that this market hasn’t traditionally been included in IT spending\\nestimates.Our CapabilitiesDropbox\\nis a digital workspace where individuals and teams can create content, access it from anywhere, and share it with collaborators. The power of our platform lies in the breadth of our capabilities and the diverse95Table of Contentsways our users make Dropbox work for them. We monetize through a range of subscription plans. Our platform capabilities are described below:The Dropbox Collaboration Platform Access and organize Home\\nSearch Previews Smart Sync Version history Third-party ecosystem Share Folders Shared links Showcase File requests Create Paper Mobile doc scanner Collaborate Paper Comments and annotations File activity stream Notifications Viewer info and presence\\nSecure Administrator controls File recovery Encryption Third-party security integrations96Table of ContentsCreatePaper. We introduced Paper in January 2017 as a collaborative surface to bring people and ideas together. With Paper, users canco-authorcontent, tag others, assign tasks with due dates, embed and comment on files, tables, checklists, code snippets, and rich media—all in real-time. We designed Paper to be simple and beautiful so users\\ncan focus on the most important ideas and tasks at hand.97Table of ContentsDoc scanner. The doc scanner in our mobile app lets users create content in Dropbox\\nfrom hard copies. This includes transforming everything from printed materials to whiteboard brainstorming sessions into digital documents that users can edit and share. We apply proprietary machine learning techniques to automatically detect the\\ndocument being scanned, extract it from the background, fit it to a rectangular shape, remove shadows, adjust the contrast, and save it as a PDF or image file. For Dropbox Business teams, scanned content is analyzed using Optical Character\\nRecognition so text within these scans is searchable in Dropbox.98Table of ContentsAccess and organizeSearch. Dropbox has powerful search capabilities that allow users to quickly find the files and folders they need. Our autocomplete\\ntechnology surfaces and prioritizes content based on users’ previous activity. For Dropbox Professional subscribers and Dropbox Business teams, full text search allows users to scan the entire content of their files.Rich previews. Rich previews allow users to easily interact with files across any device without\\nhaving to open different applications. Users can comment on, annotate, review, and present files, and see who viewed and edited them. We support previews of over 280 file types, and Dropbox users currently preview files tens of millions of times\\nevery day.99Table of ContentsSmart Sync. With Smart Sync, users can access all of their content natively on their\\ncomputers without taking up storage space on their local hard drives. We intelligently sync files to a user’s computer as they need them, and users can control which files or folders are always synced locally. With Smart Sync, files that are\\nonly stored in the cloud appear in the local file system and can be opened directly from Windows File Explorer or Mac Finder, instead of having to navigate to our web interface. Smart Sync is available to Dropbox Professional subscribers and Dropbox\\nBusiness teams.Version history. As paying users work on files, our servers keep snapshots of all their changes.\\nUsers can see a file’s complete version history so they can reference and retrieve older versions if needed. Version histories are kept between 30 to 120 days for paying users, depending on subscription plan.Third-party ecosystem. Our open and thriving ecosystem fosters deeper relationships with our users and developers. Developers can build\\napplications that connect to Dropbox through our DBX Developer Platform. For example, email apps can plug into Dropbox to send attachments or shared links, and note-taking apps can allow users to save to Dropbox so they can open their notes on\\nanother device. As of December 31, 2017, Dropbox was receiving over 50\\xa0billion API calls per month and over 500,000 developers had registered and built applications on our platform. In addition, more than 75% of Dropbox Business teams have\\nlinked to one or more third-party applications.ShareFolders. There are three types of folders in Dropbox: private, shared, and team folders. A private folder allows an individual to sync\\nfiles between devices. A shared folder allows users to quickly and easily start a project space for group collaboration. A team folder, which is only available for Dropbox Business teams, is a central, administrator-managed hub where they can store\\nand collaborate on content.100Table of ContentsShared links. Users can share files and folders with anyone, including non-Dropbox\\nusers, by creating a Dropbox link. Once created, the link can be sent through email, text, Facebook, Twitter, instant message, or other channels. The recipient can view the file with a rich preview or see all the files in a shared folder. Dropbox\\nProfessional subscribers and Dropbox Business teams can set passwords and expiration dates and specify whether recipients can comment on or download the files.Showcase. Showcase gives users a way to present their work to clients and business partners through a customizable, professionally\\nbranded webpage. Users can display visual previews of multiple files on the same page and add relevant context with introductory text and captions and an introduction. Showcase also lets users track how recipients engage with their content,\\nincluding analytics on who has viewed, commented, or downloaded content on a per-person and per-file basis.101Table of ContentsFile requests. With file requests, users can invite anyone to submit files into a specified Dropbox\\nfolder through a simple link—regardless of whether the recipient has a Dropbox account. File requests are ideal for tasks such as collecting bids from contractors or requesting submissions from coworkers and clients. All submitted files are\\norganized into a Dropbox folder that’s private to the requesting user.102Table of ContentsCollaborateComments and annotations. Dropbox comments and annotations marry content with the conversations and relevant context around it. Instead\\nof being scattered across separate silos, such as email and chat, the editing and development of content are tied to a file. Users can give feedback on specific parts of files through a rich, innovative overlay on our web and mobile platforms.File activity stream.An activity feed lives next to every file preview on our web interface,\\ntelling users what’s happening with a file. The feed shows when someone opens a file, edits a file, or shares a file.Notifications. We use real-time notifications across all our channels—web, desktop, email, and mobile—to keep usersup-to-dateon what’s happening with their work. Users can choose to be notified when someone opens, edits, shares, or comments on a file, or adds a file to their shared\\nfolders. These notifications keep collaborators in sync without having to open the file or doc.Viewer information and presence.\\nOn both file previews and Paper docs, Dropbox shows users in real-time who’s viewing a doc and when a doc was last viewed by other users. On desktop, the Dropbox badge is a subtle overlay to Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that lets users\\nknow if someone opens or edits the file they’re working in. The Dropbox badge gives users real-time insight into how others are interacting with their content, bringing modern collaboration features often found only inweb-baseddocuments to desktop files.SecureSecurity protections.We employ strong protections for all of the data on our platform.•Encryption. Dropbox file data at rest is encrypted using256-bitAdvanced Encryption Standard, or AES. To protect data in transit between Dropbox apps such as desktop, mobile, API, or web and our103Table of Contentsservers, Dropbox uses Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, and Transport Layer Security, or TLS, for data transfer, creating a secure tunnel protected by128-bitor higher AES encryption.•File recovery. Every deletion event in Dropbox is recorded, including when groups of files are deleted. Users can easily recover files through our web interface. Dropbox Plus subscribers may recover prior\\nversions for up to 30 days after deletion, and Dropbox Professional and Dropbox Business subscribers may recover prior versions for up to 120 days after deletion.Administrator controls. Dropbox Business team administrators have many ways to customize security settings in both global and granular\\nways.•Sharing permissions: Team administrators can set up and monitor how their members share team folders, and can set sharing permissions on all folders,sub-folders,and links\\nthrough the sharing tab.•Remote device wipe: Team administrators can delete their organization’s Dropbox content from a member’s linked devices, which is especially useful should someone lose a device or leave the team.•Audit log: Team administrators can monitor which members are sharing files and logging into Dropbox, among other events. They can review activity logs, create full reports for specific time ranges, and pull\\nactivity reports on specific members. Advanced and Enterprise team administrators have access to audit logs with file-event tracking.•Device approvals: Advanced and Enterprise team administrators can manage how members access Dropbox on their devices.•Tiered administrator roles: Advanced and Enterprise teams have the ability to set multiple administrator roles, each with a different set of permissions.•Network control: Enterprise team administrators can restrict personal Dropbox usage on their organization’s network.Third-party security integrations. We’ve partnered with industry-leading third parties\\nto enable us to provide a wide range of IT processes and satisfy industry compliance standards, including:•Security information and event management: Allows Dropbox Business administrators to oversee and manage employee activity, and access sensitive data through the administrator page.104Table of Contents•Data loss prevention: Protects sensitive data like personally identifiable information and payment card industry data stored in Dropbox Business accounts.•eDiscovery and legal hold: Enables secure search and the ability to collect and preserve electronically stored information in Dropbox Business accounts.•Digital rights management: Provides third-party encryption for company data stored in Dropbox Business accounts.•Data migration andon-premisesbackup: Assists in transferring large amounts of data between locations and securing sensitive information withon-sitedata backup.•Identity management: Allows companies to keep their Dropbox Business team authenticated with an external identity provider like Active Directory.105Table of ContentsOur Subscription PlansWe offer subscription plans to serve the varying needs of our diverse customer base, which includes individuals, teams, and organizations of\\nall sizes.Our CustomersWe’ve built a thriving global business with over 11\\xa0million paying users.

The company encourages its more than 20,000 employees in 72 offices worldwide to use technology they know and love. This presents a unique business challenge: how does a global\\nteam work well together when their tools do not? After learning that many employees already relied on Dropbox to coordinate on projects, Expedia purchased 10,000 Dropbox Business licenses in 2015. It was an easy transition: the platform required\\nlittle or no training, and Dropbox integrated seamlessly with the wide array of platforms and apps the business ran on—a key reason why so many Expedians had already adopted Dropbox. After just one month of deployment, the number of shared\\nDropbox folders increased six-fold and the number of mobile devices connected to Dropbox doubled, supporting greater productivity for employees as they traveled. Expedia also saved on IT costs as their workflows moved to the cloud. “A lot of\\ntimes when we deploy software, we first hear about the challenges. But during our phased deployment of Dropbox Business, we mostly just heard employees saying, ‘Can I get that now?’” Chris Burgess Vice President of Information\\nTechnology Expedia Group108Table of ContentsExpedia109Table of Contents110Golden State Warriors The defending NBA champions are known for their innovative thinking and teamwork on and off the court.\\nPart of the Warriors’ organizational philosophy is to break down communication barriers, but their existing tools weren’t maximizing efficiency. Ease of use, security, and seamless on-boarding were among the deciding factors in adopting\\nDropbox. The IT team also loves that Smart Sync frees up hard drive space, allowing for leaner hardware choices. After starting with 15 Dropbox Business licenses in 2013, today the Warriors have requested 450 Business licenses to keep up with user\\ndemand. The Warriors use Dropbox across the organization. Basketball operations and analytics departments share scouting videos, “heat maps” that show where a player is most successful on the court, and complex models in Excel to ensure\\nthey’re keeping their competitive edge. As the Warriors prepare for their move to Chase Center in 2019, designers, architects, and engineers collaborate on CAD file schematics in Dropbox. The Warriors say that using Dropbox helps keep them\\nahead of the curve in their industry. “The beauty of Dropbox is that it lets us collaborate across any team, from any location. We owe a lot of our success to how well our organization works together, and Dropbox is right there at the top of\\nthe list of reasons why.” Chip Bowers Chief Marketing Officer Golden State WarriorsTable of Contents111Golden State WarriorsTable of Contents112Les Lune Les Lunes is a fashion and apparel company. Designers in Paris and Los Angeles, manufacturers in Shanghai, and\\nbusiness teams in San Francisco and New York collaborate to make clothing out of sustainable bamboo fabrics. As the company grew from three employees to 20, Les Lunes adopted Dropbox Business in 2013 to centralize their workflow. Les Lunes’\\nentire product development process now happens in Dropbox Paper. Designers use it to iterate on sketches in real time, while store managers comment in the same document to relay customer feedback. Employees track everything from vendor deliveries to\\nlogo approvals with Paper’s task management and deadline features. To date, Les Lunes has used Paper to design 10 clothing lines and plan six new store and showroom openings. Since adopting Dropbox, Les Lunes has also saved around $200,000 a\\nyear on infrastructure, including costs associated with laptops, on-premise storage systems, security software, file servers, IT personnel, and competing SaaS solutions. “Dropbox Paper is our new best friend. It has eliminated long email chains\\nand really enabled us to communicate better as a team—it saves us hours of work on every project.” Tobe Sheldon Regional Manager Les LunesTable of ContentsLes Lunes113Table of ContentsBrandt Brandt is a large mechanical, electrical, and plumbing\\ncontractor that services facilities like schools and hospitals across Texas. Before adopting Dropbox, Brandt’s field technicians relied on paperwork, scanners, printers, and fax machines to communicate with their company headquarters and\\ncustomers. In 2014, Brandt purchased 120 Dropbox Business licenses and deployed them on tablets for technicians on job sites to update forms and work orders in shared Dropbox folders. Brandt also integrated its own digital signature app with Dropbox\\nto make the process even easier. Signed forms save automatically to the appropriate Dropbox shared folder, which notifies the approving supervisor. Brandt has since expanded its deployment to 250 Dropbox Business licenses, and estimates that each\\nfield technician saves up to one hour per service call on document processing. With 120 technicians each completing two service calls per day on average, Brandt calculates savings of $400,000 per year—or more than three times the annual cost of\\nthe company’s Dropbox Business subscription. “Our technicians are more efficient, our customers are getting what they need more quickly, and we are delivering to the bottom line in ways that were unforeseeable when we began this\\nprocess.” Jim Stagg Vice President of Service Brandt114Table of ContentsBrandt115Table of ContentsMaple Hill Creamery is the pioneer in organic 100% grass-fed\\ndairy products with top-selling items in stores across the U.S. As the company grew to include 150 organic dairy farms across the state of New York, and remote teams across the country, they needed a more sustainable and centralized way to share\\ninformation than email and personal Dropbox accounts. In 2015, Maple Hill upgraded to Dropbox Business—a decision they now describe as “priceless.” By creating shared folders with each of their team members and departments, Maple Hill\\nmanages contracts, organic certificates, and other key documents without having to track down email attachments. Salespeople use shared folders to access product summaries, distributor profiles, and other marketing assets. With the Dropbox badge,\\nemployees keep tabs on milk flow as production from 150 farms is updated to reflect expected volumes in Excel spreadsheets. By making it easy to coordinate with distributors and eliminating the need to maintain file servers, Dropbox has helped Maple\\nHill keep IT costs low as they’ve expanded into the dairy aisles of more than 6,000 stores. “We’re able to do things you could do in the past only with a full-fledged IT department. So Dropbox keeps us very small and nimble.” Tim\\nJoseph Founder116Table of ContentsMaple Hill Creamery117Table of Contents118World Bicycle Relief World Bicycle Relief (WBR) was founded in the aftermath of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\\nCo-founders F.K. Day and Leah Missbach Day saw how bicycles helped the people who had been relocated from their homes, schools, and places of work to get moving again. The nonprofit designs, manufactures, and delivers durable bicycles to developing\\ncountries where typically available, low-quality bikes often fall apart in these rugged, rural conditions. Operating on a limited budget, WBR needed a better way to centralize collaboration among employees on four continents who often needed to\\nshare large files. In 2015, WBR decided to buy 50 Dropbox Business licenses because many of its employees were already familiar with the product. Employees in Chicago and Europe use Dropbox to share design files with manufacturers in Taiwan and\\ndistribute product manuals with field teams in Africa, who then assemble the bicycles. The platform’s reliable performance in low-bandwidth environments has allowed WBR to effectively manage its supply chain communications and product orders,\\nenabling the nonprofit to put more bicycles in the hands of people who need them. To date, WBR has delivered over 350,000 Buffalo Bicycles in 19 countries. “Our investments in technology are a key reason we’ve been able to scale our\\nefforts, and Dropbox is right at the top of the list of tools we use every day.” Ruth-Anne Renaud Director of Global Marketing World Bicycle ReliefTable of Contents119World Bicycle ReliefTable of ContentsOur Sales and Marketing ApproachAs users share content and collaborate on our platform, they introduce and invite new users, driving viral growth. We generate 90% of our\\nrevenue from self-serve channels, which reduces customer acquisition costs.We’ve developed an efficient marketing function\\nthat’s focused on building brand awareness and reinforcing our self-serve model. Our goal is to rapidly demonstrate the value of our platform to our users in order to convert them to paying users and upgrade them to our premium offerings. We\\nreach them throughin-productprompts and notifications, time-limited trials of paid subscription plans, email, and lifecycle marketing. During the fourth quarter of 2017, hundreds of millions of\\ndevices—including computers, phones, and tablets—were actively connected to the Dropbox platform, representing a large number of touchpoints to communicate with our users.We complement our self-serve strategy with a focused outbound sales effort targeted at organizations with existing organic adoption of\\nDropbox. Once prospects are identified, our sales team works to broaden adoption of our platform into wider-scale deployments. We also acquire some users through paid marketing and distribution partnerships in which hardware manufacturerspre-installour software on their devices.Our Technology Infrastructure and OperationsOur users trust us with their most important content, and we focus on providing them with a secure andeasy-to-useplatform. More than 90% of our users’ data is stored on our own custom-built infrastructure, which has been designed from the ground up to be reliable and secure, and to provide annual data\\ndurability of at least 99.999999999%. We have datacenterco-locationfacilities in California, Texas, and Virginia.We also utilize Amazon Web Services, or AWS, for the remainder of our users’ storage needs and to help deliver our services. These AWS\\ndatacenters are located in the United States and Europe, which allows us to localize where content is stored. Our technology infrastructure, combined with select use of AWS resources, provides us with a distributed and scalable architecture on a\\nglobal scale.We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability.\\nIncremental backups are performed hourly and full backups are performed daily. In addition, as a default, redundant copies of content are stored independently in at least two separate geographic regions and replicated reliably within each region.Our Research and Development ApproachWe invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our platform, develop new products and features, and improve our\\ninfrastructure.Our research and development organization consists of world-class engineering, product, and design teams. As of December\\n31, 2017, we had more than 870 professionals across these teams, representing approximately 47% of our full-time employees. They have a diverse set of skills and industry experience, including expertise in massively distributed systems and\\nuser-centric application engineering.Our engineering, product, and design teams work together to bring our products to life, from\\nconception and validation to implementation. We continually improve our existing products, update them to work with the latest platforms and technologies, and launch new and innovative products and features.120Table of ContentsOur ValuesSince our founding, we’ve focused on building a culture of innovation and teamwork. As our company grew, we developed five core values\\nthat are critical to our success. Our values are a compass and part of everyday life for Dropboxers. Each one guides how we treat each other and our users.•Be worthy of trustTake care of each other and our users, and keep their best\\ninterests at heart.Millions of people and businesses trust us to safeguard their most important information. We strive to be as transparent as possible with them and each other.•Sweat the detailsObsess over quality and strive to master your craft.We\\nbelieve that truly insightful solutions emerge from a deep understanding of problems and a dedication to iteration. We push ourselves (and each other) to get to the root of problems, and we don’t accept sloppy solutions or band-aids.•Aim higherSet audacious goals.We believe in taking risks and being\\nwilling to disrupt ourselves, so we don’t squander an opportunity to build something much bigger. With the density of incredible talent at Dropbox and the size of the opportunity in front of us, we owe it to each other to push limits.•We, not IWe’re a village, and as members, we each need to do our part\\nfor the village to thrive.We tackle a never-ending stream of people, product, and business challenges, many of which are far too hard to be solved by a single person or team. We believe in people really knowing each other and in putting the\\nwelfare of the company and our users before ourselves.•Surprise and delight each other and our users.Cupcake is about adding an authentic, human touch to\\neverything we do. But more than that, it’s about finding creative ways to make our users (and each other) smile—whether it’s our quirky illustrations, or bringing a roving ice cream cart to the office to celebrate a product launch. We\\nbelieve that the magic we create together as Dropboxers translates into magic for our users.Our EmployeesAs of December 31, 2017, we had 1,858 full-time employees. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by\\na labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.Our Commitment to Security and\\nPrivacyTrust is the foundation of our relationship with our users, and we take significant measures every day to protect their\\nprivacy and security.SecurityOur sophisticated infrastructure is designed to protect our users’ content while it is transferred, stored, and processed. We offer\\nmultiple layers of protection, including secure file data transfer, encryption, network configuration, and application-level controls. For Dropbox Business teams, our tools also empower121Table of Contentsadministrators with control and visibility features that allow them to customize our platform to their organizations’ needs. Our information security policies and management framework are\\ndesigned to build a culture of security, and we continually assess risks and improve the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our systems.We voluntarily engage third-party security auditors to test our systems and controls at least annually against the most widely recognized\\nsecurity standards and regulations. Our Dropbox Trust Program consists of key infrastructure processes such as change management, access control, security management, and human resource management. Our program also serves as an Information Security\\nManagement System, or ISMS, as prescribed by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, and the International Electrotechnical Commission 27001:2013 international information security standard. It also qualifies as a Business\\nContinuity Management System, or BCMS, as prescribed by the ISO 22301:2012 international business continuity standard.The ISO has\\ndeveloped a series of standards for information security and related areas. We’ve received the following ISO certifications:•ISO 27001 (Information Security Management)•ISO 27017 (Cloud Security)•ISO 27018 (Cloud Privacy and Data Protection)•ISO 22301 (Business Continuity Management)We’ve also completed a SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC\\n3 examination. Service Organization Controls, or SOC, are standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for reporting on internal control environments implemented within an organization. Our datacenter facilities\\nand services providers also regularly undergo ISO 27001, SOC 1, and/or SOC 2 audits to verify their security practices. The ISO 27001 security standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing,\\nmaintaining, and improving a documented Information Security Management System within the context of the organization’s overall business risks. This standard addresses confidentiality, access control, vulnerability, and risk assessment.In addition, we have CSA STAR Level\\xa01 and Level\\xa02 certifications from the Cloud Security Alliance, or CSA, a security assurance\\nprogram for cloud services. CSA Security, Trust\\xa0& Assurance Registry, or STAR, is a free, publicly-accessible registry that offers a security assurance program for cloud services, helping users assess the security posture of cloud providers\\nthey currently use or are considering contracting with. CSA STAR Level\\xa02 Certification requires a third-party independent assessment of our security controls based on the requirements of ISO 27001 and the CSA Cloud Controls Matrix, or CCM,\\nv.3.0.1, a set of criteria that measures the capability levels of cloud services. The CSA STAR Level\\xa01 Self-Assessment is a rigorous survey based on CSA’s Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire, which aligns with the CCM, and\\nprovides answers to almost 300 questions a cloud customer or a cloud security auditor may ask. We’re also listed in the UK Digital Marketplace for government cloud services procurement under the current framework, known asG-Cloud9.Dropbox supports HIPAA and HITECH compliance. We sign business associate agreements with our\\ncustomers who require them in order to comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH. We also offer a HIPAA assessment report\\nperformed by an independent third party.PrivacyWe’re committed to keeping user data private. Our privacy policy details how users’ information is protected and the steps we take to\\nprotect it. Dropbox also has terms and guidelines for third-party developers to create applications that connect to Dropbox while respecting user privacy. Dropbox is certified under theEU-U.S.andSwiss-U.S.Privacy Shield and is working towards compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, framework.122Table of ContentsWe believe in transparency with our users and have adopted guiding principles regarding how\\nwe handle requests from government and law enforcement agencies seeking information about our users and their content. These guiding principles are:•Be transparent•We believe that online services should be allowed to publish the number and types of government requests they receive, and to notify individuals when information about them has been requested. We’ll continue to\\npublish detailed information about these requests and advocate for the right to provide more information.•Fight overly broad requests•We believe that government data requests should be limited in the information they seek and narrowly tailored to specific people and legitimate investigations. We’ll resist blanket and overly broad requests.•Provide trusted services•We believe that governments should never install backdoors into online services or compromise infrastructure to obtain user data. We’ll continue to work to protect our systems and to change laws to make it clear\\nthat this type of activity is illegal.•Protect all users•We believe that laws that give people different protections based on where they live or their citizenship are antiquated and don’t reflect the global nature of online services. We’re committed to providing the\\nsame level of protection to all of our users. That means that we use our guiding principles to scrutinize all the requests we receive, regardless of the origin of the request or user.Our CompetitionThe market for content\\ncollaboration platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain features of our platform compete in the cloud storage market with products offered by Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft, and in the content collaboration market with products\\noffered by Atlassian, Google, and Microsoft. We compete with Box on a more limited basis in the cloud storage market for deployments by large enterprises. We also compete with smaller private companies that offer point solutions in the cloud storage\\nmarket or the content collaboration market.We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:•user-centric design;•ease of adoption and use;•scale of user network;•features and platform experience;•performance;•brand;•security and privacy;•accessibility across several devices, operating systems, and applications;•third-party integration;•customer support;123Table of Contents•continued innovation; and•pricing.We believe we compete favorably across these factors and are largely unhindered by\\nlegacy constraints. However, some of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services, the ability to bundle a broader range of products and services, larger marketing budgets, established marketing\\nrelationships, access to larger user bases, major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers, and greater financial, technical, and other resources.Intellectual PropertyWe believe that\\nour intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets,know-howlicense agreements, confidentiality\\nprocedures,non-disclosureagreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, from time to time\\nwe’ve purchased patents, inbound licenses, trademarks, domain names, and patent applications from third parties.We have over 600\\nissued patents and more than 600 pending patent applications in the United States and abroad. These patents and patent applications seek to protect our proprietary inventions relevant to our business. In addition, we have a large number of inbound\\nlicenses to key patents in the file collaboration, storage, syncing, and sharing markets.We have trademark rights in our name, our logo,\\nand other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the United States and many other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.dropbox.com,\\nand similar variations.We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial\\nand cost effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries where our products\\nare distributed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.Legal ProceedingsWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary\\ncourse of business, including legal proceedings with third parties asserting infringement of their intellectual property rights. For example, in April 2015, Synchronoss Technologies, Inc., a public company that provides cloud-based products, filed a\\npatent infringement lawsuit against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, claiming three counts of patent infringement and seeking injunctive relief. The case was subsequently transferred to the United States\\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of California. We do not currently believe that this matter is likely to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or our financial position, and we intend to\\nvigorously defend this lawsuit, and believe we have valid defenses to the claims. However, any litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely\\nimpact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.Future litigation may be necessary, among other things,\\nto defend ourselves or our users by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and\\nregardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.124Table of ContentsOur FacilitiesOur corporate headquarters is located in San Francisco, California, pursuant to operating leases that expire in 2033. We lease additional\\noffices in San Francisco and around the world, including in Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; New York, New York; Dublin, Ireland; London, United Kingdom; Tel Aviv, Israel; Sydney, Australia; and Tokyo, Japan. We have datacenterco-locationfacilities in California, Texas, and Virginia.

Rice and Whitman were elected as the designees nominated by holders of our common stock, excluding the common stock issued upon conversion of our\\nconvertible preferred stock; and•Mr.\\xa0Schreier was elected as the preferred stock designee nominated by entities affiliated with Sequoia Capital.Our amended and restated voting agreement will terminate and the provisions of our current certificate of incorporation by which our directors\\nwere elected will be amended and restated in connection with this offering.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that, immediately after the completion of this offering, our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. Only one class of\\ndirectors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Our current directors will be divided among the three classes as follows:•the Class\\xa0I directors will be \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, and \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\nand their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019;•the Class\\xa0II directors will be \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, and \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\nand their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020; and•the Class\\xa0III directors will be \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 and\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2021.Each director’s term will continue until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or his or her earlier\\ndeath, resignation, or removal. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist ofone-thirdof our\\ndirectors.This classification of our Board of Directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company.Director IndependenceOur Board of\\nDirectors has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board of Directors129Table of Contentshas determined that Mmes. Rice and Whitman and Messrs. Blair, Jacobs, Mylod, and Schreier do not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out\\nthe responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the listing standards of Nasdaq. In making these determinations, our Board of Directors considered the current and prior\\nrelationships that eachnon-employeedirector has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial\\nownership of our capital stock by eachnon-employeedirector, and the transactions involving them described in the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”Lead Independent DirectorOur Board of\\nDirectors intends to adopt corporate governance guidelines that will provide that one of our independent directors should serve as our Lead Independent Director at any time when our Chief Executive Officer serves as the Chairman of our Board of\\nDirectors or if the Chairman is not otherwise independent. Because Andrew W. Houston is our Chairman and is not an “independent” director as defined in the listing standards of Nasdaq, our Board of Directors has appointed\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 to serve as our Lead Independent Director.

In determining the size and terms of these awards, our Board of Directors considered such\\nfactors as it determined appropriate, including, the vested status of each of these non-employee director’s current company equity awards, the compensation level of directors at comparable companies, the expected timing of the issuance of\\nfuture equity awards to them under the director compensation policy described below, and the past and expected future contributions of these directors to our company.•Ms. Rice and Messrs. Jacobs, Mylod, and Schreier: an award of RSUs with a value of $300,000 that vests on May 15, 2019 or the next annual meeting of our stockholders, if earlier, subject to the director’s continued\\nservice with us. The award will be subject to vesting acceleration on a “change in control”, as set forth in our director compensation policy described below. The award will be effective as of immediately prior to the effectiveness of our\\nregistration statement related to this offering, subject to their approval by our stockholders and the director’s continued service with us. The number of RSUs subject to the award shall equal $300,000 divided by the per share price of Class A\\ncommon stock listed on the cover of the registration statement related to this offering.•Mr. Blair: an award of 80,000 RSUs that vests in two equal installments on November 15, 2018 and November 15, 2019, subject to his continued service with us. The award will be subject to vesting acceleration on a\\n“change in control”, as set forth in our director compensation policy described below. This award was provided to Mr. Blair as part of his recruitment to join our Board of Directors.Prior to this offering, we did not have a formal policy with respect to compensation payable to ournon-employeedirectors for service as directors. From time to time, we have granted equity awards to certainnon-employeedirectors to entice them to join our Board of\\nDirectors and for their continued service on our Board of Directors. We also have reimbursed our directors for expenses associated with attending meetings of our Board of Directors and committees of our Board of Directors. In February 2018, our\\nBoard of Directors adopted a new compensation policy for our non-employee directors that will be effective as of the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement related to this offering. This policy was developed, with input from our\\nindependent compensation consultant firm, Compensia, Inc., regarding practices and compensation level at comparable companies. It is designed to attract, retain, and reward non-employee directors.Under this director compensation policy, each non-employee director will receive the cash and equity compensation for board services described\\nbelow. We also will continue to reimburse our non-employee directors for reasonable, customary, and documented travel expenses to board meetings.The director compensation policy includes a maximum annual limit of $1,200,000 of cash compensation and equity awards that may be paid,\\nissued, or granted to a non-employee director in any fiscal year. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP). Any cash compensation paid or equity awards\\ngranted to a person for his or her services as an employee, or for his or her services as a consultant (other than as a non-employee director), will not count for purposes of the limitation. The maximum limit does not reflect the intended size of\\nany potential compensation or equity awards to our non-employee directors.133Table of ContentsCash CompensationFollowing the completion of this offering, non-employee directors will be entitled to receive the following cash compensation for their\\nservices:•$50,000 per year for service as a board member;•$20,000 per year for service as a lead independent director;•$25,000 per year for service as chair of the audit committee;•$12,500 per year for service as a member of the audit committee;•$20,000 per year for service as chair of the compensation committee;•$10,000 per year for service as a member of the compensation committee;•$10,000 per year for service as chair of the nominating and governance committee; and•$5,000 per year for service as a member of the nominating and governance committee.Each\\nnon-employee director who serves as the chair of a committee will receive both the additional annual fee as the chair of the committee and the additional annual fee as a member of the committee. All cash payments to non-employee directors are paid\\nquarterly in arrears on a prorated basis.Equity CompensationInitial Award.Each person who first becomes a non-employee director will receive, on the first trading date on or after the date on\\nwhich the person first becomes an non-employee director, an initial award of RSUs, or the Initial Award, covering a number of shares of our Class A common stock having a grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP) equal to $300,000\\nmultiplied by the fraction obtained by dividing (1) the number of full months during the period beginning on the date the person first becomes a non-employee director and ending on the one-year anniversary of the date of the then-most recent annual\\nmeeting of the company’s stockholders, or the Initial Award Vesting Period by (2) 12, rounded to the nearest whole share. The Initial Award will vest on the last day of the Initial Award Vesting Period or, if earlier, on the day before the\\nannual meeting of our stockholders that follows the grant date of the Initial Award, subject to the non-employee director continuing to provide services to us through the applicable vesting date. If the person was a member of the Board of Directors\\nand also an employee, becoming a non-employee director due to termination of employment will not entitle the non-employee director to an Initial Award.Annual Award.Each non-employee director automatically will receive, on the date of each annual meeting of the Company’s\\nstockholders following the effective date of the policy, an annual award of RSUs, each of which we refer to as an Annual Award, covering a number of shares of our Class A common stock having a grant date fair value (determined in accordance with\\nGAAP) of $300,000, rounded to the nearest whole share. The Annual Award will vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date of the Annual Award or, if earlier, the day before our annual meeting of stockholders that follows the grant date of the\\nAnnual Award, subject to the non-employee director continuing to provide services to us through the applicable vesting dateIn the event\\nof a “change in control” (as defined in our 2018 Plan), each non-employee director will fully vest in his or her outstanding company equity awards, including any Initial Award or Annual Award, provided that the non-employee director\\ncontinues to be a non-employee director through such date.134Table of ContentsEXECUTIVE COMPENSATIONSummary Compensation TableOur named\\nexecutive officers, consisting of our principal executive officer and the next two most highly compensated executive officers, as of December\\xa031, 2017, were:•Andrew W.

Our Board of Directors135Table of Contentsretains the discretion to increase or decrease the cash bonus pool under the 2017 Bonus Plan based on our achievements of those corporate financial performance measures in 2017. In addition, the\\nactual bonus amount payable under the 2017 Bonus Plan may be modified based on individual performance for 2017.Following the end of\\n2017, our compensation committee reviewed our achievements against the revenue and free cash flow corporate financial performance measures and determined that we exceeded target levels of achievement for each of these performance measures.\\nAccordingly, the annual bonus payment for each of our named executive officers was calculated based on 100% of his target bonus amount, which is described under “—Executive Employment Arrangements.” Mr. Clark’s amount is\\npro-rated based on his length of service with us in 2017.

The Co-Founder Grants vest upon the satisfaction of the service condition and achievement of certain stock price goals, as described below.

The Board of Directors thought it was important for\\nthe Co-Founder Grants to not simply vest based on the passage of time while our co-founders provide service to us. Rather, the Co-Founder Grants will vest only if we achieve certain stock price goals, which if achieved, would allow our other\\nstockholders to benefit tremendously from such increases in our stock price.136Table of ContentsThe Co-Founder Grants are eligible to vest over the ten-year period following the closing of\\nthis offering. The Co-Founder Grants comprise nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, or each, a Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive thirty-day trading period during the performance period\\nas follows:Company\\xa0Stock\\xa0PriceTarget*Shares\\xa0Eligible\\xa0to\\xa0Vest\\xa0forMr.\\xa0HoustonShares\\xa0Eligible\\xa0to\\xa0Vestfor Mr.\\xa0Ferdowsi1.$20.003,100,0001,320,0002.$25.001,550,000660,0003.$30.001,550,000660,0004.$35.001,550,000660,0005.$40.001,550,000660,0006.$45.001,550,000660,0007.$50.001,550,000660,0008.$55.001,550,000660,0009.$60.001,550,000660,000Measurement of our stock price for purposes of achievement of the Stock Price Targets will not commence until\\nthe later of the expiration of the lock-up period following the completion of this offering or January 1, 2019. In addition, the Stock Price Targets will be adjusted to reflect any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, reorganizations,\\nreclassifications, or similar event.During the first four years of the performance period, no more than 20% of the shares subject to\\neachCo-FounderGrant would be eligible to vest in any calendar year. This ensures that to fully vest in theCo-FounderGrants, any increase in our stock price must be\\nsustained over a long period of time and not allow any short-term, unsustained increases in our stock price to result in a vesting event for either co-founder.Further, the co-founders will only vest in the awards if they continue as the Chief Executive Officer or Executive Chairman, with respect to\\nMr. Houston, and as a member of the senior management team, with respect to Mr.\\xa0Ferdowsi, or the Executive Service Requirement, at the time a Stock Price Target is achieved. Upon a co-founder’s no longer satisfying the Executive Service\\nRequirement, any portion of the Co-Founder Grant for which a Stock Price Target has not been achieved would terminate and be cancelled. By requiring that each continue in a senior executive role with us as a condition to vesting, the Board of\\nDirectors sought to ensure that each must be providing significant contributions to us that drive any future growth that would allow theCo-FounderGrants to vest.Lastly, the Board of Directors considered the impact these grants would have on the co-founders’ voting control of the Company. The Board\\nof Directors determined that it was in our and our stockholders’ best interests to issue the Co-Founder Grants because the receipt of the Co-Founder Grants would not materially impact the voting control of the Company, but would still provide\\nthe co-founders with meaningful incentives as described above, and thereby align their interests with those of our other stockholders.In\\nthe event of an acquisition of the Company following the closing of this offering, but before the end of the performance period, the Co-Founder Grants may be eligible to vest in additional tranche(s) of shares if the per share deal price in the\\nacquisition causes a Stock Price Target that has not previously been achieved to be satisfied, in which case the tranche(s) of shares corresponding to that Stock Price Target will vest. Additionally, if the acquisition price falls between a Stock\\nPrice Target that has been achieved and one that has not, then a portion of that tranche of shares will vest based on a linear interpolation between each of these Stock Price Targets.137Table of ContentsExecutive Employment ArrangementsAndrew W. HoustonPrior to the completion of this offering, we intend to enter into an employment letter with Andrew W. Houston, our Chief Executive Officer and\\none of our co-founders.

Each change in control and severance agreement will supersede any existing agreement or arrangement the named executive officers may have with us that provides for\\nseverance and/or change in control payments or benefits, except that the change in control and severance agreements with Messrs. Houston and Ferdowsi will not have any effect on the Co-Founder Grants.If the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by us other than for “cause,” death, or “disability” or he\\nresigns for “good reason” (as such terms are defined in his change in control and severance agreement), in either case, outside the Change in Control Period (as defined below), he will be eligible to receive the following payments and\\nbenefits:•a lump-sum payment equal to 50% of annual base salary as of immediately before his termination (or if the termination is due to a resignation for good reason based on a material reduction in base salary, then as of\\nimmediately before such reduction); and•if he elects to continue health insurance coverage for him and his eligible dependents under COBRA, our payment of the monthly premium for such COBRA continuation coverage for up to 6 months (or monthly taxable payments\\nto him in lieu of our payment of such premiums).If, within the three-month period before or after the 12-month period\\nfollowing a change in control (such period, the Change in Control Period), the named executive officer’s employment is terminated by us other than for cause, death, or disability or he resigns for “good reason” (as defined in his\\nchange in control and severance agreement), he will be entitled to the following benefits:•a lump-sum payment equal to 100% of his annual base salary as of immediately before his termination (or if the termination is due to a resignation for good reason based on a material reduction in base salary, then as of\\nimmediately before such reduction) or, if such amount is greater, as of immediately before the change in control;138Table of Contents•a lump-sum payment equal to 100% of his target annual bonus (for the year of his termination);•if he elects to continue health insurance coverage for him and his eligible dependents under COBRA, our payment of the monthly premium for such COBRA continuation coverage for up to 12 months (or monthly taxable\\npayments to him in lieu of our payment of such premiums); and•100% accelerated vesting of all outstanding equity awards, and, with respect to equity awards with performance-based vesting, unless otherwise specified in the award agreements governing such equity awards, all\\nperformance goals or other vesting criteria will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels.The receipt of the payments\\nand benefits above is conditioned on the named executive officer timely signing and not revoking a release of claims, returning all documents and property belonging to us, and resigning from all officer and director positions with us.In addition, if any of the payments or benefits provided for under a change in control and severance agreement or otherwise payable to a named\\nexecutive officer would constitute “parachute payments” within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code and could be subject to the related excise tax, the named executive officer would be entitled to receive either full\\npayment of such payments and benefits or such lesser amount that would result in no portion of the payments and benefits being subject to the excise tax, whichever results in the greater amount of after-tax benefits to him. The change in control and\\nseverance agreements do not require us to provide any tax gross-up payments to the named executive officers.Employee Benefits and Stock Plans2018 Equity Incentive PlanIn February 2018, our Board of Directors adopted, and we expect our stockholders will approve, our 2018 Plan. We expect that our 2018 Plan will\\nbe effective on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of our registration statement related to this offering. Our 2018 Plan will provide for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section\\xa0422 of the\\nInternal Revenue Code, or Code, to our employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares to our employees, directors, and\\nconsultants.Authorized shares. A total of 62,052,490 shares of our Class A common stock will be reserved for issuance pursuant to\\nour 2018 Plan. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under our 2018 Plan will also include (i)\\xa0shares that, as of the effective date of the registration statement relating to the offering, were reserved but unissued under our 2017 Plan\\nand are not subject to awards granted thereunder, plus (ii) Shares subject to stock options, restricted stock units, or similar awards granted under the 2017 Plan that, on or after the effective date of the registration statement relating to the\\noffering, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, are tendered to or withheld by us for payment of an exercise price or for tax withholding obligations, or are forfeited to or repurchased by us due to failure to vest,\\nplus (iii) a number of shares equal to the shares of the Class B common stock subject to stock options, restricted stock units, or similar awards granted under the 2008 Plan that, on or after the effective date of the registration statement relating\\nto the offering, expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full, are tendered to or withheld by us for payment of an exercise price or for tax withholding obligations (including, for the avoidance of doubt, shares withheld on or\\nafter the effective date of the registration statement relating to the offering, to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect to restricted stock units vesting on the effective date of the registration statement relating to the offering), or\\nare forfeited to or repurchased by us due to failure to vest, (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to our 2018 Plan from the Prior Plans under clauses (i) through (iii) is 103,237,285 shares). The number of shares of our\\nClass A common stock available for issuance under our 2018 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2019, equal to the least of:•62,052,490 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock;139Table of Contents•five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of our capital stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or•such other amount as our Board of Directors may determine.If an award expires or becomes\\nunexercisable without having been exercised in full, is surrendered pursuant to an exchange program, or, with respect to restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, or performance shares, is forfeited to or repurchased due to\\nfailure to vest, the unpurchased shares (or for awards other than stock options or stock appreciation rights, the forfeited or repurchased shares) will become available for future grant or sale under the 2018 Plan. With respect to stock appreciation\\nrights, only the net shares actually issued will cease to be available under the 2018 Plan and all remaining shares under stock appreciation rights will remain available for future grant or sale under the 2018 Plan. Shares that have actually been\\nissued under the 2018 Plan under any award will not be returned to the 2018 Plan; provided, however, that if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, or performance units are repurchased or\\nforfeited, such shares will become available for future grant under the 2018 Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under\\nthe 2018 Plan. To the extent an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not result in a reduction in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.Plan administration.Our Board of Directors or one or more committees appointed by our Board of Directors will administer our\\n2018 Plan. Our compensation committee is expected to administer our 2018 Plan. In addition, if we determine it is desirable to qualify transactions under our 2018 Plan as exempt under Rule16b-3of the\\nExchange Act, such transactions will be structured to satisfy the requirements for exemption under Rule16b-3.Subject to the provisions of our 2018 Plan, the administrator has the power to administer our 2018\\nPlan and make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the 2018 Plan, including but not limited to, the power to determine the fair market value of our Class\\xa0A common stock, select the service providers to whom awards\\nmay be granted, determine the number of shares covered by each award, approve forms of award agreements for use under the 2018 Plan, determine the terms and conditions of awards (including, but not limited to, the exercise price, the times or times\\nat which the awards may be exercised, any vesting acceleration or waiver or forfeiture restrictions, and any restriction or limitation regarding any award or the shares relating thereto), construe and interpret the terms of our 2018 Plan and awards\\ngranted under it, to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules relating to our 2018 Plan, including creatingsub-plans,and to modify or amend each award, including but not limited to the discretionary authority to\\nextend the post-termination exercisability period of awards (provided that no option or stock appreciation right will be extended past its original maximum term), and to allow a participant to defer the receipt of payment of cash or the delivery of\\nshares that would otherwise be due to such participant under an award. The administrator also has the authority to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the\\nadministrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered or cancelled in exchange for awards of the same type which may have a higher or lower exercise price and/or different terms, awards of a different type\\nand/or cash, or by which the exercise price of an outstanding award is increased or reduced. The administrator’s decisions, interpretations, and other actions are final and binding on all participants.Stock options.Stock options may be granted under our 2018 Plan. The exercise price of options granted under our 2018 Plan must\\nat least be equal to the fair market value of our Class\\xa0A common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed ten years. With respect to any participant who owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our\\noutstanding stock, the term of an incentive stock option granted to such participant must not exceed five years and the exercise price must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. The administrator will determine the methods\\nof payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares, or other property acceptable to the administrator, as well as other types of consideration permitted by applicable law. After the termination of service of an employee,\\ndirector, or140Table of Contentsconsultant, he or she may exercise his or her option for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if termination is due\\nto death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for 12 months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the option will remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. An\\noption may not be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of our 2018 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of options.Stock appreciation rights.Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2018 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the\\nrecipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our Class\\xa0A common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights may not have a term exceeding ten years. After the termination of service of\\nan employee, director, or consultant, he or she may exercise his or her stock appreciation right for the period of time stated in his or her stock appreciation rights agreement. In the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, if\\ntermination is due to death or disability, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for 12 months. In all other cases, in the absence of a specified time in an award agreement, the stock appreciation rights will remain exercisable for\\nthree months following the termination of service. However, in no event may a stock appreciation right be exercised later than the expiration of its term. Subject to the provisions of our 2018 Plan, the administrator determines the other terms of\\nstock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for\\nthe shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.Restricted stock.Restricted stock may be granted under our 2018 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator will determine the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director, or consultant and, subject to\\nthe provisions of our 2018 Plan, will determine the terms and conditions of such awards. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the\\nachievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock\\nawards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest are subject to our right of repurchase\\nor forfeiture.RSUs.RSUs may be granted under our 2018 Plan. Each RSU represents an amount equal to the fair market value\\nof one share of our Class\\xa0A common stock. Subject to the provisions of our 2018 Plan, the administrator determines the terms and conditions of RSUs, including the vesting criteria and the form and timing of payment. The administrator may set\\nvesting criteria based upon the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited to, continued employment or service), applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined\\nby the administrator in its discretion. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned restricted stock units in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole\\ndiscretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.Performance units and performance\\nshares.Performance units and performance shares may be granted under our 2018 Plan. Performance units and performance shares are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the\\nadministrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish performance objectives or other vesting criteria in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the\\nvalue of performance units and performance shares to be paid out to participants. The administrator may set performance objectives based on the achievement of company-wide, divisional, business unit, or individual goals (including, but not limited\\nto, continued employment or service), applicable federal or state securities laws, or any other basis determined by141Table of Contentsthe administrator in its discretion. After the grant of a performance unit or performance share, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance criteria or other\\nvesting provisions for such performance units or performance shares. Performance units shall have an initial dollar value established by the administrator on or prior to the grant date. Performance shares shall have an initial value equal to the\\nfair market value of our Class\\xa0A common stock on the grant date. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance units or performance shares in the form of cash, in shares, or in some combination thereof.Outside Directors.Our 2018 Plan includes a maximum annual limit of $1,200,000 of cash compensation and equity awards that may be paid,\\nissued, or granted to an outside (non-employee) director in any fiscal year. For purposes of this limitation, the value of equity awards is based on the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with GAAP). Any cash compensation paid or equity\\nawards granted to a person for his or her services as an employee, or for his or her services as a consultant (other than as a non-employee director), will not count for purposes of the limitation. The maximum limit does not reflect the intended\\nsize of any potential compensation or equity awards to our outside (non-employee) directors.Non-transferabilityof awards.Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2018\\nPlan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during his or her lifetime. If the administrator makes an award transferrable, such award will contain such additional terms and\\nconditions as the administrator deems appropriate.Certain adjustments.In the event of certain changes in our\\ncapitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under our 2018 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under our 2018 Plan and/or the number,\\nclass, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth in our 2018 Plan.Dissolution\\nor liquidation. In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.Merger or change in control.Our 2018 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under our\\n2018 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, without a requirement to obtain a participant’s consent. The administrator is not required to treat all awards, all awards held by a participant, or all awards\\nof the same type, similarly.In the event that a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an\\nequivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and\\nsuch award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction, unless specifically provided for otherwise under the applicable award agreement or other written agreement with the participant. The award will\\nthen terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. If an option or stock appreciation right is not assumed or substituted, the administrator will notify the participant in writing or electronically that such option or stock\\nappreciation right will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the administrator in its sole discretion and the option or stock appreciation right will terminate upon the expiration of such period.If an outside director’s awards are assumed or substituted for in a merger or change in control and the service of such outside director\\nis terminated on or following a change in control, other than pursuant to a voluntary resignation, his or her options and stock appreciation rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his or her\\nrestricted stock and restricted stock units will lapse and all performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance shares and units will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all other terms and conditions met.142Table of ContentsClawback.Awards will be subject to any clawback policy of ours, and the\\nadministrator also may specify in an award agreement that the participant’s rights, payments, and/or benefits with respect to an award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, and/or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain\\nspecified events. Our Board of Directors may require a participant to forfeit, return, or reimburse us all or a portion of the award and/or shares issued under the award, any amounts paid under the award, and any payments or proceeds paid or\\nprovided upon disposition of the shares issued under the award in order to comply with such clawback policy or applicable laws.Amendment; termination.The administrator has the authority to amend, suspend, or terminate our 2018 Plan provided such action\\ndoes not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2018 Plan automatically will terminate in 2028, unless we terminate it sooner.2018 Class C Stock Incentive PlanIn February 2018, our Board of Directors adopted, and we expect our stockholders will approve, our 2018 Class C Plan. Our 2018 Class C Plan\\nwill be effective on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of our registration statement related to this offering and is not expected to be used immediately. A total of 62,052,490 shares of our Class C common stock will be\\nreserved for issuance pursuant to our 2018 Class C Plan.

We expect our compensation committee to administer our ESPP. The administrator will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret, and apply the terms\\nof the ESPP, to delegate ministerial duties to any of our employees, to designate separate offerings under the ESPP, to designate our subsidiaries and affiliates as participating in the ESPP, to determine eligibility, to adjudicate all disputed\\nclaims filed under the ESPP and to establish procedures that it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the ESPP, including, but not limited to, adopting143Table of Contentssuch procedures,sub-plans,and appendices to the enrollment agreement as are necessary or appropriate to permit participation in the ESPP by employees who\\nare foreign nationals or employed outside the U.S. The administrator’s findings, decisions, and determinations are final and binding on all participants to the full extent permitted by law.Eligibility.Generally, all of our employees will be eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us, or any\\nparticipating subsidiary, for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. The administrator, in its discretion, may, prior to an enrollment date for all options granted on such enrollment date in an offering, determine\\nthat an employee who (i)\\xa0has not completed at least two years of service (or a lesser period of time determined by the administrator) since his or her last hire date, (ii)\\xa0customarily works not more than 20 hours per week (or a lesser\\nperiod of time determined by the administrator), (iii) customarily works not more than five months per calendar year (or a lesser period of time determined by the administrator), (iv) is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of\\nSection\\xa0414(q) of the Code, and (v)\\xa0is a highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section\\xa0414(q) of the Code with compensation above a certain level or is an officer or subject to disclosure requirements under\\nSection\\xa016(a) of the Exchange Act, is or is not eligible to participate in such offering period.However, an employee may not be\\ngranted rights to purchase shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock under our ESPP if such employee:•immediately after the grant would own capital stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock; or•hold rights to purchase shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock for each\\ncalendar year.Offering periods; purchase periods.Our ESPP includes a component that allows us to make\\nofferings intended to qualify under Section\\xa0423 of the Code and a component that allows us to make offerings not intended to qualify under Section\\xa0423 of the Code to designated companies, as described in our ESPP. No offerings have been\\nauthorized to date by our Board of Directors under the ESPP. If our Board of Directors authorizes an offering period under the ESPP, our Board of Directors is authorized to establish the duration of offering periods and purchase periods, including\\nthe starting and ending dates of offering periods and purchase periods, provided that no offering period may have a duration exceeding 27 months.Contributions.Our ESPP permits participants to purchase shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock through contributions (in the\\nform of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the administrator) of up to 15% of their eligible compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 2,500 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock during a purchase period.Exercise of purchase right.If our Board of Directors authorizes an offering and purchase period under the ESPP, amounts\\ncontributed and accumulated by the participant during any offering period will be used to purchase shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock at the end of each purchase period established by our Board of Directors. The purchase price of the shares\\nwill be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our Class\\xa0A common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the exercise date. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period and will be\\npaid their accrued contributions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.Non-transferability.A participant may not transfer rights granted under our ESPP.

Our 2017 Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options\\nto our employees, and for the grant of nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards, RSUs, and stock appreciation rights to employees, officers, directors, and certain of our consultants.Authorized shares.Our 2017 Plan will be terminated immediately prior to the effectiveness of our 2018 Plan, and accordingly, no\\nshares will be available for issuance under the 2017 Plan following its termination. Our 2017 Plan will continue to govern outstanding awards granted thereunder. As of December 31, 2017, 13,467,085 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock were\\nreserved for future issuance under our 2017 Plan and RSUs covering 25,061,536 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock remained outstanding under our 2017 Plan.Plan administration.Our Board of Directors or one or more committees appointed by our Board of Directors may administer our\\n2017 Plan. Our compensation committee currently administers our 2017 Plan. Subject to the provisions of our 2017 Plan, the administrator has the power to construe and interpret our 2017 Plan and any agreement thereunder and to determine the form and\\nterms of awards (including the participants), the number of shares subject to each award, the exercise price (if any), the fair market value of a share of our Class\\xa0A common stock, if such stock is not publicly-traded, listed, or admitted to\\ntrading on a national securities exchange, nor reported in any newspaper or other source, the vesting, exercisability, and payment of awards granted under our 2017 Plan, whether an award has been earned, and whether awards will be granted singly, in\\ncombination with, in tandem with, in replacement of, or as alternatives to, other awards. The administrator may correct, prescribe, amend, expand, modify, rescind, or terminate rules and regulations relating to our 2017 Plan. The administrator may,\\nat any time, authorize the issuance of new awards in exchange for the surrender and145Table of Contentscancellation of any or all outstanding awards with the consent of a participant. The administrator may also buy out an award previously granted for cash, shares, or other consideration as the\\nadministrator and the participant may agree.Options.Stock options may be granted under our 2017 Plan. The exercise price\\nper share of all options must equal at least the fair market value per share of our Class\\xa0A common stock on the date of grant, unless otherwise expressly determined in writing by the administrator on the grant date. The term of an option may\\nnot exceed ten years. An incentive stock option granted to a participant who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock on the date of grant, or any parent or subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in\\nexcess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the grant date. The methods of payment of the exercise price of an option include cash (by check) or shares or certain\\nother property or other consideration acceptable to the administrator and otherwise permitted under our 2017 Plan. After a participant’s termination of service for reasons other than for death, disability, or cause, the participant generally\\nmay exercise his or her options, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for three months after termination. After a participant’s termination of service for death or disability, the option generally will remain exercisable, to the\\nextent vested as of such date of termination, for 12 months after such termination. In no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term. After a participant’s termination of service for cause, the option generally will\\nexpire on the date of such termination.Restricted stock.Restricted stock awards may be granted under our 2017 Plan.\\nRestricted stock awards are offers by us to sell to an eligible person shares that are subject to certain specified restrictions, including restrictions on transferability and forfeiture provisions. Restricted stock awards will be entitled to\\nreceive all dividends or other distributions paid with respect to such shares, unless the administrator provides otherwise at the time of the award.RSUs.RSUs may be granted under our 2017 Plan. RSUs are awards covering a number of shares that may be settled in cash, or by\\nissue of those shares at a date in the future. No purchase price shall apply to an RSU settled in shares. The administrator may permit an RSU holder to defer payment under an RSU to a date or dates after the RSU is earned subject to certain\\nrestrictions set forth in our 2017 Plan. The administrator may permit holders of RSUs to receive dividend equivalent payments on outstanding RSUs if and when dividends are paid to stockholders in accordance with the terms of our 2017 Plan.Stock appreciation rights.Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2017 Plan. Stock appreciation rights\\nallow the participant to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of Class\\xa0A common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Subject to the provisions of our 2017 Plan, the administrator determines the terms of stock\\nappreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or shares. The per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right must\\nequal at least the fair market value per share of our Class\\xa0A common stock on the date of grant. The term of a stock appreciation right may not exceed 10 years from the date the stock appreciation right is signed. The administrator will\\ndetermine the period of time after a participant’s termination of service during which the participant may exercise his or her stock appreciation right, subject to the same terms and conditions as applicable to options as described above.Transferability or assignability of awards.Our 2017 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer or assignment of awards,\\nother than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, with respect to nonqualified options, by instrument to an inter vivos or testamentary trust in which the options are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor\\n(settlor)\\xa0or by gift to “family member,” and awards under our 2017 Plan may not be made subject to execution, attachment, or similar process. An award under our 2017 Plan generally is only exercisable by the participant or the\\nparticipant’s legal representative during the participant’s lifetime.Certain adjustments.In the event of certain\\nchanges in our capitalization, the administrator will proportionally adjust the number of shares that may be delivered under our 2017 Plan and/or the number and146Table of Contentsprice of shares covered by each outstanding award subject to any required action by our Board of Directors or stockholders.Dissolution or liquidation.In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, our Board of Directors may terminate any and all\\noutstanding awards followed by the payment of creditors and the distribution of any remaining funds to the our stockholders.Acquisition or other combination.If we are subject to an acquisition, consolidation, or merger, or similar conversion event,\\noutstanding awards under our 2017 Plan shall be subject to the agreement evidencing such transaction. The agreement may provide for the continuation, assumption, or substitution of outstanding awards by us (if we are the surviving corporation) or\\nthe successor or acquiring entity (if any), or the full or partial exercisability or vesting and accelerated expiration of awards, or the settlement of the full value of outstanding awards in cash, cash equivalents, or securities of the successor or\\nits parent followed by the cancellation of such awards. If an outstanding award is not continued, assumed, or substituted, the award will terminate and cease to be outstanding immediately following the occurrence of the applicable transaction.Amendment; termination.Our Board of Directors may terminate or amend our 2017 Plan at any time, provided that such amendment\\ndoes not impair the rights under outstanding options without the participant’s written consent. As noted above, prior to the adoption of our 2018 Plan in connection with this offering, our 2017 Plan will be terminated and no further awards will\\nbe granted thereunder. All outstanding awards will continue to be governed by their existing terms.2008 Equity Incentive Plan, As AmendedOur Board of Directors and stockholders adopted our 2008 Plan in January 2008. Our 2008 Plan was most recently amended in November\\n2016. Our 2008 Plan was terminated in connection with our adoption of our 2017 Plan. As of December 31, 2017, options to purchase 7,439,253 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock remained outstanding under our 2008 Plan at a weighted-average\\nexercise price of approximately $7.01 per share and RSUs covering 57,329,003 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock remained outstanding under our 2008 Plan. Awards granted under the 2008 Plan generally are subject to terms similar to those\\ndescribed above with respect to options and RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan. Our 2008 Plan provides that if there is (i)\\xa0a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, (ii)\\xa0any reorganization, consolidation, merger, or similar transaction\\nor series of related transactions resulting in a significant change in our voting securities as described in our 2008 Plan, or (iii)\\xa0a sale of all or substantially all of our assets followed by the distribution of the proceeds to our\\nstockholders, any or all outstanding awards may be assumed, converted, replaced, or substituted by the successor or acquiring corporation (if any). If a successor or acquiring corporation refuses to assume, convert, replace, or substitute awards,\\nvesting of awards will accelerate and options will become exercisable in full prior to the consummation of event on such terms as determined by the administrator, and all options that are not exercised prior to the consummation of the transaction\\nand all other awards will terminate. Our 2008 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer or assignment of awards, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution and, with respect to nonqualified options, by instrument to an inter\\nvivos or testamentary trust in which the options are to be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustor (settlor)\\xa0or by gift to “immediate family,” and awards may not be made subject to execution, attachment, or similar\\nprocess. An award is only exercisable by the participant or the participant’s legal representative during the participant’s lifetime. Our Board of Directors may amend our 2008 Plan at any time, provided that such amendment does not impair\\nthe rights under outstanding awards without the participant’s written consent.Cash Bonus PlanOur Board of Directors has adopted a cash bonus plan, or our Cash Bonus Plan, that allows us to financially incentivize and reward our\\nemployees, including our executive officers, based upon our performance and their individual contributions to our success.147Table of ContentsOur Cash Bonus Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee. Our Compensation\\nCommittee has the discretionary authority to interpret and administer our Cash Bonus Plan, including all terms defined therein, and to adopt rules and regulations to implement our Cash Bonus Plan, as it deems necessary. Our Compensation Committee\\nhas delegated to our Chief Financial Officer and our Vice President of People the day-to-day implementation and interpretation of our Cash Bonus Plan, including the approval of individual payouts under our Cash Bonus Plan to employees other than our\\nexecutive management team. However, approval of our Compensation Committee is required for any material amendments to our Cash Bonus Plan, approval of the aggregate payout under our Cash Bonus Plan, and approval of individual payouts under the Plan\\nto the executive management team.Unless otherwise determined by our Compensation Committee, all of our employees, including our named\\nexecutive officers, who (i) are employed by us before November 1 of the applicable calendar year and (ii) not covered by any other performance bonus, commission, or incentive plan, are eligible to participate in our Cash Bonus Plan. Participation in\\nour Cash Bonus Plan is effective on the later of January 1 or the applicable subsequent calendar year or the day (prior to November 1) that the eligible employee commences as a full-time/part-time regular employee of ours.Our Cash Bonus Plan features annual performance periods. For each performance period, our Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, will\\nestablish a bonus pool, which may be established before, during or after the applicable performance period. Our Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion and at any time, increase, reduce, or eliminate the amount allocated to the bonus\\npool. Actual awards will be paid from the bonus pool subject to the terms and conditions set forth in our Cash Bonus Plan.Our\\nCompensation Committee will, in its sole discretion, determine the performance goals applicable to any award. The goals may be based on any such factors our Compensation Committee determines relevant, and may be on an individual, divisional,\\nbusiness unit, or company-wide basis. Performance goals may be measured over the period of time determined by our Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. A performance period may be divided into one or more shorter periods if, for example,\\nbut not by way of limitation, our Compensation Committee desires to measure some performance criteria over 12 months and other criteria over fewer months. The performance goals may differ from eligible employee to eligible employee and from award to\\naward. Failure to meet the goals will result in a failure to earn the award, except as provided in our Cash Bonus Plan. As determined by our Compensation Committee, the performance goals may be based on GAAP or non-GAAP results and any actual\\nresults may be adjusted by our Compensation Committee for one-time items, unbudgeted or unexpected items, acquisition-related activities, or changes in applicable accounting rules when determining whether the performance goals have been met. Our\\nCompensation Committee retains the sole discretion to make or not make any such equitable adjustments.An eligible employee’s bonus\\ntarget is the percentage of his or her “eligible earnings” to be paid out at 100% performance achievement, determined by his or her position and communicated at the time of hire or as amended in writing. The bonus may be weighted based on\\nindividual performance to measurable objectives and company performance. The bonus can provide for payout above target for performance in excess of the individual performance factors and/or company performance factors. “Eligible earnings”\\nmeans base salary as of December 31 of the applicable performance period, prorated for hire date and leaves of absence (proration based on the number of days in the performance period, as permitted by applicable law) that occur in the performance\\nperiod. Eligible earnings exclude Company payments that are in addition to base salary, including, but not limited to, overtime, payments for moving or relocation allowances, or other wages (including but not limited to bonuses or commissions).Bonuses are earned on the date of payment and not sooner, either in whole or in part. Bonuses will be paid in cash as soon as practicable\\nafter we determine our financial results for the performance period, which generally occurs in the fiscal quarter immediately following the end of the performance period. Achieved bonuses, if any, will be paid before March 15 of such succeeding\\ncalendar year. Unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, an eligible employee must be employed by us through the date the bonus is paid.148Table of ContentsWe reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or terminate the Cash Bonus Plan in\\ntotal or in part, at any time. Any such change must be in writing and approved by the compensation committee. However, no modification or termination shall apply retroactively as to cause a forfeiture of an earned bonus.401(k) planWe\\nmaintain atax-qualified401(k) retirement plan for all U.S. employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. Under our 401(k) plan,\\nemployees may elect to defer up to all eligible compensation, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code limits. We match a portion of contributions made by our employees, including executives. We intend for our 401(k) plan to qualify under\\nSection\\xa0401(a)\\xa0and 501(a)\\xa0of the Code so that contributions by employees to our 401(k) plan, and income earned on those contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from our 401(k) plan.149Table of ContentsCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, AND OTHER\\nTRANSACTIONSIn addition to the compensation arrangements, including employment, termination of employment, and change in control\\narrangements, discussed in the sections titled “Management” and “Executive Compensation”, the following is a description of each transaction since January\\xa01, 2015, and each currently proposed transaction in which:•we have been or are to be a participant;•the amount involved exceeded or exceeds $120,000; and•any of our directors, executive officers, or holders of more than 5% of our outstanding capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals or entities, had\\nor will have a direct or indirect material interest.Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights AgreementWe are party to our Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, or IRA, dated as of January 30, 2014, which provides, among other\\nthings, that certain holders of our capital stock, including entities affiliated with each of Sequoia Capital, Accel, and T. Rowe Price, be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing. R.\\xa0Bryan Schreier, a member of our\\nBoard of Directors, is affiliated with Sequoia Capital.

Rowe Price, have agreed to vote their shares of our capital stock on certain matters, including with respect to the election of directors. R.\\nBryan Schreier, a member of our Board of Directors, is affiliated with Sequoia Capital. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, the Voting Agreement will terminate and none of our stockholders will have any special rights regarding the\\nelection or designation of members of our Board of Directors.Commercial ArrangementWe previously had a commercial relationship with Hewlett-Packard Company, of which Ms.\\xa0Whitman, a member of our Board of Directors, served\\nas the Chief Executive Officer from September 2011 to November 2015. During 2015, we made payments of $37.3\\xa0million for capital leases and commercial products and services provided by the Hewlett-Packard Company.We also have a commercial relationship with HPE, of which Ms. Whitman served as Chief Executive Officer from November 2015 to January 2018.These commercial relationships include infrastructure equipment under capital leases, the purchase of commercial products and other services, and a multi-year subscription agreement for access to the Dropbox platform. During 2016, we received\\npayments of $1.0\\xa0million for services rendered to HPE. During 2015, 2016, and 2017, we made payments of $10.9\\xa0million, $79.7\\xa0million, and $81.7\\xa0million, respectively, for capital leases and commercial products and services\\nprovided by HPE.150Table of ContentsEmployment ArrangementSheila Vashee, who is the wife of Ajay Vashee, our Chief Financial Officer, was employed by us in anon-executivecapacity. Her total compensation received in 2015, 2016, and 2017, which is comprised of a base salary and bonus, as applicable, was $234,228, $249,064, and $349,888, respectively, and was in\\nline with similar roles at the Company.\\xa0Additionally, we granted Ms.\\xa0Vashee equity awards covering 69,979 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock during this time.Dropbox Charitable FoundationDuring\\n2016, two of our controlling stockholders formed the Dropbox Charitable Foundation, a Delawarenon-stockcorporation, or the Foundation. The primary purpose of the Foundation is to engage in charitable and\\neducational activities within the meaning of Section\\xa0501(c)(3) of the Code. The Foundation is governed by a board of directors, a majority of which are independent. Both stockholders made contributions to the Foundation during 2016, comprised\\nentirely of shares of Dropbox common stock. As of December\\xa031, 2016, we had not made any contributions to the Foundation. We have not consolidated the Foundation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as we do not have control\\nof the entity.During the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred total expense of $11.3 million, which included $9.4\\xa0million of\\nexpense for anon-cashcharitable contribution, whereby we donated Class\\xa0B common shares to initially fund the Foundation, and cash contributions of $1.9 million to the Foundation.Executive and Director CompensationWe\\nhave granted stock options and RSUs to our executive officers and certain of our directors. See the sections titled “Executive Compensation—Outstanding Equity Awards at 2017Year-End”and“Management—Non-EmployeeDirector Compensation” for a description of these stock options and RSUs.Other than as described above under this section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” since\\nJanuary\\xa01, 2015, we have not entered into any transactions, nor are there any currently proposed transactions, between us and a related party where the amount involved exceeds, or would exceed, $120,000, and in which any related person had or\\nwill have a direct or indirect material interest. We believe the terms of the transactions described above were comparable to terms we could have obtained inarm’s-lengthdealings with unrelated third\\nparties.From time to time, we do business with other companies affiliated with certain holders of our capital stock. We believe that all\\nsuch arrangements have been entered into in the ordinary course of business and have been conducted on anarm’s-lengthbasis.Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Officers and DirectorsWe expect to adopt an amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of\\nthis offering, and which will contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for\\nmonetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for the following:•any breach of their duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;•any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;•unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section\\xa0174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or•any transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit.151Table of ContentsAny amendment to, or repeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of\\nthese provisions in respect of any act, omission, or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide for further limitations on the personal liability of directors of\\ncorporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.In addition, we expect to adopt amended and restated bylaws, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering,\\nand which will provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our\\ndirectors or officers or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws are expected to provide that we may indemnify to the\\nfullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or proceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our employees or agents or is or was serving at our request\\nas an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws will also provide that we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a director or officer in advance of\\nthe final disposition of any action or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions.Further, we have entered into or will enter into\\nindemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may be broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require us, among other\\nthings, to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive\\nofficers in investigating or defending any such action, suit, or proceeding. We believe that these agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers.The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions that are expected to be included in our amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and in indemnification agreements that we have entered into or will enter into with our directors and executive officers may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and\\nexecutive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders.\\nFurther, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, we are not\\naware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was one of our directors, officers, employees, or other agents or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation,\\npartnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.We have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of the policies, coverage is provided to our directors and\\nexecutive officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public securities matters, and to us with respect to payments that\\nmay be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law.Certain of ournon-employeedirectors may, through their relationships with their employers, be\\ninsured and/or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of our Board of Directors.The underwriting\\nagreement will provide for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling our\\ncompany pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in152Table of Contentsthe opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.Policies and Procedures for Related Party TransactionsFollowing the completion of this offering, our audit committee will have the primary responsibility for reviewing and approving or disapproving\\n“related party transactions,” which are transactions between us and related persons in which the aggregate amount involved exceeds or may be expected to exceed $120,000 and in which a related person has or will have a direct or indirect\\nmaterial interest. Upon completion of this offering, our policy regarding transactions between us and related persons will provide that a related person is defined as a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or greater than 5% beneficial\\nowner of our common stock, in each case since the beginning of the most recently completed year, and any of their immediate family members. Our audit committee charter that will be in effect upon completion of this offering will provide that our\\naudit committee shall review and approve or disapprove any related party transactions.153Table of ContentsPRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERSThe following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our capital stock as of January\\xa031, 2018,\\nand as adjusted to reflect the sale of our common stock offered by us and the selling stockholders in this offering assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from us and the selling\\nstockholders, for:•each of our named executive officers;•each of our directors;•all of our current directors and executive officers as a group;•each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of each of our Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock; and•all selling stockholders.We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the\\nrules of the SEC, and thus it represents sole or shared voting or investment power with respect to our securities. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment\\npower with respect to all shares that they beneficially owned, subject to community property laws where applicable.

We expect to adopt an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\\nbylaws that will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, and this description summarizes the provisions that are expected to be included in such documents. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the\\ninformation that may be important to you. For a complete description of the matters set forth in this section titled “Description of Capital Stock,” you should refer to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and\\nrestated bylaws and amended and restated investors’ rights agreement, which are included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and to the applicable provisions of Delaware law.Immediately following the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of capital stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of which:•shares are designated as Class\\xa0A common stock;•shares are designated as Class\\xa0B common stock;•shares are designated as Class\\xa0C common stock; and•shares are designated as preferred stock.Assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock, which will\\noccur immediately prior to the completion of this offering, as of December\\xa031, 2017, there were 17,727,212 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding (including the Capital Stock Conversions), held by 1,310 stockholders of record,\\n522,752,944 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding (including the Capital Stock Conversions and the RSU Settlement), held by 2,658 stockholders of record, and no shares of our Class C common stock outstanding. Pursuant to our amended and\\nrestated certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors will have the authority, without stockholder approval except as required by the listing standards of Nasdaq, to issue additional shares of our capital stock.Common StockWe have three classes of\\nauthorized common stock, Class\\xa0A common stock, Class\\xa0B common stock, and Class C common stock. The rights of the holders of Class\\xa0A common stock, Class\\xa0B common stock, and Class C common stock are identical, except with respect\\nto voting and conversion.Dividend RightsSubject to preferences that may apply to any shares of preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of our common stock are entitled to\\nreceive dividends out of funds legally available if our Board of Directors, in its discretion, determines to issue dividends and then only at the times and in the amounts that our Board of Directors may determine. See the section titled\\n“Dividend Policy” for additional information.Voting RightsHolders of our Class\\xa0A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders,\\nholders of our Class\\xa0B common stock are entitled to ten votes for each share held, and holders of our Class C common stock are not entitled to vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote of stockholders, except as otherwise required by law.\\nThe holders of our Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock vote together as a single class, unless otherwise required by law. Delaware law could require158Table of Contentseither holders of our Class\\xa0A common stock, our Class\\xa0B common stock, or our Class C common stock to vote separately as a single class in the following circumstances:•if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of a class of stock, or to increase or decrease the par value of a class of stock, then that\\nclass would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment; and•if we were to seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences, or special rights of a class of stock in a manner that affected its holders\\nadversely, then that class would be required to vote separately to approve the proposed amendment.Stockholders do not have\\nthe ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect at the closing of our initial public offering will provide for a classified\\nBoard of Directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms. Only the directors in one class will be subject to election by a plurality of the votes cast at each annual meeting of stockholders,\\nwith the directors in the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three year terms.No Preemptive or Similar RightsOur common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights, and is not subject to conversion, redemption, or sinking fund provisions.Right to Receive Liquidation DistributionsIf we become subject to a liquidation, dissolution, orwinding-up,the assets legally available for\\ndistribution to our stockholders would be distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock and any participating preferred stock outstanding at that time, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the\\npreferential rights of and the payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock.Conversion of Class\\xa0B\\nCommon StockEach share of Class\\xa0B common stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of\\nClass\\xa0A common stock. Following the completion of this offering, shares of Class\\xa0B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class\\xa0A common stock upon sale or transfer (other than with respect to certain estate planning\\ntransfers and transfers between our co-founders). In addition, each outstanding share of Class\\xa0B common stock held by a stockholder who is a natural person, or held by the permitted transferees of such stockholder, will convert automatically\\ninto one share of Class\\xa0A common stock upon the death or permanent and total disability of such stockholder, subject to a conversion delay for our co-founders of nine months or such later date not to exceed a total period of 18 months as may be\\napproved by a majority of our independent directors. Each share of Class\\xa0B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class\\xa0A common stock upon (i)\\xa0a date on or after the one year anniversary of the closing of our\\ninitial public offering that is specified by affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class\\xa0B common stock, (ii)\\xa0the date on which the outstanding shares of Class\\xa0B common stock represent less\\nthan five percent of the aggregate number of shares of the then outstanding Class\\xa0A common stock and Class\\xa0B common stock, or (iii)\\xa0nine months after the death or total disability of both of our co-founders, or such later date not to\\nexceed a total period of 18\\xa0months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.Additionally, pursuant to transfer agreements with certain of our stockholders, 3,914,934 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock will\\nautomatically convert into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock immediately prior to the completion of this offering.159Table of ContentsConversion of Class C Common StockShares of Class C common stock will convert automatically into Class A common stock, on a share-for-share basis, upon the conversion of all\\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock.Fully Paid andNon-AssessableIn connection with this offering, our legal counsel will opine that the shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock to be issued in this\\noffering will be fully paid andnon-assessable.Preferred StockOur Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to\\nestablish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations, or restrictions, in each case\\nwithout further vote or action by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of any series of preferred stock, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further\\nvote or action by our stockholders. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. The issuance\\nof preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company and might\\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock.RSAsAs of December 31, 2017, we had\\noutstanding 22,100,000 shares of our Class A common stock subject to RSAs, which were granted pursuant to the Co-Founder Grants. The Co-Founder Grants vest upon the satisfaction of the service condition and achievement of certain stock price goals.\\nWhile the Co-Founder Grants provide the holders with certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of our Class A common stock, the Co-Founder Grants will be excluded from Class A common stock issued and\\noutstanding until the satisfaction of the vesting conditions. See “Executive Compensation—Co-Founder Restricted Stock Awards” for additional information.OptionsAs of December 31, 2017, we had\\noutstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 7,439,253 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $7.01 per share, under our equity compensation plans.RSUsAs of December 31, 2017, we had\\noutstanding 57,329,003 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock subject to RSUs under our 2008 Plan and 25,061,536 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock subject to RSUs under our 2017 Plan. RSUs granted on and after August\\xa01, 2015, which we\\nrefer to asone-tierRSUs, generally vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition generally is satisfied over a four-year period. 25% of theone-tierRSUs vest upon completion of one year of service measured from the vesting commencement date, and as to the balance in successive equal quarterly installments, subject to continued service through each such\\nvesting date. Our RSUs granted prior to August\\xa01, 2015, which we refer to astwo-tierRSUs, generally vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and the160Table of ContentsPerformance Vesting Condition occurring before thesetwo-tierRSUs expire. The service-based vesting condition generally is satisfied over a four-year\\nperiod. 25% of thetwo-tierRSUs service-based vesting condition is satisfied upon completion of one year of service measured from the vesting commencement date, and the balance generally vests in successive\\nequal monthly installments prior to the occurrence of the Performance Vesting Condition and in successive equal quarterly installments after the occurrence of the Performance Vesting Condition, but, in all cases, subject to continued service through\\neach applicable vesting date. The Performance Vesting Condition occurs on the earlier of (i)\\xa0an acquisition or change in control of us or (ii)\\xa0the earlier of (a)\\xa0six months after our initial public offering or (b)\\xa0March\\xa015\\nof the year following our initial public offering. As a result of the September 2017 RSU Amendment, all RSUs were amended to provide that the quarterly dates for satisfying the service-based vesting condition shall be February\\xa015, May\\xa015,\\nAugust\\xa015, or November\\xa015, each of which we refer to as a New Quarterly Date. This amendment will result in a partial acceleration of any RSUs that were scheduled to satisfy the service-based vesting condition on a date following a New\\nQuarterly Date but before the next New Quarterly Date, such that these RSUs now will satisfy the service-based vesting condition on the first of those New Quarterly Dates. For one-tier RSUs, this amendment will be effective as of February 15, 2018,\\nand for two-tier RSUs, this amendment will be effective as of the satisfaction of the Performance Vesting Condition. In addition, as a result of the September 2017 RSU Amendment, any two-tier RSUs that are scheduled to satisfy the service-based\\nvesting condition on the first day of any month now will satisfy this condition on the 15th day of the prior month until the date that the Performance Vesting Condition is satisfied. Our Board of Directors has approved the acceleration of the\\nPerformance Vesting Condition associated with thetwo-tierRSUs to occur upon the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. All other significant terms of thetwo-tierRSUs will remain unchanged.Registration RightsAfter the completion of this offering, certain holders of our Class\\xa0B common stock will be entitled to rights with respect to the\\nregistration of their shares under the Securities Act. These registration rights are contained in our IRA. We and certain holders of our preferred stock are parties to the IRA. Immediately prior to the completion of this offering, each share of\\noutstanding preferred stock will convert automatically into one share of Class\\xa0B common stock. The registration rights set forth in the IRA will expire five years following the completion of this offering, or, with respect to any particular\\nstockholder, when such stockholder is able to sell all of its shares on any one day pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act or a similar exemption. We will pay the registration expenses (other than underwriting discounts, selling commissions, and\\ntransfer taxes) of the holders of the shares registered pursuant to the registrations described below. In an underwritten offering, the managing underwriter, if any, has the right, subject to specified conditions, to limit the number of shares such\\nholders may include. We expect that our stockholders will waive their rights under the IRA (i)\\xa0to notice of this offering and (ii)\\xa0to include their registrable shares in this offering. In addition, in connection with this offering, we\\nexpect that each stockholder that has registration rights will agree not to sell or otherwise dispose of any securities without the prior written consent of the company and the underwriters for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus,\\nsubject to certain terms and conditions and early release of certain holders in specified circumstances. See the section titled “Shares Eligible for Future Sale—Lock-Up and Market Standoff Agreements” for additional information\\nregarding such restrictions.Demand Registration RightsAfter the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 220,965,979 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock and 387,934 shares of our Class\\nA common stock will be entitled to certain demand registration rights. At any time beginning six months after the effective date of this offering, the holders of at least 40% of these shares then outstanding can request that we register the offer\\nand sale of their shares, or such request must cover securities in which the anticipated aggregate public offering price, before payment of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least $10,000,000. We are obligated to effect only two such\\nregistrations. If we determine that it would be seriously detrimental to us and our stockholders to effect such a demand registration, we have the right to defer such registration, not more than once in any12-monthperiod, for a period of up to 120 days.161Table of ContentsPiggyback Registration RightsAfter the completion of this offering, if we propose to register the offer and sale of our Class\\xa0A common stock under the Securities Act,\\nin connection with the public offering of such Class\\xa0A common stock, the holders of up to 220,965,979 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock and 387,934 shares of our Class A common stock will be entitled to certain “piggyback”\\nregistration rights allowing the holders to include their shares in such registration, subject to certain marketing and other limitations. As a result, whenever we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act, other than with\\nrespect to (1)\\xa0a registration in which the only Class\\xa0A common stock being registered is Class\\xa0A common stock issuable upon conversion of debt securities that are also being registered, (2)\\xa0a registration related to any employee\\nbenefit plan or a corporate reorganization or other transaction covered by Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act, or (3)\\xa0a registration on any registration form which does not permit secondary sales or does not include substantially the\\nsame information as would be required to be included in a registration statement covering the public offering of our Class\\xa0A common stock, the holders of these shares are entitled to notice of the registration and have the right, subject to\\ncertain limitations, to include their shares in the registration.S-3Registration RightsAfter the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 220,965,979 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock and 387,934 shares of our Class\\nA common stock will be entitled to certain FormS-3registration rights. The holders of at least 40% of these shares then outstanding may make a written request that we register the offer and sale of their\\nshares on a registration statement on FormS-3if we are eligible to file a registration statement on FormS-3so long as the request covers securities the anticipated\\naggregate public offering price of which, before payment of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least $3,000,000. These stockholders may make an unlimited number of requests for registration on FormS-3;however, we will not be required to effect a registration on FormS-3if we have effected two such registrations within the12-monthperiod preceding the date of the request. Additionally, if we determine that it would be seriously detrimental to the Company and our stockholders to effect such a registration, we have the right to\\ndefer such registration, not more than once in any12-monthperiod, for a period of up to 120 days.Anti-Takeover ProvisionsCertain\\nprovisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws, which are summarized below, may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or discouraging another person from acquiring control of\\nus. They are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our Board of Directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly\\nor unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us because negotiation of these proposals could result in an improvement of their terms.Delaware LawWe will be governed by the\\nprovisions of Section\\xa0203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section\\xa0203 prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period\\nof three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless:•the transaction was approved by the board of directors prior to the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder;•upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the\\ninterested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding shares owned by directors who are also officers of the corporation and shares owned by employee stock plans\\nin which employee participants162Table of Contentsdo not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or•at or subsequent to the time the stockholder became an interested stockholder, the business combination was approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders, and not\\nby written consent, by the affirmative vote of at leasttwo-thirdsof the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.In general, Section\\xa0203 defines a “business combination” to include mergers, asset sales, and other transactions resulting in\\nfinancial benefit to a stockholder and an “interested stockholder” as a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or, within three years, did own, 15% or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock. These\\nprovisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing changes in control of our company.Amended and Restated Certificate of\\nIncorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaw ProvisionsOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and\\nrestated bylaws will include a number of provisions that could deter hostile takeovers or delay or prevent changes in control of our Board of Directors or management team, including the following:Multi-class\\xa0stock. As described above in “—Common Stock—Voting Rights,” our amended and restated\\ncertificate of incorporation provides for a multi-class common stock structure, which will provide ourpre-offeringinvestors, which includes our executive officers, employees, directors, and their affiliates,\\nwith significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets.Board of Directors vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will\\nauthorize only our Board of Directors to fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats. In addition, the number of directors constituting our Board of Directors will be permitted to be set only by a resolution adopted by a majority vote\\nof our entire Board of Directors. These provisions would prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our Board of Directors and then gaining control of our Board of Directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. This will\\nmake it more difficult to change the composition of our Board of Directors and will promote continuity of management.Classified\\nBoard of Directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that our Board of Directors is classified into three classes of directors. A third party may be discouraged from making a\\ntender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and time consuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified Board of Directors. See the section titled\\n“Management—Classified Board of Directors.”Stockholder action; special meeting of stockholders. Our amended\\nand restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, but may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of our\\ncapital stock would not be able to amend our amended and restated bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws. Our amended and restated bylaws will further\\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of our Board of Directors, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, or our Chief Executive Officer, thus prohibiting a stockholder from calling a special meeting.\\nThese provisions might delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for stockholders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide\\nadvance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws will also\\nspecify certain requirements regarding the form and163Table of Contentscontent of a stockholder’s notice. These provisions might preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors\\nat our annual meeting of stockholders if the proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of\\ndirectors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.No cumulative voting. The Delaware General Corporation\\nLaw provides that stockholders are not entitled to cumulate votes in the election of directors unless a corporation’s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for\\ncumulative voting.Directors removed only for cause. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide\\nthat stockholders may remove directors only for cause.Amendment of charter and bylaws provisions. Any amendment of the\\nabove provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Bylaws would require approval by holders of at least 80% of the voting power of our then outstanding capital stock.Issuance of undesignated preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will have the authority, without further action by our\\nstockholders, to issue up to \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our Board of\\nDirectors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would enable our Board of Directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest, or\\nother means.Exclusive ForumOur\\namended and restated bylaws will provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and\\xa0exclusive forum\\xa0for (1)\\xa0any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2)\\xa0any action\\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (3)\\xa0any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any\\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (4)\\xa0any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the\\ncourt’s having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to this provision.\\nAlthough we believe these provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law for the specified types of actions and proceedings, the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our\\ndirectors and officers. Our amended and restated bylaws will also provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.Transfer Agent and RegistrarUpon\\ncompletion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be Computershare Trust Company, N.A. The transfer agent and registrar’s address is 144 Fernwood Avenue, Edison, NJ 08837.Limitations of Liability and IndemnificationSee the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of Officers\\nand Directors.”ListingWe\\nhave applied for the listing of our Class\\xa0A common stock on Nasdaq under the symbol “DBX”.164Table of ContentsSHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALEPrior to this offering, there has been no public market for our Class\\xa0A common stock, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that\\nmarket sales of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock for sale will have on the market price of our Class\\xa0A common stock prevailing from time to time. Future sales of our common\\nstock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale in the public market, could adversely affect market prices prevailing from time to time. As described below, only a limited number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock\\nwill be available for sale shortly after this offering due to contractual and legal restrictions on resale. Nevertheless, sales of our Class\\xa0A common stock in the public market after such restrictions lapse, or the perception that those sales\\nmay occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price at such time and our ability to raise equity capital in the future.Following the completion of this offering, based on the number of shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017, we will\\nhave a total of \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock outstanding, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0B common\\nstock outstanding, and no shares of Class C common stock outstanding. Of these outstanding shares, all \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock sold in this offering will be\\nfreely tradable, except that any shares purchased in this offering by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, would only be able to be sold in compliance with the Rule 144 limitations described below.The remaining outstanding shares of our common stock will be deemed “restricted securities” as defined in Rule 144 under the\\nSecurities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are\\nsummarized below. As a result of thelock-upand market standoff agreements described below and the provisions of our IRA described under the section titled “Description of Capital Stock—Registration\\nRights,” and subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock will be available for sale in the public market as follows:•beginning on the date of this prospectus, all \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale\\nin the public market; and•beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus (subject to the terms of the lock-up and market standoff agreements described below) \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nadditional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144,\\nas described below.Lock-Upand Market Standoff AgreementsOur executive officers, directors, and certain other holders of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our\\ncapital stock have agreed or will agree that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, or lock-up period, we and they will not, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and\\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock; provided that if (i) at least 120 days have elapsed since the date of this prospectus, (ii) we have\\npublicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (iii) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior to a broadly applicable period during which trading in\\nour securities would not be permitted under our insider trading policy, or a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\\nmay, in their discretion, release any of the securities subject to theselock-upagreements at any time. In addition, our executive officers, directors, and holders of our capital stock and securities\\nconvertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us under which they have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, they will not,\\nwithout our prior written consent, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock.165Table of ContentsIn addition, we will enter into alock-upagreement\\nwith the underwriters under which we will agree not to sell any of our stock for 180 days following the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions including, but not limited to, our issuance of shares of common stock or certain other\\nsecurities in connection with our acquisition of the securities, business, technology, property, or other assets of another person or entity or pursuant to an employee benefit plan that we assumed in connection with such acquisition, or our joint\\nventures, commercial relationships and other strategic transactions, provided that the aggregate number of shares of Class\\xa0A common stock (including with respect to securities to be granted pursuant to any assumed employee benefit plans covered\\nby a registration statement on FormS-8)issued pursuant to this exception will not exceed \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the total number of shares of Class\\xa0A common stock\\noutstanding immediately following this offering, and provided that each recipient executes and delivers alock-upagreement with substantially the same restrictions to which our executive officers, directors,\\nand certain other holders of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject.Rule 144In general, Rule 144 provides that once we have been subject to the public company reporting requirements of Section\\xa013 or\\nSection\\xa015(d) of the Exchange Act for at least 90 days, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during the 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares\\nof our Class\\xa0A common stock proposed to be sold for at least six months is entitled to sell those shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public\\ninformation requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then that person would be entitled to sell\\nthose shares without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144.In general, Rule 144 provides that our affiliates or persons\\nselling shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell upon expiration of the market standoff agreements andlock-upagreements described above, within any three-month\\nperiod, a number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock that does not exceed the greater of:•1% of the number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock then outstanding, which will equal \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 shares immediately after the completion of this\\noffering; or•the average weekly trading volume of our Class\\xa0A common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to that sale.Sales of Class\\xa0A common stock made in reliance upon Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock\\non behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.Rule 701Rule 701 generally allows a\\nstockholder who purchased shares of our capital stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon\\nRule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without\\ncomplying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling those shares pursuant to Rule 701.Registration RightsPursuant to our IRA,\\nafter the completion of this offering, the holders of up to 220,965,979 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock and 387,934 shares of our Class A common stock, or certain transferees, will be entitled166Table of Contentsto certain rights with respect to the registration of the offer and sale of those shares, as converted into an equivalent number of shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock upon such offer and\\nsale, under the Securities Act. See the section titled “Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights” for a description of these registration rights. If the offer and sale of these shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock are\\nregistered, the shares will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, subject to the Rule 144 limitations applicable to affiliates, and a large number of shares may be sold into the public market.Registration StatementWe intend to file\\na registration statement on FormS-8under the Securities Act promptly after the completion of this offering to register shares of our common stock subject to RSUs and options outstanding, as well as reserved\\nfor future issuance, under our equity compensation plans.

See the section titled “Executive Compensation—Employee Benefit and Stock Plans” for a description of our equity compensation plans.167Table of ContentsMATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TONON-U.S.HOLDERS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCKThe following is a summary of the material U.S.\\nfederal income tax consequences to certainnon-U.S.holders (as defined below) of the ownership and disposition of our Class\\xa0A common stock but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the\\npotential tax considerations relating thereto. This summary is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings, and judicial decisions, all\\nas of the date hereof. These authorities may be changed, possibly retroactively, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, has been, or will\\nbe, sought with respect to the tax consequences discussed herein, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a position contrary to the tax consequences discussed below or that any position taken by the IRS would not be sustained.This summary does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of anynon-U.S.,state, or\\nlocal jurisdiction, or under U.S. federal gift and estate tax laws, except to the limited extent set forth below. In addition, this discussion does not address the application of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or any tax\\nconsiderations applicable to anon-U.S.holder’s particular circumstances ornon-U.S.holders that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without\\nlimitation:•banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions (except to the extent specifically set forth below), regulated investment companies, or real estate investment trusts;•persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;•tax-exemptorganizations or governmental organizations;•controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies, or corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;•brokers or dealers in securities or currencies;•traders in securities or other persons that elect to use amark-to-marketmethod of accounting for their holdings in our stock;•U.S. expatriates or certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;•partnerships or entities classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities (and investors therein);•persons who hold our Class\\xa0A common stock as a position in a hedging transaction, “straddle,” “conversion transaction,” or other risk reduction transaction or integrated investment;•persons who hold or receive our Class\\xa0A common stock pursuant to the exercise of any employee stock option or otherwise as compensation;•persons who do not hold our Class\\xa0A common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section\\xa01221 of the Code;•persons deemed to sell our Class\\xa0A common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;•persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our Class\\xa0A common stock (except to the extent specifically set forth below); or•persons that own, or are deemed to own, our Class\\xa0B common stock.In addition, if a\\npartnership or entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our Class\\xa0A common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership.\\nAccordingly, partnerships that hold our Class\\xa0A common stock, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors.168Table of ContentsYou are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the U.S.\\nfederal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of our common stock arising under the U.S. federal estate or gift tax rules, under the laws of any state, local,non-U.S.,or other taxing jurisdiction, or under any applicable tax treaty.Non-U.S.Holder DefinedFor purposes of this discussion, you are anon-U.S.holder if you are a holder of our common stock that\\nis not a partnership (or entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and is not any of the following:•an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States (for U.S. federal income tax purposes);•a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof or other entity treated as such for U.S.\\nfederal income tax purposes;•an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or•a trust (x)\\xa0whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and which has one or more “U.S. persons” (within the meaning of Section\\xa07701(a)(3) of the Code) who have the\\nauthority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (y)\\xa0which has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person.DistributionsAs described in the\\nsection titled “Dividend Policy,” we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future. However, if we do make distributions on our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock, those payments will constitute dividends for U.S. tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. To the extent those\\ndistributions exceed both our current and our accumulated earnings and profits, they will constitute a return of capital and will first reduce your basis in our Class\\xa0A common stock, but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the\\nsale of stock as described below under “—Gain on Disposition of Our Class\\xa0A Common Stock.”Except as otherwise\\ndescribed below in the discussions of effectively connected income (in the next paragraph), backup withholding and FATCA, any dividend paid to you generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax either at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the\\ndividend or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. In order to receive a reduced treaty rate, you must provide us with an IRS FormW-8BEN,IRS FormW-8BEN-E,or other appropriate version of IRS FormW-8,including any required attachments and your taxpayer identification number,\\ncertifying qualification for the reduced rate; additionally you will be required to update such Forms and certifications from time to time as required by law. Anon-U.S.holder of shares of our Class\\xa0A\\ncommon stock eligible for a reduced rate of U.S. withholding tax pursuant to an income tax treaty may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. If thenon-U.S.holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on thenon-U.S.holder’s behalf, thenon-U.S.holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, which then will be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other\\nintermediaries.Non-U.S.holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.Dividends received by you that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable\\nincome tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States) are generally exempt from such withholding tax. In order to obtain this exemption, you must provide us with an IRS FormW-8ECIor other applicable IRS FormW-8,including any required attachments169Table of Contentsand your taxpayer identification number; additionally you will be required to update such forms and certifications from time to time as required by law. Such effectively connected dividends,\\nalthough not subject to withholding tax, are includable on your U.S. income tax return and generally taxed to you at the same graduated rates applicable to U.S. persons, net of certain deductions and credits. If you are a corporatenon-U.S.holder, dividends you receive that are effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified\\nby an applicable income tax treaty. You should consult your tax advisor regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.Gain on Disposition of Our Class\\xa0A Common StockExcept as otherwise described below in the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal\\nincome tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our Class\\xa0A common stock unless:•the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United\\nStates);•you are anon-residentalien individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or\\ndisposition occurs, and other conditions are met; or•our Class\\xa0A common stock constitutes a United States real property interest by reason of our status as a “United States real property holding corporation,” or USRPHC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes\\nat any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding your disposition of, or your holding period for, our Class\\xa0A common stock, and, in the case where shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock are regularly traded on an established\\nsecurities market, you own, or are treated as owning, more than 5% of our Class\\xa0A common stock at any time during the foregoing period.Generally, a corporation is a “United States real property holding corporation” if the fair market value of its United States real\\nproperty interests equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or held for use in a trade or business (all as determined for United States federal income tax purposes).\\nWe believe that we are not currently and will not become a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the remainder of this discussion assumes this is the case. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair\\nmarket value of our U.S. real property relative to the fair market value of our other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. Even if we become a USRPHC, however, as long as our Class\\xa0A common\\nstock is regularly traded on an established securities market, such Class\\xa0A common stock will be treated as U.S. real property interests only if you actually or constructively hold more than 5% of such regularly traded Class\\xa0A common stock\\nat any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding your disposition of, or your holding period for, our Class\\xa0A common stock. No assurance can be provided that our Class\\xa0A common stock will be regularly traded on an\\nestablished securities market at all times for purposes of the rules described above.If you are anon-U.S.holder described in the first bullet above, you will generally be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale under regular graduated U.S. federal income tax rates (and a corporatenon-U.S.holder described in the first bullet above also may be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate), unless otherwise provided by an applicable income tax treaty. If you are anon-U.S.holder described in the second bullet above, you will generally be required to pay a flat 30% tax (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on the gain derived from the sale, which\\ngain may be offset by U.S. source capital losses for the year (provided you have timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses). You should consult your tax advisor with respect to whether any applicable income tax or\\nother treaties may provide for different rules.170Table of ContentsFederal Estate TaxOur Class\\xa0A common stock beneficially owned by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States (as defined for U.S.\\nfederal estate tax purposes) at the time of their death will generally be includable in the decedent’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingGenerally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to you, your name and address, and the amount of tax withheld, if\\nany. A similar report will be sent to you. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in your country of residence.Payments of dividends or of proceeds on the disposition of stock made to you may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding at\\na current rate of 28% unless you establish an exemption, for example, by properly certifying yournon-U.S.status on an IRS FormW-8BEN,IRS FormW-8BEN-E,or another appropriate version of IRS FormW-8.Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting\\nmay apply if either we our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that you are a United States person as defined under the Code.Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the U.S. federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be\\nreduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may generally be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.FATCAThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance\\nAct and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or collectively, FATCA, generally impose withholding tax at a rate of 30% on dividends on and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our Class\\xa0A common stock paid to\\n“foreign financial institutions” (as specially defined under these rules), unless such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities\\nsubstantial information regarding the U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) or otherwise\\nestablishes an exemption. FATCA also generally imposes a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on dividends on and gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our Class\\xa0A common stock paid to a“non-financialforeign entities” (as specially defined under these rules) unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying certain substantial direct and indirect\\nU.S. owners of the entity, certifies that there are none, or otherwise establishes and certifies to an exemption. The withholding provisions under FATCA generally apply to dividends on our Class\\xa0A common stock, and under current transition\\nrules, are expected to apply with respect to the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our Class\\xa0A common stock on or after January\\xa01, 2019. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and your country of tax\\nresidence may modify the requirements described in this paragraph. If a dividend payment is both subject to withholding under FATCA and subject to the withholding tax discussed above under “—Distributions,” the withholding under FATCA\\nmay be credited against, and therefore reduce, such other withholding tax.Non-U.S.holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of FATCA on their investment in our\\nClass\\xa0A common stock.Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state,\\nand local, andnon-U.S.tax consequences of purchasing, holding, and disposing of our common stock, including the consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws.171Table of ContentsUNDERWRITING (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We, the selling stockholders and the underwriters named below will enter into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being\\noffered.

After the initial offering of the shares,172Table of Contentsthe representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the\\nunderwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.Our executive officers, directors, and certain other holders of our\\ncapital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have agreed or will agree that, subject to certain exceptions, for a period of 180 days after the date of this prospectus, or lock-up period, they will not, without\\nthe prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, dispose of or hedge any shares or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our capital stock; provided that if (i) at least 120 days have\\nelapsed since the date of this prospectus, (ii) we have publicly released our earnings results for the quarterly period during which this offering occurred, and (iii) such lock-up period is scheduled to end during or within five trading days prior\\nto a blackout period, such lock-up period will end ten trading days prior to the commencement of such blackout period. In addition, we will enter into a lock-up agreement with the underwriters under which we will agree not to sell any of our stock\\nfor 180 days following the date of this prospectus, subject to certain exceptions including, but not limited to, our issuance of shares of common stock or certain other securities in connection with our acquisition of the securities, business,\\ntechnology, property, or other assets of another person or entity or pursuant to an employee benefit plan that we assumed in connection with such acquisition, or our joint ventures, commercial relationships, and other strategic transactions,\\nprovided that the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock (including with respect to securities to be granted pursuant to any assumed employee benefit plans covered by a registration statement on Form S-8) issued pursuant to this\\nexception will not exceed \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0% of the total number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding immediately following this offering, and provided that each recipient executes and delivers a lock-up agreement with substantially\\nthe same restrictions to which our executive officers, directors, and certain holders of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock are subject. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\\nmay, in their discretion, release any of the securities subject to these lock-up agreements at any time. See “Shares Available for Future Sale” for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions, including market standoff agreements between\\nus and each of our executive officers, directors, and holders of our capital stock and securities convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock.Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among us, the\\nselling stockholders, and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our historical performance, estimates of our\\nbusiness potential and earnings prospects, an assessment of our management, and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses.We have applied to list our Class\\xa0A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “DBX”.In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of Class\\xa0A common stock in the open market. These\\ntransactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the\\noffering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A “covered short position” is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the\\nunderwriters’ option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of\\nshares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the\\noption described above. “Naked” short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked\\nshort position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the173Table of Contentsunderwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Class\\xa0A common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in\\nthe offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the\\nunderwriting discount received by it because the representatives have repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may\\nhave the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of\\nour Class\\xa0A common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be\\neffected on \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0, in theover-the-countermarket or otherwiseThe underwriters do not expect sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of shares of Class\\xa0A common\\nstock offered.We and the selling stockholders estimate that their share of the total expenses of the offering, excluding underwriting\\ndiscounts and commissions, will be approximately $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0.We and the\\nselling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933. In addition, we and the selling stockholders have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for\\ncertain expenses in connection with this offering in the amount up to $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0.The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include\\nsales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage, and other financial andnon-financialactivities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which\\nthey received or will receive customary fees and expenses. In 2014, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with affiliates of Goldman Sachs\\xa0& Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, under which these underwriters and their respective\\naffiliates have been, and may be in the future, paid customary fees. For additional information on our revolving credit facility, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”In September 2011, affiliates of Goldman Sachs\\xa0& Co. LLC, one of the\\nunderwriters, purchased an aggregate of 2,755,799 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, all of which shares will automatically convert into an aggregate of 2,755,799 shares of Class\\xa0B common stock in connection with this offering.In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, and\\nemployees may purchase, sell, or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps, and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their\\ncustomers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities, and/or instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise), and/or persons and entities with relationships\\nwith the issuer. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities,\\nor instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long, and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.174Table of ContentsAffiliates of Goldman Sachs\\xa0& Co.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of\\nthe three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated\\nfinancial position of the Company at December 31, 2016 and 2017, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial\\nreporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinion./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.San Francisco, CaliforniaFebruary 23, 2018F-2Table of ContentsDROPBOX, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except for par value)As\\xa0of\\xa0December\\xa031,Pro formastockholders’equityas ofDecember\\xa031,201620172017(unaudited)AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$352.7$430.0Trade and other receivables, net13.229.3Prepaid expenses and other current assets47.558.8Total current assets413.4518.1Property and equipment, net444.0341.9Intangible assets, net24.217.0Goodwill96.098.9Other assets26.644.0Total assets$1,004.2$1,019.9Liabilities and stockholders’ equityCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable$15.5$31.9Accrued and other current liabilities97.9129.8Accrued compensation and benefits41.356.1Capital lease obligation(1)127.6102.7Deferred revenue353.0417.9Total current liabilities635.3738.4Capital lease obligation,non-current(1)129.671.6Deferred rent,non-current72.569.8Othernon-currentliabilities44.037.2Total liabilities881.4917.0Commitments and contingencies (Note 10)Stockholders’ equity:Convertible preferred stock, $0.00001 par value; 226.8\\xa0shares authorized as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2016 and 2017; 221.4 shares issued and outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017; no shares authorized, issued and outstanding pro forma (unaudited); liquidation preference of $624.7 as of December\\xa031, 2016 and\\n2017615.3615.3$—Common stock $0.00001 par value; 1,500.0 shares authorized; Class\\xa0A commonstock\\xa0-\\xa0800.0shares authorized; 8.3\\xa0and 13.4 shares(2)issued and outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, respectively; 17.7 shares\\nissued and outstanding pro forma (unaudited); Class B commonstock\\xa0-\\xa0700.0shares authorized, 272.5 and 281.9 shares issued and outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, respectively; 522.8\\nshares issued and outstanding pro forma (unaudited)———Additionalpaid-incapital446.0533.11,564.0Accumulated deficit(937.5)(1,049.7)(1,465.3)Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)(1.0)4.24.2Total stockholders’ equity122.8102.9$102.9Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$1,004.2$1,019.9(1)Includes amounts attributable to related party transactions.

Description of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBusinessDropbox,\\nInc. (the “Company” or “Dropbox”) is a global collaboration platform. Dropbox was incorporated in May 2007 as Evenflow, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and changed its name to Dropbox, Inc. in October 2009. The Company is\\nheadquartered in San Francisco, California.Basis of presentation and consolidationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the United States of America generally accepted\\naccounting principles (“GAAP”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dropbox and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain\\nprior year non-current liability balances have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.On January\\xa01, 2017,\\nthe Company adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)No.\\xa02014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers(Topic 606) as discussed further inRecently\\nadopted accounting pronouncementsbelow (“Topic 606”). Topic 606 establishes a principle for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that reflects the expected consideration\\nreceived in exchange for those goods or services. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic340-40,Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs\\nof obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, references to Topic 606 used herein refer to both Topic 606 and Subtopic 340-40. The Company adopted Topic 606 with retrospective application to the beginning of the earliest period presented.Unaudited pro forma balance sheetSubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, immediately prior to the completion of the Company’s initial public offering, all of\\nthe 220,965,979 shares of convertible preferred stock will convert into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock. Further, pursuant to transfer agreements with certain of the Company’s stockholders, 387,934 shares of the\\nCompany’s convertible preferred stock and 3,914,934 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock will automatically convert into an equivalent numbers of shares of Class A common stock. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet information\\ngives effect to these conversions as of December\\xa031, 2017.As described in detail in “Stock-Based Compensation” below, the\\nCompany has granted restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that generally vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition, and with respect to RSUs granted prior to August 2015,(“two-tierRSUs”), upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition (the “Performance Vesting Condition”). The\\nPerformance Vesting Condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i)\\xa0an acquisition or change in control of the Company or (ii)\\xa0the earlier of (a)\\xa0six\\xa0months after our initial public offering or (b)\\xa0March\\xa015 of the year\\nfollowing our initial public offering. At the time the Performance Vesting Condition becomes probable, the Company will recognize the cumulative stock-based compensation expense for the two-tier RSUs that have met their service-based vesting\\ncondition using the accelerated attribution method. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma balance sheet information as of December\\xa031, 2017, gives effect to stock-based compensation expense of approximately $415.6\\xa0million associated withtwo-tierRSUs using the accelerated attribution method. This pro forma adjustment related to stock-based compensation expense of approximately $415.6\\xa0million has been reflected as an increase to additionalpaid-incapital and accumulated deficit.F-8Table of ContentsThe Company’s Board of Directors has approved the acceleration of the Performance\\nVesting Condition for two-tier RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of December 31, 2017, to occur upon the effectiveness of its registration statement related to this offering. Accordingly, to satisfy the tax withholding and\\nremittance obligations related to the two-tier RSUs, the Company will repurchase the number of shares necessary to satisfy the tax withholding obligations, based on the fair value of its common stock on the date of the initial public offering. The\\nCompany currently expects that the average of these withholding tax rates will be approximately 39%. Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0per share, which is the midpoint of\\nthe estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the Company estimates that its tax withholding and remittance obligation would be approximately $\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0million in the\\naggregate. Such amount is included as an increase in accrued and other current liabilities and an equivalent decrease in additional paid-in capital in the pro forma balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives\\neffect to the assumed conversion of the two-tier RSUs that had satisfied the service-based vesting condition and the Performance Vesting Condition as of December 31, 2017, and will convert into 23,844,147 shares of Class B common stock, net of\\n15,244,619 shares repurchased for tax withholding obligations.The shares of common stock issuable and the proceeds expected to be\\nreceived upon the completion of an initial public offering are excluded from the pro forma balance sheet.Use of estimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\\nthe amounts reported and disclosed in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. On a regular basis,\\nmanagement evaluates these estimates and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.The Company’s most\\nsignificant estimates and judgments involve recognition of revenue, the measurement of the Company’s stock-based compensation, including the estimation of the underlying deemed fair value of common stock, the estimation of the fair value of\\nmarket-based awards, and the valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill from business combinations.Financial information\\nabout segments and geographic areasThe Company manages its operations and allocates resources as a single operating segment.\\nFurther, the Company manages, monitors, and reports its financials as a single reporting segment. The Company’s chief operating decision-maker is its Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis\\nfor purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance, and allocating resources. For information regarding the Company’s long-lived assets and revenue by geographic area, see Note\\xa016.Foreign currency transactionsThe assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated from their respective functional currencies into U.S.\\ndollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenue and expense amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the period. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).Gains and losses realized from foreign currency transactions (those transactions denominated in currencies other than the foreign\\nsubsidiaries’ functional currency) are included in other income (expense), net. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured using foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the period, andnon-monetaryassets are remeasured based on historical exchange rates. The Company recorded $4.6\\xa0million and $3.6\\xa0million in net foreign currency transaction losses in the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and $5.0\\xa0million in net foreign currency gains in the year ended December\\xa031, 2017.F-9Table of ContentsRevenue recognitionThe Company adopted the requirements of Topic 606 as of January\\xa01, 2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. The impact\\nof adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s revenue is not material to any of the periods presented. The primary impact of adopting Topic 606 relates to the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and the amortization of those\\ncosts over a longer period of benefit.The Company derives its revenue from subscription fees from customers for access to its platform.\\nThe Company’s policy is to exclude sales and other indirect taxes when measuring the transaction price of its subscription agreements. The Company accounts for revenue contracts with customers by applying the requirements of Topic 606, which\\nincludes the following steps:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligationThe\\nCompany’s subscription agreements generally have monthly or annual contractual terms and a small percentage have multi-year contractual terms. Revenue is recognized ratably over the related contractual term beginning on the date that the\\nplatform is made available to a customer. Access to the platform represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to the end customer over the subscription term. The series of\\ndistinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. The Company recognizes revenue ratably because the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the platform throughout the contract period. The\\nCompany’s contracts are generallynon-cancelable.The Company bills in advance for monthly\\ncontracts and typically bills annually in advance for contracts with terms of one year or longer. The Company also recognizes an immaterial amount of contract assets, or unbilled receivables, primarily relating to rights to consideration for\\nservices completed but not billed at the reporting date. Unbilled receivables are classified as receivables when the Company has the right to invoice the customer.The Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance to deferred revenue. Deferred\\nrevenue primarily relates to the advance consideration received from the customer.The price of subscriptions is generally fixed at\\ncontract inception and therefore, the Company’s contracts do not contain a significant amount of variable consideration. As a result, the amount of revenue recognized in the periods presented from performance obligations satisfied (or partially\\nsatisfied) in previous periods was not material.The Company recognized $184.7\\xa0million, $266.9\\xa0million, and $353.0 million of\\nrevenue during 2015, 2016 and\\xa02017, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the respective periods.As of December 31, 2017, future estimated revenue related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end\\nof the reporting period was $467.8\\xa0million. The substantial majority of the unsatisfied performance obligations will be satisfied over the next twelve months.The Company applied the practical expedient in Topic 606 and did not evaluate contracts of one year or less for the existence of a significant\\nfinancing component. Multi-year contracts were not significant.F-10Table of ContentsStock-based compensationThe Company has granted RSUs to its employees and members of the Board of Directors under the 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (“2008\\nPlan”) and the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”). The Company had two types of RSUs outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2017:•One-tierRSUs, which have a service-based vesting condition over a four year period. These awards typically have a cliff vesting period of one year and continue to vest quarterly\\nthereafter. The Company began grantingone-tierRSUs under its 2008 Plan in August 2015 and it continues to grantone-tierRSUs under its 2017 Plan. The Company\\nrecognizes compensation expense associated withone-tierRSUs ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.•Two-tierRSUs, which have both a service-based vesting condition and the Performance Vesting Condition. The service-based vesting period for these awards is typically four years\\nwith a cliff vesting period of one year and continue to vest monthly thereafter. Upon satisfaction of the Performance Vesting Condition, these awards will vest quarterly. The Performance Vesting Condition is satisfied on the earlier of (i) an\\nacquisition or change in control of the Company or (ii) the earlier of (a) six months after the Company’s initial public offering or (b) March 15 of the year following the Company’s initial public offering. Prior to August 2015, the\\nCompany grantedtwo-tierRSUs under the 2008 Plan. The Company’s Board of Directors has approved the acceleration of the Performance Vesting Condition for two-tier RSUs, for which the service condition\\nwas satisfied as of December 31, 2017, to occur upon the effectiveness of its registration statement related to this offering. The last grant date fortwo-tierRSUs was in May 2015.As of December\\xa031, 2017, all compensation expense related totwo-tierRSUs remained unrecognized\\nbecause the Performance Vesting Condition was not satisfied. At the time the Performance Vesting Condition becomes probable, the Company will recognize the cumulative stock-based compensation expense for the two-tier RSUs that have met their\\nservice-based vesting condition using the accelerated attribution method. If the Performance Vesting Condition had occurred on December\\xa031, 2017, the Company would have recorded $415.6\\xa0million of stock-based compensation expense using the\\naccelerated attribution method. As of December\\xa031, 2017, 42.2\\xa0milliontwo-tierRSUs were outstanding, of which 39.1\\xa0million had met their service condition. If the Performance Vesting Condition\\nhad been satisfied on these two-tier RSUs as of December 31, 2017, unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million would be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately one year if the requisite service is provided. See\\nNote 11, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further discussion.Since August 2015, the Company has granted RSUs as the only\\nstock-based payment awards to its employees, excluding to its co-founders, and has not granted any stock options since then. The fair values of the common stock underlying the RSUs were determined by the Board of Directors, with input from\\nmanagement and contemporaneous third-party valuations, which were performed at least quarterly.In December 2017, the Board of Directors\\napproved a grant to the Company’s co-founders of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) with respect to 22.1 million shares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate (collectively, the “Co-Founder Grants”), of which\\xa015.5\\nmillion RSAs were granted to Mr. Houston, the Company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and 6.6 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Ferdowsi, the Company’s co-founder and Director. These Co-Founder Grants have service-based,\\nmarket-based, and performance-based vesting conditions.The Co-Founder Grants comprise nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on\\nthe achievement of stock price goals, or, each, a Stock Price Target. The Company estimated the grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation\\nthat incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the Stock Price Targets may not be satisfied. The average grant date fair value of each Co-Founder Grant was estimated to be $7.07 per share, and the Company will recognize aggregate\\nstock-based compensation expense of $156.2 million over the requisite service period ofF-11Table of Contentseach tranche, which ranged from 2.9 to 6.9 years, using the accelerated attribution method.\\xa0If the Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust\\nits stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. The Company will recognize expense if the requisite service is provided, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.The Co-Founder Grants contain an implied performance-based vesting condition satisfied upon the Company’s shares being traded on an\\nestablished national securities exchange or automated quotation system, because no shares subject to the Co-Founder Grants will vest until then. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, all compensation expense related to the Co-Founder Grants remained\\nunrecognized because the performance-based vesting condition was not deemed probable of being achieved. See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further discussion.The Company has outstanding stock options that will continue to vest through 2019 if the requisite service is provided. The Company used the\\nBlack-Scholes Merton Option (“BSM”) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted on the date of grant. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments\\nabout the variables used in the BSM model, including the fair value of its common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. These judgments are made as follows:•Fair value of common stock. The absence of an active market for the Company’s common stock requires it to estimate the fair value of its common stock for purposes of granting stock options, granting RSUs,\\nand for determining stock-based compensation expense for the periods presented. The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist in determining the fair value of its common stock. These contemporaneous third-party valuations\\nused the methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide,Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.The Company considered numerous factors in assessing the fair value of its common stock including:•The results of contemporaneous valuations of its common stock by unrelated third parties;•The rights, preferences, and privileges of its convertible preferred stock relative to those of its common stock;•Market multiples of comparable public companies in its industry as indicated by their market capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions;•The Company’s performance and market position relative to its competitors, who may change from time to time;•The Company’s historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for its future performance;•Valuations published by institutional investors that hold investments in the Company’s capital stock;•The economic and competitive environment;•The likelihood and timeline of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of Dropbox, given prevailing market conditions;•Any adjustments necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for its common stock; and•Precedent sales of or offers to purchase its capital stock.•Expected term. The Company determines the expected term based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding, generally calculated as the midpoint of the stock options’ vesting\\nterm and contractual expiration period, as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior.F-12Table of Contents•Expected volatility. The expected volatility rate is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with publicly traded equity securities with characteristics similar\\nto those of Dropbox.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security in effect at the time of grant for maturities corresponding with the expected term of the option.•Expected dividend yield. The Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero.The Company did not grant stock options during 2016 or 2017. The fair values of stock options granted to employees in 2015 were calculated\\nusing the following assumptions:Year\\xa0ended\\xa0December\\xa031,2015Expected volatility51% - 57%Risk-free interest rate1.4% - 1.9%Expected term (in years)6.0 - 6.1Expected dividend yield—Fair value of common stock$16.16\\xa0-\\xa0$16.82On January\\xa01, 2017, the Company adopted ASUNo.\\xa02016-09:Improvement to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting(Topic 718)issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which among other items, provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather\\nthan to account for them based on an estimate of expected forfeitures. The Company elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and therefore, stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, has been calculated based on\\nactual forfeitures in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, rather than the Company’s previous approach which was net of estimated forfeitures. The net cumulative effect of this change as of January\\xa01, 2017, was not\\nmaterial. Stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December\\xa031, 2015 and 2016, were recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which were based on historical forfeitures and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances, if\\nany.Cost of revenueCost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the storage, delivery, and distribution of the Company’s platform for both\\npaying users and Basic users. These costs, which are referred to as infrastructure costs, include depreciation of servers located inco-locationfacilities that the Company leases and operates, rent and\\nfacilities expense for those datacenters, network and bandwidth costs, support and maintenance costs for infrastructure equipment, and payments to third-party datacenter service providers. Cost of revenue also includes costs, such as salaries,\\nbonuses, benefits, travel-related expenses, and stock-based compensation, which are referred to as employee-related costs, for employees whose primary responsibilities relate to supporting the Company’s infrastructure and delivering user\\nsupport. Othernon-employeecosts included in cost of revenue include credit card fees related to processing customer transactions and allocated overhead, such as facilities, including rent, utilities,\\ndepreciation on leasehold improvements and other equipment shared by all departments, and shared information technology costs. In addition, cost of revenue includes amortization of developed technologies, professional fees related to user support\\ninitiatives, and property taxes related to the datacenters.Advertising and promotional expenseAdvertising and promotional expenses are included in sales and marketing expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and are\\nexpensed when incurred. Advertising and promotional expenses were $59.5\\xa0million, $46.6\\xa0million, and $80.1 million in the years ended December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.F-13Table of ContentsCash and cash equivalentsCash consists primarily of cash on deposit with banks. Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity\\ndate of 90 days or less from the date of purchase and primarily consist of money market funds. Cash equivalents also include amounts in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which typically settle within five days.\\nCash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.Trade and other receivables, netTrade and other receivables, net consists primarily of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts.Trade and other receivables, net consisted of the following as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017:December\\xa031,20162017Trade accounts receivables$13.1$29.7Other receivables0.10.6Less: Allowance for doubtful accounts—(1.0)Trade and other receivables, net$13.2$29.3The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of\\naccounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, the collection history of each customer, and other relevant factors to determine the appropriate amount\\nof the allowance. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.Concentrations of credit riskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash\\nequivalents, and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with well-established financial institutions. Cash equivalents consist primarily of highly rated money market funds.Trade accounts receivables are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers located around the world. Two customers\\naccounted for 11% and 12% of total trade and other receivables, net as of December\\xa031, 2016. Two customers accounted for 18% and 27% of total trade and other receivables, net as of December 31, 2017. No customer accounted for more than 10% of\\nthe Company’s revenue in the periods presented.Non-tradereceivablesThe Company recordsnon-tradereceivables to reflect amounts due for activities outside of its\\nsubscription agreements. Historically, the Company’snon-tradereceivables have related primarily to receivables resulting from tenant improvement allowances.Non-tradereceivables totaled $3.0\\xa0million and $5.2\\xa0million, as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and are classified within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the\\naccompanying consolidated balance sheets.Deferred commissions, netDeferred commissions, net is stated at gross deferred commissions less accumulated amortization. Sales commissions earned by the Company’s\\nsales force and third-party resellers, as well as related payroll taxes, areF-14Table of Contentsconsidered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. As a result, these amounts have been capitalized as deferred commissions within prepaid and other\\ncurrent assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company deferred incremental costs of obtaining a contract of $17.2\\xa0million and $19.4 million during the years ended December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Deferred commissions, net included in prepaid and other current assets were $3.7\\xa0million and $8.1\\xa0million as of December\\xa031,\\n2016 and 2017, respectively. Deferred commissions, net included in other assets were $16.4\\xa0million and $24.8 million as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Deferred commissions are amortized over a period of benefit of five years. The period of benefit was estimated by considering factors such as\\nhistorical customer attrition rates, the useful life of the Company’s technology, and the impact of competition in its industry. Amortized costs were $0.6\\xa0million, $3.7\\xa0million, and $6.6 million for the years ended December\\xa031,\\n2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Amortized costs are included in sales and marketing expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. There was no impairment loss in relation to the deferred costs for any period presented.Property and equipment, netEquipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\\nlife of the related asset, which is generally three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the initial term of the related lease.The following table presents the estimated useful lives of property and equipment:Property and equipmentUseful lifeBuildings20 to 30 yearsDatacenter and other computer equipment3 to 5 yearsOffice equipment and other3 to 7 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease termLease obligationsThe Company leases office space, datacenters, and equipment undernon-cancelablecapital and operating\\nleases with various expiration dates through 2033. Certain of the Company’s operating lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances from its landlords. These allowances are accounted for as lease incentive obligations, and are\\namortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term. In addition, certain of the operating lease agreements contain rent concession, rent escalation, and options to renew. Rent concession and rent escalation provisions are considered in\\ndetermining the straight-line rent expense to be recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins on the date the Company has the right to use the leased property for purposes of recognizing lease expense on a straight-line basis over the term of\\nthe lease. The Company does not assume renewals in its determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease inception.The Company leases certain equipment from various third parties, including from a related party, through equipment financing leases under\\ncapital leases. See Note 15, “Related Party Transactions” for additional details. These leases either include a bargain purchase option, a full transfer of ownership at the completion of the lease term, or the terms of the leases are at\\nleast 75\\xa0percent of the useful lives of the assets and are therefore classified as a capital leases. These leases are capitalized in property and equipment and the related amortization of assets under capital leases is included in depreciation\\nand amortization expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Initial asset values and lease obligations are based on the present value of future minimum lease payments.F-15Table of ContentsInternal use softwareThe Company capitalizes certain costs related to developed or modified software solely for its internal use and cloud based applications used\\nto deliver its platform. The Company capitalizes costs during the application development stage once the preliminary project stage is complete, management authorizes and commits to funding the project, and it is probable that the project will be\\ncompleted and that the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Capitalized internal use software costs were not material to\\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements during the years ended December\\xa031, 2015, 2016, and 2017.Business\\ncombinationsThe Company uses best estimates and assumptions to assign a fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\\nand liabilities assumed in business combinations as of the acquisition date. These estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, adjustments to the\\nfair value of these tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed may be recorded, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired\\nor liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.Long-lived assets, including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets, netThe Company evaluates the recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events\\nor circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\\nRecoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If such review determines that the carrying amount of specific property and equipment or\\nintangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to its fair value.The Company reviews goodwill for\\nimpairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of its single reporting unit below its carrying value.The Company has not recorded impairment charges on property and equipment, goodwill, or intangible assets for the periods presented in these\\nconsolidated financial statements.Acquired property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful\\nlives. The Company evaluates the estimated remaining useful life of these assets when events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the Company reduces the estimated useful life assumption for any\\nasset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life on a prospective basis.Deferred offering costsDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, accounting, and consulting fees relating to the initial public offering,\\nare capitalized. The deferred offering costs will be offset against initial public offering proceeds upon the consummation of the offering. In the event the offering is terminated, the deferred offering costs will be expensed. As of December 31,\\n2017, the Company had capitalized approximately $4.1 million of deferred offering costs within other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.Income taxesDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the Company’s\\nassets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply when taxes areF-16Table of Contentsactually paid or recovered. In addition, deferred tax assets are recorded for net operating loss and credit carryforwards.A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on all\\navailable positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes, but is not limited to, recent cumulative earnings or losses, expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, and the carry-forward periods available for the utilization\\nof deferred tax assets.The Company uses atwo-stepapproach to recognizing and measuring\\nuncertain income tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is\\nto measure the tax benefit as the largest amount, which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. Significant\\njudgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions.Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for its uncertain\\ntax positions, it can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. The Company evaluates its uncertain tax positions on a regular basis and evaluations are based on a number of factors, including\\nchanges in facts and circumstances, changes in tax law, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of an audit, and effective settlement of audit issues.To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision\\nfor income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Fair value measurementThe Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities andnon-financialassets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the\\nmarket-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions, and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the\\nfollowing hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities,\\nquoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level3—Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions\\nthat market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adoptedIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASUNo.\\xa02016-16,Income Taxes: Intra-Entity\\nTransfers Other than Inventory (Topic 740), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. ASU2016-16is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\\xa015, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial\\nstatements.F-17Table of ContentsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,Leases (Topic 842). Most prominent\\namong the changes in the standard is the recognition of right of use assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of\\nenabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The Company will be required to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest\\ncomparative period presented using a modified retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption by public entities is permitted. The\\nCompany is in the initial stage of its assessment of the new standard and is currently evaluating the timing of adoption, the quantitative impact of adoption, and the related disclosure requirements. The Company anticipates the adoption of this\\nstandard will result in a substantial increase in its non-current assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The adoption of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated statement of operations.\\nWhile the Company is assessing all potential impacts of the adoption of the standard, it currently expects the most significant impact to be the capitalization of right-to-use assets and lease liabilities for its office space and datacenter\\noperating leases. The Company expects its accounting for capital leases related to infrastructure equipment to remain substantially unchanged under the new standard.Recently adopted accounting pronouncementsIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.2014-09,Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\\n606)and Subtopic340-40,Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers (Subtopic340-40). Topic 606 supersedes the revenue recognition\\nrequirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 605,Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), and requires the recognition of revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the considerations\\nto which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Subtopic340-40requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively,\\nreference to Topic 606 used herein refers to both Topic 606 and Subtopic340-40.The Company\\nadopted the requirements of Topic 606 as of January\\xa01, 2017, utilizing the full retrospective method of transition. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in changes to accounting policies for revenue recognition, trade and other receivables, and\\ndeferred commissions.The impact of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s revenue is not material to any of the periods presented. The\\nprimary impact of adopting Topic 606 relates to the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining customer contracts and the amortization of those costs over a longer period of benefit. Under Topic 606, the Company defers all incremental costs to\\nobtain the contract, which primarily include sales commissions and related payroll taxes. The Company amortizes these costs over a period of benefit of five\\xa0years.In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09,Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting,which\\namends the guidance in ASC Topic 718. The standard provides clarity and reduces the cost and complexity when applying the guidance in ASC Topic 718 to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. ASU No. 2017-09 is effective\\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted.

Revolving Credit AgreementOn April\\xa03, 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit and guaranty agreement which currently provides for a\\n$600.0\\xa0million revolving loan facility (the “revolving credit facility”). The revolving credit facility has an accordion option, which, if exercised, would allow the Company to increase the aggregate commitments up to\\n$150.0\\xa0million, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments and satisfying certain conditions. The revolving credit facility replaced the Company’s existing $500.0\\xa0million revolving credit facility that was set to expire on\\nMarch\\xa020, 2018 (the “2014 revolving credit facility”). In conjunction with the revolving credit facility, the Company paid upfront issuance fees of $2.6\\xa0million, which are being amortized over the five-year term of the agreement.Pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility, the Company may issue letters of credit under the revolving credit facility,\\nwhich reduce the total amount available for borrowing.

In addition, the Company is required to pay a fee in connection with letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, which accrues at a rate of 1.5% per annum on the amount to be drawn\\nunder such letters of credit outstanding. There is an additional fronting fee of 0.125% per annum multiplied by the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under all letters of credit. Borrowings under the revolving credit\\nfacility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at an annual rate based on LIBOR plus a spread of 1.50% or at an alternative base rate plus a spread of 0.50%.F-22Table of ContentsThe revolving credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing, events of default\\nand covenants, including covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, make distributions to holders of the Company or its subsidiaries’ equity interests, make investments, or engage in transactions with\\nits affiliates. In addition, the revolving credit facility contains financial covenants, including a consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity balance of $100.0\\xa0million, which includes any available borrowing capacity. The\\nCompany was in compliance with the covenants of the 2014 revolving credit facility as of December\\xa031, 2016, and the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017.As of December\\xa031, 2016, the Company had an aggregate of $48.7\\xa0million of letters of credit outstanding under the 2014 revolving\\ncredit facility.

The obligation is included in capital lease commitments in the table below.In 2017, the Company entered into a new lease agreement for office space in San Francisco, California, to serve as its new corporate\\nheadquarters. The Company expects to start making recurring rental payments under the lease in the third quarter of 2019. Included in the operating lease commitments below are total expected minimum obligations under the lease agreement of $827.0\\nmillion, which exclude expected tenant improvement reimbursements from the landlord of approximately $73.6 million and variable operating expenses. The Company’s obligations under the lease are supported by a $34.2 million letter of credit,\\nwhich reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility.Future minimum payments under the Company’snon-cancelableleases, financing obligations, and other commitments as of December\\xa031, 2017, are as follows, and exclude non-cancelable rent payments from the Company’s sub-tenants:CapitalleasecommitmentsOperatingleasecommitments(1)OthercommitmentsYear ended December\\xa031:2018$108.3$91.5$64.0201954.994.949.9202018.4126.034.720210.4115.91.72022—109.0—Thereafter—812.64.8Future minimum payments182.0$1,349.9$155.1Less interest and taxes(7.7)Less current portion of the present value of minimum lease payments(102.7)Capital lease obligations, net of current portion$71.6(1)Consists of futurenon-cancelableminimum rental payments under operating leases for the Company’s offices and datacenters, excluding rent payments from the Company’s\\nsub-tenants and variable operating expenses. Non-cancelable rent payments from the Company’s sub-tenants as of December 31, 2017, are expected to be $72.1 million through 2023.Legal mattersFrom time to time, the Company is a party to a variety of claims, lawsuits, and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business,\\nincluding claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights. The Company records a liability when it believes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In its\\nopinion, resolution of pending matters is not likely to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, or its financial position. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, the Company bases its\\nestimate on the information available at the time of the assessment. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability and may revise the estimate.F-24Table of ContentsIndemnificationThe Company’s arrangements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if its products or services\\ninfringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims.Note 11.

TheF-27Table of Contentsweighted-average period over which such compensation expense will be recognized if the requisite service is provided is approximately 2.8 years as of December\\xa031, 2017.As of December\\xa031, 2017, all compensation expense related to the Company’stwo-tierRSUs\\nremained unrecognized because the Performance Vesting Condition was not satisfied. Approximately 39.1 milliontwo-tierRSUs had met their service-based vesting condition as of December\\xa031, 2017, but not\\nthe Performance Vesting Condition. If the Performance Vesting Condition had been satisfied on December\\xa031, 2017, the Company would have recorded $415.6\\xa0million of stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method\\nrelated to thetwo-tierRSUs. As of December\\xa031, 2017, approximately 3.1 milliontwo-tierRSUs had not met their service-based vesting condition. If the Performance\\nVesting Condition had been satisfied on thesetwo-tierRSUs as of December\\xa031, 2017, unamortized stock-based compensation expense of $5.6\\xa0million would be recognized over a weighted-average period of\\napproximately one year if the requisite service is provided.Co-Founder GrantsIn December 2017, the Board of Directors approved a grant to the Company’s co-founders of non-Plan RSAs with respect to 22.1 million\\nshares of Class A Common Stock in the aggregate (collectively, the “Co-Founder Grants”), of which\\xa015.5 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Houston, the Company’s co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and 6.6 million RSAs were\\ngranted to Mr. Ferdowsi, the Company’s co-founder and Director. These Co-Founder Grants have service-based, market-based, and performance-based vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grants are excluded from Class A common stock issued and\\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The Co-Founder Grants also provide the holders with certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common stock and a right to\\ncumulative declared dividends. However, the Co-Founder Grants are not considered a participating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders in Note 12 as the right to the cumulative declared dividends\\nis forfeitable if the service condition is not met.The Co-Founder Grants are eligible to vest over the ten-year period following the\\nclosing of this offering. The Co-Founder Grants comprise nine tranches that are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, or, each, a Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive thirty-day trading period during the\\nPerformance Period. The Performance Period begins on the first trading day following the later of (a) the expiration of the lock-up period following the first date the Company’s shares are traded on an established national securities exchange\\nor automated quotation system (the “IPO Date”) and (b) January 1, 2019 and ends on the earliest to occur of: (i) the date on which all shares subject to the Co-Founder Grants vest, (ii) the date the applicable co-founder ceases to satisfy\\nthe service-based vesting condition, (iii) the tenth anniversary of the IPO Date, and (iv) the occurrence of an acquisition of the Company prior to the IPO Date.During the first four years of the Performance Period, no more than 20% of the shares subject to each Co-Founder Grant would be eligible to\\nvest in any calendar year. After the first four years, all shares are eligible to vest based on the achievement of the Stock Price Targets.The Co-Founder Grants contain an implied performance-based vesting condition satisfied upon the IPO Date, because no shares subject to the\\nCo-Founder Grants will vest unless the IPO Date occurs. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2017, all compensation expense related to the Co-Founder Grants remained unrecognized because the performance-based vesting condition was not deemed probable of\\nbeing achieved.The Company calculated the grant date fair value of the Co-Founder Grants based on multiple stock price paths developed\\nthrough the use of a Monte Carlo simulation. A Monte Carlo simulation also calculates a derived service period for each of the nine vesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve each Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo\\nsimulation requires the use of various assumptions, including the underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to the length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected\\ndividend yield. The weighted-average grant date fair value ofF-28Table of Contentseach Co-Founder Grant was estimated to be $7.07 per share. The weighted-average derived service period of each Co-Founder Grant was estimated to be 5.2 years, and ranged from 2.9 - 6.9 years. The\\nCompany will recognize aggregate stock-based compensation expense of $156.2 million over the derived service period of each tranche using the accelerated attribution method as long as the co-founders satisfy their service-based vesting conditions.\\nIf the Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. The Company will recognize expense if the requisite\\nservice is provided, regardless of whether the market conditions are achieved.Award modificationsDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to approve the exchange of stock options previously\\ngranted to an executive officer under the Plan forone-tierRSUs. In total, options to purchase 6.5\\xa0million shares of common stock were exchanged for 3.3\\xa0million RSUs. Total compensation expense for\\nthe modified awards is $37.7\\xa0million, of which $18.8\\xa0million in stock-based compensation expense was recognized on the date of exchange representing the portion that vested immediately. Out of the total $37.7\\xa0million in stock-based\\ncompensation expense, $8.9\\xa0million was incremental to what would have been recognized related to the original stock option award. The Company will recognize approximately $2.4\\xa0million in stock-based compensation expense per quarter related\\nto these awards. As of December 31, 2017, the total unamortized expense relating to these awards was $2.4\\xa0million.Additionally,\\nduring the year ended December 31, 2016, the Board of Directors voted to approve a continuation of vesting upon change in employment status clause for an executive officer who had previously provided services to the Company. Under this clause,\\n0.6\\xa0million RSUs previously granted to the former executive officer will continue to vest for apre-determinedperiod of time. The continuation of vesting was accounted for as a modification of the terms\\nof the original award. As a result, the Company recognized an incremental $4.2\\xa0million of stock-based compensation expense. An additional $1.5\\xa0million of stock-based compensation expense may be recognized in future periods for the former\\nexecutive officers’two-tierRSUs if the initial qualifying liquidity event defined under the award agreement occurs.During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to approve a modification of vesting schedules for\\ncertain unvested one-tier and two-tier RSUs to align the vesting schedules for all RSUs to vest once per quarter. As a result of this modification, the Company’s unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to one-tier RSUs increased by\\n$3.2 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years if and when the awards vest. The total unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to two-tier RSUs decreased by $9.5 million. The unamortized amount will be\\nrecognized over a period of 0.9 years if and when the awards vest.F-29Table of ContentsNote 12.

Unaudited Pro Forma Net Loss Per SharePro forma net loss per share was computed to give effect to the automatic conversion of all series of convertible preferred stock using theif-convertedmethod as though the conversion had occurred as of the beginning of the period or the date of issuance, if later. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, immediately prior to the completion\\nof the Company’s initial public offering, 220,965,979 shares of convertible preferred stock will convert into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock. Further, pursuant to transfer agreements with certain of the Company’s\\nstockholders, 387,934 shares of the Company’s preferred stock and 3,914,934 shares of the Company’s Class B common stock will automatically convert into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock. In addition, the pro forma\\nshare amounts give effect to the weighted average issuance oftwo-tierRSUs that have satisfied the service-based vesting condition and the Performance Vesting Condition as of December\\xa031, 2017. The\\nCompany’s Board of Directors has approved the acceleration of the Performance Vesting Condition for two-tier RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of December 31, 2017, to occur upon the effectiveness of its registration\\nstatement related to this offering. The Company will repurchase the number of shares necessary to satisfy the tax withholding obligations, based on the fair value of its common stock on the date of the initial public offering. The Company currently\\nexpects that the average of these withholding tax rates will be approximately 39%. For two-tier RSUs for whichF-30Table of Contentsthe service-based vesting condition and the Performance Vesting Condition was satisfied as of December 31, 2017, the pro forma shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the\\nweighted-average issuance of 22,617,892 shares of Class B common stock, net of 14,460,620 million shares repurchased to satisfy tax withholding obligations.The net loss used in computing pro forma net loss per share amount in the table below does not give effect to thestock-basedcompensation expense associated withtwo-tierRSUs that have both aservice-basedvesting condition and the Performance\\nVesting Condition.

Accordingly, the Company established\\na full valuation allowance against its U.S. and Ireland deferred tax assets and a partial valuation allowance against its Israeli deferred tax assets.As of December\\xa031, 2017, the Company had $312.2\\xa0million of federal and $143.0\\xa0million of state net operating loss carryforwards\\navailable to reduce future taxable income, which will begin to expire in 2031 for federal and\\xa02030\\xa0for state tax purposes.As\\nof December\\xa031, 2017, the Company had research credit carryforwards of $59.2\\xa0million and $34.6\\xa0million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, of which $14.7\\xa0million and $8.6\\xa0million is the unrecognized tax\\nbenefit portion related to the research credit carryforwards for federal and state, respectively. The federal credit carryforward will begin to expire in 2027. The state research credits have no expiration date. The Company also had\\n$3.7\\xa0million of state enterprise zone credit carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2023.As of December\\xa031, 2017, the\\nCompany also had $289.3\\xa0million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income, which will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, the Company had $22.9\\xa0million of foreign acquired net operating\\nlosses, which will carryforward indefinitely.Under Section\\xa0382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the\\nCode, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use itspre-changenet operating loss carryforwards and otherpre-changeattributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by“5-percentshareholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. The Company performed a study for the period through\\nDecember\\xa031, 2017, and determined that no ownership changes exceeding 50 percentage points have occurred. The Company’s ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be\\nsubject to annual limitations as a result of ownership changes from January\\xa01, 2018, and subsequent years or as a result of this offering.F-33Table of ContentsAs of December\\xa031, 2017, the balance of unrecognized tax benefits was\\n$25.6\\xa0million of which $2.3\\xa0million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate and $23.3\\xa0million would result in adjustment to deferred tax assets with corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance.A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefit is as follows:Year\\xa0ended\\xa0December\\xa031,201520162017Balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of the fiscal year$3.1$7.9$15.7Gross increases related to prior period tax positions1.12.2—Gross increases related to current period tax positions3.75.69.9Balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits at the end of the fiscal year$7.9$15.7$25.6The Company recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax\\nexpense. As of December\\xa031, 2017, the amount of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions was $0.6 million. Interest and penalties recognized for the year ended December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017, was $0.4\\xa0million and\\n$0.2 million, respectively, and the Company did not recognize any interest and penalties for the year ended December\\xa031, 2015.The\\nCompany files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, multiple states, and foreign jurisdictions. All of the Company’s tax years from 2007 remain open for examination by the federal and state authorities, and from 2013 by foreign authorities.The Company generally does not provide deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as the Company\\nintends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely. Should circumstances change and it becomes apparent that some or all of the undistributed earnings will no longer be indefinitely reinvested, the Company will accrue for income taxes not previously\\nrecognized. As of December\\xa031, 2017, there were no cumulative undistributed earnings in its Irish subsidiary and, as a result, there were no unrecorded deferred tax liabilities. The amount of undistributed earnings in the Company’s other\\nforeign subsidiaries, if any, are immaterial.Impact of The Tax Cuts and Jobs ActThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and provides for significant changes to U.S. tax\\nlaw. Among other provisions, the Tax Reform Act reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 21%, effective in 2018. As a result, the Company has remeasured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the lower\\nrate expected to apply when these temporary differences reverse.The Company estimates that the remeasurement resulted in a reduction in\\ndeferred tax assets of $63.1\\xa0million, which was fully offset by a corresponding change to the Company’s valuation allowance. The impact will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which the Company\\nwill continue to monitor and assess.The Tax Reform Act also provides for a transition to a new territorial system of taxation and\\ngenerally requires companies to include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries into taxable income in 2017 (“Transition Tax”). As a result of the cumulative deficits in the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, the\\nCompany estimates that it will have no Transition Tax inclusion.The Tax Reform Act repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax\\n(“AMT”) effective beginning in 2018 and permits AMT credit carryforwards to be refunded to the extent unused through 2021. Since the Company does not anticipate the use of these credits to reduce future federal taxes, it recognized a\\nbenefit and established a receivable to reflect anticipated refunds of $1.4 million for its 2016 AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2017.F-34Table of ContentsThe Tax Reform Act contains a number of additional provisions which may impact the Company\\nin future years. However, since the Tax Reform Act was recently finalized and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation is expected over the next 12 months, the Company has not yet elected any changes to accounting policies and the\\nCompany’s analysis is ongoing. Provisional accounting impacts may change in future reporting periods until the accounting analysis is finalized, which will occur no later than one year from the date the Tax Reform Act was enacted.Note 15. Related Party TransactionsDropbox Charitable FoundationDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, two of the Company’s controlling shareholders formed the Dropbox Charitable Foundation, a\\nDelawarenon-stockcorporation (the “Foundation”). The primary purpose of the Foundation is to engage in charitable and educational activities within the meaning of Section\\xa0501(c)(3) of the\\nCode. The Foundation is governed by a Board of Directors, a majority of which are independent. Both shareholders made contributions to the Foundation during the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, comprised entirely of shares of Dropbox common stock.\\nThe Company has not consolidated the Foundation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, as the Company does not have control of the entity.During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $9.4\\xa0million of expense for anon-cashcharitable contribution, whereby the Company donated Class\\xa0B common shares to initially fund the Foundation. The expense was recorded to general and administrative expenses based on the\\nCompany’s estimate of the then current fair value of the contributed shares. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company made cash contributions of $1.9 million to the Foundation.Hewlett Packard EnterpriseThe Company has engaged in various commercial relationships with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (“HPE”), whose chief executive officer\\nwas appointed to the Dropbox Board of Directors in September 2017. These commercial relationships include infrastructure equipment under capital leases, the purchase of commercial products and other services, and a multi-year subscription agreement\\nfor access to the Dropbox platform. From the date of appointment of HPE’s chief executive officer to the Dropbox Board of Directors through December\\xa031, 2017, the Company made payments of $18.4\\xa0million for infrastructure equipment\\nunder capital leases and commercial products and services provided by HPE. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a remaining obligation of $87.1 million for equipment under capital lease from HPE. Related to the multi-year subscription agreement,\\nthe Company recognized an immaterial amount of revenue from the date of appointment of HPE’s chief executive officer to the Dropbox Board of Directors through December\\xa031, 2017, and had an immaterial balance of deferred revenue and\\noutstanding trade receivables as of December\\xa031, 2017.Note 16.\\xa0Geographic AreasLong-lived assetsThe following table sets forth long-lived assets by geographic area:As\\xa0of\\xa0December\\xa031,20162017United States$425.1$323.7International(1)18.918.2Total property and equipment, net$444.0$341.9(1)No single country other than the United States had a property and equipment balance greater than 10% of total property and equipment, net, as of December\\xa031, 2016 and 2017.F-35Table of ContentsRevenueRevenue by geography is generally based on the address of the customer as defined in the Company’s subscription agreement.

Subsequent EventsThe Company has evaluated subsequent events through February\\xa023, 2018, the date that the independent auditor’s report as of and for\\nthe year ended December 31, 2017 was originally issued and the audited annual consolidated financial statements were available for issuance.In February 2018, the Company amended its revolving credit facility to, among other things, permit the Company to make certain investments,\\nenter into an unsecured standby letter of credit facility, and increase its standby letter of credit sublimit to $187.5 million. The Company also increased its borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from $600.0 million to $725.0\\nmillion. The Company may from time to time request increases in its borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility of up to $275.0 million, provided no event of default has occurred or is continuing or would result from such increase.In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved grants of RSUs of 14,865,820. These RSUs will result in estimated stock-based compensation\\nof $170.2 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.9 years from the grant date.In February 2018,\\nthe Company’s Board of Directors also approved the acceleration of the Performance Vesting Condition for two-tier RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied, to occur upon the effectiveness of the registration statement related to this\\noffering.F-36Table of ContentsTable of ContentsPART IIINFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUSITEM\\xa013.

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.Section\\xa0145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a corporation’s board of directors to grant, and authorizes a court to\\naward, indemnity to officers, directors, and other corporate agents.We expect to adopt an amended and restated certificate of\\nincorporation, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering, and which will contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\\nConsequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for the following:•any breach of their duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;•any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;•unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section\\xa0174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or•any transaction from which they derived an improper personal benefit.Any amendment to, or\\nrepeal of, these provisions will not eliminate or reduce the effect of these provisions in respect of any act, omission, or claim that occurred or arose prior to that amendment or repeal. If the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended to provide\\nfor further limitations on the personal liability of directors of corporations, then the personal liability of our directors will be further limited to the greatest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law.In addition, we expect to adopt amended and restated bylaws, which will become effective immediately prior to the completion of this offering,\\nand which will provide that we will indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, orII-1Table of Contentsproceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our directors or officers or is or was serving at our request as a director or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint\\nventure, trust, or other enterprise. Our amended and restated bylaws are expected to provide that we may indemnify to the fullest extent permitted by law any person who is or was a party or is threatened to be made a party to any action, suit, or\\nproceeding by reason of the fact that he or she is or was one of our employees or agents or is or was serving at our request as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise. Our amended and\\nrestated bylaws will also provide that we must advance expenses incurred by or on behalf of a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, subject to limited exceptions.Further, we have entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers that may be\\nbroader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Law. These indemnification agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers against liabilities that may\\narise by reason of their status or service. These indemnification agreements also require us to advance all expenses incurred by the directors and executive officers in investigating or defending any such action, suit, or proceeding. We believe that\\nthese agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and executive officers.The limitation\\nof liability and indemnification provisions that are expected to be included in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and the indemnification agreements that we have entered into or will enter into with\\nour directors and executive officers may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and executive officers for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our\\ndirectors and executive officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards\\nagainst directors and executive officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, we are not aware of any pending litigation or proceeding involving any person who is or was one of our directors, officers, employees, or other\\nagents or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened\\nlitigation that may result in claims for indemnification.We have obtained insurance policies under which, subject to the limitations of\\nthe policies, coverage is provided to our directors and executive officers against loss arising from claims made by reason of breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful acts as a director or executive officer, including claims relating to public\\nsecurities matters, and to us with respect to payments that may be made by us to these directors and executive officers pursuant to our indemnification obligations or otherwise as a matter of law.Certain of ournon-employeedirectors may, through their relationships with their employers, be\\ninsured and/or indemnified against certain liabilities incurred in their capacity as members of our Board of Directors.The underwriting\\nagreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement will provide for indemnification by the underwriters of us and our officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act or otherwise.ITEM\\xa015. RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES.Since January\\xa01, 2014, we have issued the following unregistered securities:Preferred Stock IssuancesFrom January\\n2014 through April 2014, we sold an aggregate of 18,460,901 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock to 55 accredited investors at a purchase price of approximately $19.1012 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $352,625,362.II-2Table of ContentsOption and RSU IssuancesFrom January\\xa01, 2014 to December 31, 2017, we granted to our directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other service providers\\noptions to purchase an aggregate of 15,443,120 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock under our 2008 Plan at exercise prices ranging from approximately $13.84 to $16.82 per share.From January\\xa01, 2014 to December 31, 2017, we granted to our directors, officers, employees, consultants, and other service providers an\\naggregate of 28,780,524 RSUs to be settled in shares of our Class\\xa0A common stock under our 2017 Plan and an aggregate of 76,983,474 RSUs to be settled in shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock under our 2008 Plan.RSA GrantsIn December 2017, we granted\\nRSAs with respect to 22.1 million shares of Class A common stock, of which 15.5 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Houston, our co-founder and Chief Executive Officer, and 6.6 million RSAs were granted to Mr. Ferdowsi, our co-founder and Director.Shares Issued in Connection with Third-Party Tender OfferFrom January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017, we issued an aggregate of 8,193,202 shares of our Class A common stock in connection with a\\nthird-party tender offer to purchase shares of our capital stock from certain holders of our Class B common stock and convertible preferred stock. Each share of our Class B common stock and convertible preferred stock transferred in connection with\\nthe tender offer was automatically converted to one share of our Class A common stock.Shares Issued in Connection with AcquisitionsFrom January\\xa01, 2014 to December 31, 2017, we issued an aggregate of 6,265,795 shares of our Class\\xa0B common stock in connection with\\nour acquisitions of certain companies or their assets and as consideration to individuals and entities who were former service providers and/or stockholders of such companies.None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe the\\noffers, sales, and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act (or Regulation\\xa0D or Regulation\\xa0S promulgated thereunder) by virtue of Section\\xa04(2) of the Securities Act because the issuance\\nof securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering, or in reliance on Rule 701 because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as provided under such rule. The recipients of\\nthe securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the\\nstock certificates issued in these transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us. The sales of these securities were made without any general solicitation or advertising.ITEM\\xa016.

In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by\\na director, officer, or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit, or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the\\nregistrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the\\nAct and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that:(1)For purposes of determining any liability under the Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus\\nfiled by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4)\\xa0or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.(2)For the purpose of determining any liability under the Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein,\\nand the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.II-4Table of ContentsEXHIBIT INDEXExhibitNumberDescription1.1*Form of Underwriting Agreement.3.1Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, as amended and currently in effect.3.2Certificate of Amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as filed on April 4, 2014.3.3Certificate of Amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as filed on April 21, 2016.3.4*Form of Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Registrant, to be in effect upon completion of this offering.3.5Bylaws of the Registrant, as amended and currently in effect.3.6*Form of Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Registrant, to be in effect upon completion of this offering.4.1*Form of Class A common stock certificate of the Registrant.4.2Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement among the Registrant and certain holders of its capital stock, dated as of January\\xa030, 2014, as amended.5.1*Opinion of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich\\xa0& Rosati, P.C.10.1+Form of Indemnification Agreement between the Registrant and each of its directors and executive officers.10.2+Dropbox, Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and related form agreements.10.3+Dropbox, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and related form agreements.10.4+Dropbox, Inc. 2018 Class C Stock Incentive Plan and related form agreements.10.5+Dropbox, Inc. 2018 Class C Employee Stock Purchase Plan and related form agreements.10.6+Dropbox, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan and related form agreements.10.7+Dropbox, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and related form agreements.10.8+Dropbox, Inc.
