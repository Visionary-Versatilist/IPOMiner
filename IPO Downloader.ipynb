See Note 11, “Stockholders’ Equity” for further discussion.The Company has outstanding stock options that will continue to vest through 2019 if the requisite service is provided. The Company used the\n",
      "Black-Scholes Merton Option (“BSM”) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted on the date of grant. This valuation model for stock-based compensation expense requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments\n",
      "about the variables used in the BSM model, including the fair value of its common stock, expected term, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. These judgments are made as follows:•Fair value of common stock. The absence of an active market for the Company’s common stock requires it to estimate the fair value of its common stock for purposes of granting stock options, granting RSUs,\n",
      "and for determining stock-based compensation expense for the periods presented. The Company obtained contemporaneous third-party valuations to assist in determining the fair value of its common stock. These contemporaneous third-party valuations\n",
      "used the methodologies, approaches, and assumptions consistent with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide,Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.The Company considered numerous factors in assessing the fair value of its common stock including:•The results of contemporaneous valuations of its common stock by unrelated third parties;•The rights, preferences, and privileges of its convertible preferred stock relative to those of its common stock;•Market multiples of comparable public companies in its industry as indicated by their market capitalization and guideline merger and acquisition transactions;•The Company’s performance and market position relative to its competitors, who may change from time to time;•The Company’s historical financial results and estimated trends and prospects for its future performance;•Valuations published by institutional investors that hold investments in the Company’s capital stock;•The economic and competitive environment;•The likelihood and timeline of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of Dropbox, given prevailing market conditions;F-12Table of Contents•Any adjustments necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for its common stock; and•Precedent sales of or offers to purchase its capital stock.•Expected term.

      "term and contractual expiration period, as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior.•Expected volatility. The expected volatility rate is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with publicly traded equity securities with characteristics similar\n",
      "to those of Dropbox.•Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury security in effect at the time of grant for maturities corresponding with the expected term of the option.•Expected dividend yield. The Company has not paid and does not expect to pay dividends. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero.The Company did not grant stock options during 2016 or 2017.
