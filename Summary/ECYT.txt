have completed a phase 2 single-arm clinical trial in heavily pre-treated patients and observed a disease control rate, or DCR, of 57 percent at the eight week assessment in patients whose target tumors were all identified as over-expressing
the initiation of our PROCEED clinical trial.Technology Platform and Product PipelineOur technology platform has enabled us to develop multiple new SMDCs and companion imaging diagnostics for a range of disease
part of our phase 3 clinical trial for EC145, PROCEED, and intend to use the data from this trial to file an NDA with the FDA for the approval of EC20 for use in women with PROC.Other Pipeline ProgramsWe are developing a number of other SMDCs and companion imaging diagnostics which leverage our modular platform technology.
The critical elements of our business strategy are to:•obtain marketing approval of our lead SMDC, EC145, for treatment of women with PROC;•expand the use of EC145 to other cancers, including NSCLC;7•build a pipeline of SMDCs by leveraging our technology platform;•develop companion imaging diagnostics for each of our therapies; and•build commercial capabilities and partner to maximize the value of our SMDCs.Patents and Proprietary RightsWe own or have rights to 64 issued patents and 182 patent applications worldwide covering our core technology, SMDCs and companion imaging diagnostics.

Our current and planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:•limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials;•government or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines;•delay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of the product candidate for, or other drugs used in, our clinical trials as a result of our

could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from the sale of the product.We may not obtain government regulatory approval to market our product candidates or negotiate satisfactory pricing for our product
In addition, if the FDA requires us to undertake a second phase 3 clinical trial or obtain final OS data from PROCEED we will also require additional funding.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:•our need to expand our research and development activities;•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and the need to conduct clinical trials beyond those planned;•the outcome of the applications we intend to file with the EMA for conditional marketing authorization for EC145 and EC20;•the costs associated with establishing a sales force and commercialization capabilities;•the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;•the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining approval from the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities;•our ability to maintain, defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property portfolio;•our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;•the effect of competing technological and market developments;•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems appropriate for a public company; and•the economic and other terms and timing of collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter.Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future

regulatory agencies could also require additional clinical trials before or after granting of marketing approval for any products, which would result in increased costs and significant delays in the development and commercialization of such products
The forward-looking statements in this prospectus include, among other things, statements about:•our plans to seek conditional marketing authority for EC145 and EC20 in PROC from the EMA;•our ongoing phase 3 PROCEED trial;•our planned randomized phase 2 study of EC145 in NSCLC;•our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials and our approach to seeking FDA approval of our product candidates;•the potential benefits of, and our ability to enter into, collaboration arrangements;•the timing and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;•the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of our products;•our plans to leverage our linker system platform technology to discover and develop additional product candidates;•our ability to quickly and efficiently identify and develop product candidates;•our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy for EC145 and our other product candidates;•our intellectual property position;•our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; and•other risks and uncertainties, including those described under the heading “Risk Factors.”We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place
