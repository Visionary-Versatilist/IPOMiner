Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:•increase the cost of our products;•be expensive and time consuming to defend;•result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties;•force us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;•require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products;•require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property, the terms
recall could result in a diversion of management resources, substantial cost and negative publicity, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to commercialize products that incorporate Masimo SET or Rainbow technology is limited.In May 1998, we created a newly-formed entity, Masimo Laboratories, Inc., or Masimo Labs, and provided it rights to use Masimo SET to commercialize

We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations as a result of:•delays or interruptions in manufacturing and shipping of our products;•varying demand for and market acceptance of our technology and products;•the effect of competing technological and market developments resulting in lower selling prices or significant promotional costs;•changes in the timing of product orders and the volume of sales to our OEM partners;•actions taken by group purchasing organizations, or GPOs;•delays in hospital conversions to our products;•our legal expenses, particularly those related to litigation matters;•changes in our product or customer mix;•unanticipated delays or problems in the introduction of new products, including delays in obtaining clearance or approval from the FDA;•product recalls; and•high levels of returns and repairs.These factors, some of which are not within our control, may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially.

acquisitions, we may experience:•difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel and products into our existing business;•delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;•diversion of our management’s time and attention from other business concerns;•limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;•higher costs of integration than we anticipated; and•difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions.In addition, an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses
