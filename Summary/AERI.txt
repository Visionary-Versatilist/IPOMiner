Delays in regulatory approvals or rejections of applications for regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, Japan or other markets may result from many factors, including:•our inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;•regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;14Table of Contents•regulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our product candidates or other
personnel with requisite knowledge of our target market;•the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to adequate numbers of eye-care professionals to prescribe any future approved products;•unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and•a delay in bringing products to market after efforts to hire and train our sales force have already commenced.In the event we are unable to successfully market and promote our products, our business may be harmed.We currently intend to explore the licensing of commercialization rights or other forms of collaboration outside of the United States, which will

efforts may increase our expenses or divert our management’s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates;•changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition;•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and marketing internationally;•difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;•potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;•potential third-party patent rights in countries outside of the United States;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability, particularly in non-U.S. economies and markets, including several countries in

We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:•successfully complete clinical trials and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;•obtain and maintain patent protection and non-patent exclusivity for our products and otherwise prevent the introduction of generics of our products;•attract and retain key personnel;19Table of Contents•build an effective selling and marketing infrastructure;•demonstrate the advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative therapies;•compete against other products with fewer contraindications; and•obtain and sustain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our potential products or that reach the market sooner than our future products, if
