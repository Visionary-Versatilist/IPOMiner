million, assuming the shares are offered at $13.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus.We anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering will be used as follows:•approximately $24.0 million and $10.0 million for direct clinical and non-clinical costs, respectively, associated with the completion of

Delays in regulatory approvals or rejections of applications for regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, Japan or other markets may result from many factors, including:•our inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;•regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data, non-clinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials;14Table of Contents•regulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our product candidates or other
personnel with requisite knowledge of our target market;•the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to adequate numbers of eye-care professionals to prescribe any future approved products;•unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and•a delay in bringing products to market after efforts to hire and train our sales force have already commenced.In the event we are unable to successfully market and promote our products, our business may be harmed.We currently intend to explore the licensing of commercialization rights or other forms of collaboration outside of the United States, which will
business relationships subject us to additional risks that may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain profitable operations, including:•efforts to enter into collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties in connection with our international sales, marketing and distribution
efforts may increase our expenses or divert our management’s attention from the acquisition or development of product candidates;•changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition;•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals and marketing internationally;•difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;•potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;•potential third-party patent rights in countries outside of the United States;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability, particularly in non-U.S. economies and markets, including several countries in
labeling changes;•regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;•regulatory authorities may seize the product;•we may be required to change the way that the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or recall the product;•we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims fines, injunctions, or criminal penalties; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs
We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:•successfully complete clinical trials and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a timely and cost-effective manner;•obtain and maintain patent protection and non-patent exclusivity for our products and otherwise prevent the introduction of generics of our products;•attract and retain key personnel;19Table of Contents•build an effective selling and marketing infrastructure;•demonstrate the advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative therapies;•compete against other products with fewer contraindications; and•obtain and sustain adequate reimbursement from third-party payors.If our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our potential products or that reach the market sooner than our future products, if

To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies.If the prices for our potential products decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide adequate coverage and
facilities, imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;•impose other administrative or judicial civil or criminal penalties or pursue criminal prosecution;•withdraw regulatory approval;•refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or by our potential future collaborators;•impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or•seize or detain products.24Table of ContentsWe may not be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our potential product

following factors, in addition to other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:•announcements of regulatory approval or a complete response letter, or specific label indications or patient populations for its use, or changes or
delays in the regulatory review process;•announcements of therapeutic innovations or new products by us or our competitors;•adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials, manufacturing supply chain or sales and marketing activities;•any adverse changes to our relationship with manufacturers or suppliers;•the results of our testing and clinical trials;•the results of our efforts to acquire or license additional product candidates;•variations in the level of expenses related to our existing product candidates or preclinical and clinical development programs;•any intellectual property infringement actions in which we may become involved;•announcements concerning our competitors or the pharmaceutical industry in general;•achievement of expected product sales and profitability;41Table of Contents•manufacture, supply or distribution shortages;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;•trading volume of our common stock;•sales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;•general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets;•changes in accounting principles; and•the loss of any of our key scientific or management personnel.In addition, the stock market, in general, and small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to
equity-linked securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and warrants and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in further dilution to investors.As a result of this dilution, investors purchasing stock in this offering may receive significantly less than the purchase price paid in this offering in
obligations as a public company, which could subject us to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.We will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.
