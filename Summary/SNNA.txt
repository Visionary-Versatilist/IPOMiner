any such approval or clearance would delay commercialization of our product candidates and adversely impact our potential to generate revenue, our business and our results of operations.To gain approval to market our product candidates, we must provide the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that
bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including:•our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that any of our product candidates is safe and effective for the requested indication;•the FDA’s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency’s disagreement with our trial protocol or the interpretation of data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials;•our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of any of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;•the FDA’s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency’s requirement for additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials;•the FDA’s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency’snon-approvalof the formulation, labeling or specifications ofSNA-120orSNA-125;•the FDA’s or the applicable foreign regulatory agency’s failure to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers upon which we rely; or•the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory agencies to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.Of the large number of biopharmaceutical and medical device products in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or
