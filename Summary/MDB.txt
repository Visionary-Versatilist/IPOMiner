include, but are not limited to, the following:•We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.•We have a history of losses, and as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability.•Because we derive substantially all of our revenue from our database platform, failure of this platform to satisfy customer demands, could
adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.•We currently face significant competition.•If we do not effectively expand our sales and marketing organization, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing
results of operations could be adversely affected.•If we fail to continue to grow and to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, increase our revenue,
improve our results of operations, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.•The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock
