depends heavily on our success in:•completing the clinical development of the NanoTab System, initially for the treatment of post-operative pain in the hospital setting;•obtaining regulatory approval for the NanoTab System, which will require additional funding;•launching and commercializing the NanoTab System, including building a hospital-directed sales force in the U.S. and collaborating with third parties

are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.We have experienced and may in the future experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates.
Our clinical trials for any of our product candidates could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:•inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;•delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;•delays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;15Table of Contents•imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;•delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;•delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;•delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;•delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the device components of our product candidates;•delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;•time required to add new clinical sites; or•delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.If our clinical trials, including our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials for the NanoTab System or Phase 2 clinical trial for ARX-04, are delayed for any of the above
Any significant delay in the review or approval of an NDA that we submit would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Regulatory authorities may not approve our product candidates even if they meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials.The FDA and other foreign regulatory agencies, such as the EMA, can delay, limit or deny marketing approval for many reasons, including:•a product candidate may not be considered safe or effective;•the manufacturing processes or facilities we have selected may not meet the applicable requirements; and•changes in their approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part.Part of the regulatory approval process includes compliance inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure adherence to applicable regulations and guidelines.
rely on third party manufacturers to produce our preclinical and clinical drug supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties to produce commercial supplies of any approved product candidates.Reliance on third party manufacturers entails many risks including:•the inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;•a delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;•manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;•costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;•a failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;•the inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;•termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;•the reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply
financial results and the commercial prospects for the NanoTab System and any future product candidates that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.Development of ARX-04 is dependent on funding from our government grant with the USAMRMC.In May 2011, we received a grant from the USAMRMC, effective June 1, 2011, in which the USAMRMC granted $5.6 million to us in order to support the development of ARX-04.
System and our other product candidates will depend upon the acceptance of these products by the medical community, including physicians, nurses, patients, and pharmacy and therapeutics committees.The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:•demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;•the relative convenience, ease of administration and acceptance by physicians, patients and health care payors;•the prevalence and severity of any AEs or SAEs;•overcoming the perception of sufentanil as a potentially unsafe drug due to its high potency;•limitations or warnings contained in the FDA-approved label for the NanoTab System;22Table of Contents•availability of alternative treatments;•existing capital investment by hospitals in IV PCA technology;•pricing and cost-effectiveness;•the effectiveness of our or any future collaborators’ sales and marketing strategies;•our ability to obtain hospital formulary approval;•our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement; and•the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third party coverage.If the NanoTab System is approved, but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, nurses, patients and pharmacy and therapeutics committees, or
