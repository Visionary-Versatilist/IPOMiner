Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.Some of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:•bankruptcy proceedings or other significant financial distress;•significant negative industry or economic trends;•knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or•our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as “held for sale.”We recorded impairment charges of $0.3 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million due to underperforming restaurants during the fiscal years ended
estimated our common stock’s fair value based on an analysis of a number of objective and subjective factors that they believed that market participants would consider in valuing it, including the following:•financial metrics, including, but not limited to, our results of operations;•the valuation of our common stock by an unrelated third-party valuation firm for all stock options awarded in fiscal 2014;•the hiring of key personnel;•the fact that the option grants involved illiquid securities in a private company;•the risks inherent in the development and expansion of our food and services; and•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions.Before this offering, we historically granted stock options with exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock underlying
