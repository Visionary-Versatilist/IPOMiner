Some of the more significant risks are:•Our history of losses and that we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.4Table of Contents•Our limited operating history that makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.•If we lose the lease of our 200mm facility in Chandler, Arizona, we will need to move our manufacturing capability to another facility.•We may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand and match production levels to customer orders.•We rely on third parties to manufacture, package, assemble and test our products.•The market for our products is characterized by declines in average selling prices, which could negatively affect our revenue and margins.•We rely on our relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and original design manufacturers (ODMs) to enhance our product offerings and market position, and our failure to continue to develop or maintain

We also use standard CMOS wafers from third-party foundries, which we process at our Chandler, Arizona, facility.Relying on third-party manufacturing, assembly, packaging and testing presents a number of risks, including but not limited to:•capacity and materials shortages during periods of high demand;12Table of Contents•reduced control over delivery schedules, inventories and quality;•the unavailability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;•the inability to achieve required production or test capacity and acceptable yields on a timely basis;•misappropriation of our intellectual property;•the third party’s ability to perform its obligations due to bankruptcy or other financial constraints;•limited warranties on wafers or products supplied to us; and•potential increases in prices.We currently do not have long-term supply contracts with our
investments in our joint development;•we may experience difficulties in transferring technology to a foundry;•we may experience difficulties and delays in getting to and/or ramping production at foundries;•our control over the operations of foundries is limited;•due to financial constraints, our joint development collaborators may be unable to meet their commitments to us and may pose credit risks for our transactions with them;•due to differing business models or long-term business goals, our collaborators may decide not to join us in funding capital investment, which may result in higher levels of cash expenditures by us;•our cash flows may be inadequate to fund increased capital requirements;•we may experience difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our collaborators;•the terms of our arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable; and•changes in tax, legal, or regulatory requirements may necessitate changes in our agreements.Further, GLOBALFOUNDRIES may terminate the joint development agreement with us if we materially breach a term of the agreement, such as, but

Factors relating to our business that may16Table of Contentscontribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus:•the receipt, reduction, delay or cancellation of orders by large customers;•the gain or loss of significant customers or distributors;•the timing and success of our launch of new or enhanced products and those of our competitors;•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products;•the level of growth or decline in the industrial, automotive and transportation, enterprise storage and other markets;•the timing and extent of research and development and sales and marketing expenditures;•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;•changes in our product mix;•our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;•competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;•fluctuations in sales by and inventory levels of OEMs and ODMs that incorporate our memory products in their products;•cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our markets;•fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third-party manufacturers;•quality issues that arise from manufacturing issues at our third-party manufacturers;•events that impact the availability of production capacity at our third-party subcontractors and other interruptions in the supply chain including due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, materials shortages,
bankruptcy or other causes;•supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers’ products;•the timing of expenses related to the acquisition of technologies or businesses;•product rates of return or price concessions in excess of those expected or forecasted;•costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products;•unexpected inventory write-downs or write-offs;•costs associated with litigation over intellectual property rights and other litigation;•the length and unpredictability of the purchasing and budgeting cycles of our customers;•loss of key personnel or the inability to attract qualified engineers; and•geopolitical events, such as war, threat of war or terrorist actions, or the occurrence of natural disasters.The semiconductor memory industry is highly cyclical and our markets may experience significant cyclical fluctuations in demand as a result of
or technologies obsolete.Our ability to compete successfully depends on factors both within and outside of our control, including:•the functionality and performance of our products and those of our competitors;•our relationships with our customers and other industry participants;18Table of Contents•prices of our products and prices of our competitors’ products;•our ability to develop innovative products;•our competitors’ greater resources to make acquisitions;•our ability to obtain adequate capital to finance operations;•our ability to retain high-level talent, including our management team and engineers; and•the actions of our competitors, including merger and acquisition activity, launches of new products and other actions that could change the competitive landscape.Competition could result in pricing pressure, reduced revenue and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our
required to:•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology;•pay substantial damages for infringement;•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing products, processes or technology, which may not be successful;•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;•cross-license our technology to a competitor to resolve an infringement claim, which could weaken our ability to compete with that competitor; or•pay substantial damages to our customers to discontinue their use of or to replace infringing technology sold to them with non-infringing technology, if available.Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are:•difficulties, inefficiencies and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;24Table of Contents•longer and more difficult customer qualification and credit checks;•greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;•the need for various local approvals to operate in some countries;•difficulties in entering some foreign markets without larger-scale local operations;•compliance with local laws and regulations;•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including the elimination of tax holidays;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•adverse tax consequences as a result of repatriating cash generated from foreign operations to the United States;•adverse tax consequences, including potential additional tax exposure if we are deemed to have established a permanent establishment outside of the United States;•the effectiveness of our policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar regulations;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could increase the prices of our products to customers outside of the United States, increase the expenses of our international operations by reducing the purchasing power
