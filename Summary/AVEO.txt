tivozanib’s safety and efficacy through current and future clinical trials;•the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;•timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities;•achieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to tivozanib;•the availability, relative cost and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;•the effectiveness of our own or our potential strategic partners’ marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;•the ability of our third-party manufacturers to manufacture clinical trial supplies of tivozanib and to develop, validate and maintain a commercially
viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;•our ability to successfully launch commercial sales of tivozanib, assuming FDA approval is obtained, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•our ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims;•acceptance of tivozanib as safe and effective by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and•a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval.7Table of ContentsMany of these factors are beyond our control.
successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.Although a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the continued clinical testing and potential approval of tivozanib as well as
obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, which would require us to incur additional costs and delay receipt of any product revenue.We cannot predict whether we will encounter problems with any of our ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us or regulatory
We and our future strategic partners may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.11Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital RequirementsWe have incurred net operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses for the

limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.A substantial portion of our future revenues may be dependent upon our agreements with OSI Pharmaceuticals and Biogen Idec.Our success will depend in significant part on our ability to attract and maintain strategic partners and strategic relationships to
Some of the factors that may cause our operating losses to fluctuate on a period-to-period basis include:•the status of our preclinical and clinical development programs;•the level of expenses incurred in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs;•any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;•the implementation or termination of collaboration, licensing, manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties, and non-recurring revenue
For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:•execute product development activities;•obtain required regulatory approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;•build and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;•build and maintain robust sales, distribution and marketing capabilities;•gain market acceptance for our products;•develop and maintain successful strategic relationships; and•manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to clinical trials, regulatory approvals and commercialization.If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop product candidates, raise capital, expand our

Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:•decreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;•injury to our reputation;•withdrawal of clinical trial participants;•costs to defend the related litigation;•diversion of management’s time and our resources;•substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;•product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;•loss of revenue;•the inability to commercialize our product candidates; and•a decline in our stock price.17Table of ContentsOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable
distribution functions ourselves, we could face a number of additional risks, including:•we may not be able to attract and build an effective marketing or sales force;•the cost of establishing a marketing or sales force may not be justifiable in light of the revenues generated by any particular product; and•our direct sales and marketing efforts may not be successful.Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization
Market acceptance of any products for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy and safety of the product candidate, as demonstrated in clinical trials;18Table of Contents•the clinical indications for which the drug is approved;•acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;•with respect to tivozanib, the results obtained in our phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of advanced clear cell RCC and the extent to which the
Votrient;•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;•the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;•the continued projected growth of oncology drug markets;•relative convenience and ease of administration;•the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.If our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we would not be able to generate significant revenue.Reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.Market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend significantly on the availability of adequate coverage and
Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is:•a covered benefit under its health plan;•safe, effective and medically necessary;•appropriate for the specific patient;•cost-effective; and•neither experimental nor investigational.Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific,
products that we may develop or commercialize may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.Foreign governments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.We intend to seek approval to market our future products in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions.
proceedings may expose us or our strategic partners to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.Intellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common stock to
from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.•We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.•The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.Changes in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents.

The fair value of the common stock on that date took into account changes in the following factors:•initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial for AV-299, for which the first patient dosed triggered a $3.0 million milestone payment from Merck; and•because of the unfavorable conditions in the public markets, we deemed the probability of an IPO to be low, or 20%.The retrospective fair value of our common stock underlying options to purchase 114,437 shares granted on January 30, 2009 was
preferred stock which would be priced at a premium to our other series of convertible preferred stock;•the expected proceeds from the Biogen Idec agreement would improve our position for funding future cash needs;•due to our progress, including continued progress of our phase 2 clinical trial of tivozanib showing a favorable safety profile in patients with
advanced RCC, we deemed that the probability of an IPO increased to 25% and the probability of a sale below the liquidation preference decreased to 5%; and•the timeline for a sale above the liquidation preference was extended due to expected timing of enrollment of our phase 3 clinical trial of tivozanib.The retrospective fair value of our common stock underlying options to purchase 145,526 shares granted on
