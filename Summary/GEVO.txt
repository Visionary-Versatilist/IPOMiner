We intend to expand the global production of isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products beyond the Luverne Facility through a low-cost, high-margin licensing model, in collaboration with partners such as Praj Industries, with whom we have previously announced a joint development agreement.Competitive Strengths●Versatility of isobutanoltoaddresslargemarkets.Because isobutanol can be readily converted to hydrocarbon products such hydrocarbon fuels, including isooctane, isooctene, ATJ, lubricants, polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers, we believe that the addressable markets are very large; potentially ultimately reaching 40% of the global petrochemicals markets depending on the price of oil and the market value of renewable carbon.●Provencommercialtechnologiesandproducts.In addition to our ethanol production, our renewable isobutanol production technology has been proven to work at a commercial scale, (in an approximately 265,000-gallon fermenter) at our Luverne Facility.
A variety of factors may have a significant effect on our stock price, including:●actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;●the position of our cash and cash equivalents;●actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;●actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors’ operating results or changes in their growth rate;●announcements of technological innovations by us, our partners or our competitors;●announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;●the entry into, modification or termination of licensing arrangements, marketing arrangements, and/or research, development, commercialization, supply, off-take or distribution arrangements;●our ability to consistently produce commercial quantities of ethanol and isobutanol at the Luverne Facility and ramp up production to nameplate capacity;●additions or losses of customers or partners;●our ability to obtain certain regulatory approvals for the use of our ethanol and isobutanol in various fuels and chemicals markets;●commodity prices, including oil, ethanol and corn prices;●additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;●competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;●issuance of new or updated research reports by securities or industry analysts;●fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;●litigation involving us, our general industry or both;●disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;●announcements or expectations of additional financing efforts or the pursuit of strategic alternatives;●changes in existing laws, regulations and policies applicable to our business and products, including the Renewable Fuel Standard program, and the adoption of or failure to adopt carbon emissions regulation;●sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities, such as warrants, by us or our stockholders;●share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;●general market conditions in our industry; and●general economic and market conditions.Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies.
If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our development and commercialization efforts.The issuance of share-based payment awards under our stock incentive plan may cause dilution to our existing stockholders and may affect the market price of our common stock.We have used, and in the future we may continue to use, stock options, stock grants and other equity-based incentives, either pursuant to the 2010 Plan, or outside of the 2010 Plan, to provide motivation and compensation to our directors, officers, employees and key independent consultants.
If new debt is added to our or any of our subsidiaries’ debt levels, the risks described in “—Risks Related to this Offering and Owning Our Securities” could intensify.Our current and future indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our business, results of operations and financial condition, including:●increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;●limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;●requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes;●limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; and●placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.We cannot assure you that we will continue to maintain sufficient cash reserves or that our business will generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or that our cash needs will not increase.
We may also choose to seek additional capital sooner than required due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:●the timing of and costs of adding unit operations to achieve low-carbon ethanol;●the timing of, and costs involved in building out a full scale isobutanol and hydrocarbons plant;●the timing of, and costs involved in obtaining permits;●the ability for us to deploy strains of yeast with improved performance that help to lower capital cost;●the costs involved in acquiring and deploying additional equipment to attain final product specifications including at the Luverne Facility, that may be required by future customers;●the costs involved in increasing production capacity of our products, including at the Luverne Facility;●our ability to negotiate agreements supplying suitable biomass to our plants, and the timing and terms of those agreements;●the timing of, and the costs involved in developing adequate storage facilities for the products we produce;●our ability to gain market acceptance for isobutanol as a specialty chemical, gasoline blendstock and as a raw material for the production of hydrocarbons;●our ability to negotiate supply agreements for the products we produce, and the timing and terms of those agreements, including terms related to sales price;●our ability to negotiate sales of our products and the timing and terms of those sales, including terms related to sales price;●our ability to sell the iDGs left as a co-product of fermenting isobutanol from corn as animal feedstock;●our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the timing and terms of those arrangements; and●the cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent, trademark and other intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation.Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
If needed funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:●our research and development activities;●our plans to build out additional isobutanol and hydrocarbon capacity;●our plans to operate our ethanol plant●our production of products at the Luverne Facility;●our production of hydrocarbons at the demonstration plant located at the South Hampton facility near Houston, Texas, or any other future facilities;●our efforts to prepare, file, prosecute, maintain and enforce patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights and defend against claims by others that we may be violating their intellectual property rights; and/or●our activities in developing storage capacity and negotiating supply agreements that may be necessary for the commercialization of our products.16We may need to cease production at the Luverne Facility due to the condition of two of our fermentation vessels, unless repaired.As an older production facility, the Luverne Facility is more susceptible to maintenance issues that result in production challenges than newer production facilities.
Joint ventures are complex and time-consuming and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs related to such arrangements, including:●difficulties negotiating joint venture agreements with favorable terms and establishing relevant performance metrics;●difficulties completing the Retrofits of the accessed facilities using our integrated fermentation technology;●the inability to meet applicable performance targets related to the production of isobutanol;●difficulties obtaining the permits and approvals required to produce and sell our products in different geographic areas;●complexities associated with managing the geographic separation of accessed facilities;●diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to matters related to the joint ventures;●difficulties maintaining effective relationships with personnel from different corporate cultures; and●the inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset Retrofit costs.Additionally, our joint venture partners may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to entering into the joint ventures.
