our strategy include:•transform the treatment paradigm for rare genetically-defined diseases with the delivery of single-administration curative therapies;•advance our pipeline programs through clinical proof of concept and commercialization;•continue to expand our pipeline in existing and new therapeutic areas;•strengthen our platform by leveraging our internal discovery and development capabilities and selectively collaborating;•control manufacturing through ourin-housecapabilities; and•continue to strengthen and expand our intellectual property portfolio.Risk FactorsOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision.
been approved in the United States or in Europe, and there have only been a limited number of human clinical trials involving a gene editing product candidate, none of which utilize our novel gene correction technology;•our product candidates may cause serious adverse events, side effects, toxicities or have other properties which may delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label or
result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any;•adverse public perception of genetic medicine, and gene editing in particular, may negatively impact regulatory approval of or demand for our potential products;•the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete,
that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or that such quantities may not be available at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts;•our existing collaborations are important to our business and future licenses may also be important to us, and if we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these arrangements are not successful, our
Our expenses will also increase substantially if and as we:•continue our current research programs and our preclinical development of product candidates from our current research programs;•seek to identify, assess, acquire and/or develop additional research programs and additional product candidates;•initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop;•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•further develop our genetic medicines platform;•hire additional clinical, scientific and commercial personnel;12Table of Contents•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts, as well as to support our transition to a
operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.We expect to spend substantial amounts to complete the development of, seek regulatory approvals for and commercializeHMI-102.We will require additional capital beyond the proceeds of this offering, which we may raise through equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations,
Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:•the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of our planned clinical trials forHMI-102and our other product candidates;•the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;•the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;•the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us orHMI-102or any of our product
candidates;•the effect of competing technological and market developments;•the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;•the costs of operating as a public company;•the extent to which wein-licenseor acquire other products and technologies;•the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities forHMI-102in regions where we choose to commercialize our products; and•the initiation, progress, timing and results of our commercialization ofHMI-102,if approved for commercial sale.We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all.
candidates may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including those discussed in these risk factors and also:•we may not be able to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;•competitors may develop alternatives that render our potential product candidates obsolete or less attractive;•potential product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;•potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and
If we are unable to identify additional suitable product candidates for clinical development, this would adversely impact our business strategy and our financial position and share price and could potentially cause us to cease operations.We will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.As of March 1, 2018, we had 67 employees.
If these payments become due, we may not have sufficient funds available to meet our obligations or we may have to direct funds from other development efforts, and as a result, our development efforts may be materially harmed.Risks Related to Discovery, Development, Clinical Testing, Manufacturing and Regulatory ApprovalWe intend to identify and develop product candidates based on our novel genetic medicines platform, which makes it difficult to predict the time and
Clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical studies;•obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;•reaching an agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;19Table of Contents•obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;•recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;•developing and validating the companion diagnostic to be used in a clinical trial, if applicable;•having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatmentfollow-up;•clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;•addressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;•adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or•manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.We may
experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates or significantly increase the cost of such trials,
for patients who receive treatment using our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;•we may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;•additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product;•regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, such as a “black box” warning or contraindication;26Table of Contents•we may be required to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;•the product could become less competitive;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining
risks related to international pharmaceutical operations, including:•different regulatory requirements for drug and biologic approvals and rules governing drug and biologic commercialization in foreign countries;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights;•foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;•potential noncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions; and•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad.We have no prior experience in these areas.
