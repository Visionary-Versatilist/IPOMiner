that contribute to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter include:•the rate at which individuals adopt our solutions;•the timing and success of new technology introductions by us or our competitors;•our gain or loss of a key venue partner, roaming partner or platform services partner;•the number of air travel passengers, particularly business travelers;•intellectual property disputes; and•general economic conditions in our domestic and foreign markets.Due

future international operations may fail to succeed due to risks inherent in foreign operations, including:•different technological solutions for mobile Internet than those used in North America;•varied, unfamiliar and unclear legal and regulatory restrictions;•unexpected changes in international regulatory requirements and tariffs;•legal, political or systemic restrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries;•Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance and related risks;•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;•currency fluctuations; and•potential adverse tax consequences.As
business, operating results and financial condition.Our industry is competitive and if we do not compete successfully, we could lose market share, experience reduced revenue or suffer losses.The market for commercial mobile Wi-Fi solutions is competitive and impacted by technological change, and we expect competition with
software in order to continue offering the Boingo solution, or to discontinue operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares in this offering.Prior to this offering, there has not been a public market for our common stock, and an active market for our common stock may not
stock may fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, among others, many of which are beyond our control:•general market conditions;•domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;•changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;•changes in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry
changes necessitated by becoming a public company will require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight that will increase our costs.If we need additional capital in the future, it may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.We have historically relied on private placements of our equity securities and cash flow from operations to fund our operations,
