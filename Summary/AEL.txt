financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.Risks Relating to Our CompanyWe face competition from companies that have greater financial resources, broader arrays of products, higher ratings and stronger financial performance, which may impair our
products compete with those of other insurance companies, financial intermediaries and other institutions based on a number of factors, including premium rates, policy terms and conditions, service
adversely affect relationships with distributors, and increase policy surrenders and withdrawals.Financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of life insurance and annuity companies.
during 2003 may be affected by, among other things, the current ratings and our levels of statutory capital and surplus.General economic conditions, including changing interest rates and market volatility, affect both the risks and the returns on both our products and our investment portfolio.The market value of our investments and our investment performance, including yields and realization of gains or losses, may vary depending on
entered into a coinsurance agreement with Equitrust Life Insurance Company, or Equitrust, an affiliate of Farm Bureau, covering 70% of our non-multi year rate guarantee fixed annuities and index
application of SFAS No. 133 in future periods to the revenues and expenses related to our index annuity business may cause volatility in our reported net income.If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial performance could be adversely affected; our historical growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth.We have experienced rapid growth since our formation in December 1995.
If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient marketers and agents to sell our products, our ability to compete and our revenues would suffer.12We may require additional capital to support sustained future growth which may not be available when needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our long-term strategic capital requirements will depend on many factors including the accumulated statutory earnings of our life subsidiaries and the
relationship between the statutory capital and surplus of our life subsidiaries and (i) the rate of growth in sales of our products; and (ii) the levels of credit risk and/or interest
If we cannot maintain adequate capital, we may be required to limit growth in sales of new annuity products, and such action could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
non-qualified annuities.13Changes in federal income taxation laws, including recent reductions in individual income tax rates, may affect sales of our products and profitability.The annuity products that we market generally offer tax advantages to the policyholders, as compared to other savings instruments such as certificates
that pay dividends than they were prior to the 2003 Act. Therefore, these changes could have the result of reducing sales of our annuities.We face risks relating to litigation, including the costs of such litigation, management distraction and the potential for damage awards, which may adversely impact our
Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.Possible future sales of our common stock by our officers and others could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and make equity capital raising more
