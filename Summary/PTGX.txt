Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical studies for our peptide-based product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.Some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the

We believe competition will also include approved iron chelation therapies that have been developed by Novartis and Apotex, among others.We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:•the efficacy and safety of our product candidates, in particular compared to marketed products and products in late-stage development;•the time it takes for our product candidates to complete clinical development and receive regulatory approval, if at all;•the ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;•the price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;•whether coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement are available under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;•the ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates;•the ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval; and•acceptance of any of our approved product candidates by physicians, payors and other healthcare providers.Because our research approach depends on our proprietary technology platform, it may be difficult for us to continue to successfully compete in
The degree of market acceptance, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:•the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;•effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;•our ability to offer our peptide-based product candidates for sale at competitive prices;•the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the willingness of the medical community to offer customers our peptide-based product candidates in addition to or in the place of current injectable therapies;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the availability of government and third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and•any restrictions on the use of our product candidates together with other medications.Because
