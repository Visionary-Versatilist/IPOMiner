U.S. Treasuries, as further described below.Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by purchasing Coal Futures that are traded on the CME Facilities, including smaller sized “mini” contracts (if they are available) which represent a portion of the normal futures contracts, to the greatest extent possible, without being leveraged or exceeding relevant position limits.

See “Description of the Shares—Distributions” and “Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.”Reports to ShareholdersThe Sponsor will furnish an annual report of the Fund in the manner required by the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) as well as with those reports required by the CFTC and the NFA, including, but not limited to, an annual audited financial statement examined and certified by an independent registered public accounting firm, and any other reports required by any other governmental authority that has jurisdiction over the activities of the Fund.
Prospective investors should be aware that:●An investor could lose a substantial portion or all of its investment.●Commodity trading is highly speculative, and the Fund is likely to be volatile and could suffer from periods of prolonged decline in value.●The Fund has not commenced operations, so there is no performance history to serve as a basis for investors to evaluate an investment in the Fund.●The structure and operation of the Fund may involve conflicts of interest.●Investors will have no rights to participate in the management of the Fund and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of the Sponsor to manage the Fund.●Currently, although coal futures markets are only subject to position limits in the expiration month and position accountability limits in the other months, regulatory authorities may in the future apply position limits to all coal futures delivery months, which could limit the Fund’s investment objective.●Investors may choose to use the Fund as a means of indirectly investing in coal.
The markets and prices for coal are affected by many factors, including:●the location, availability, quality and price of competing fuels such as natural gas and oil, and alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric and nuclear power;●technological developments in the traditional and alternative energy industries;●global demand for electricity and steel;●energy, environmental, fiscal and other governmental programs and policies;●weather and other environmental conditions;●global or regional political, economic or financial events and conditions;●global coal inventories, production rates and production costs;●currency exchange rates; and●the general sentiment of market participants.The Sponsor anticipates that a decline in the price of coal will result in a decline in the NAV and the value of the Shares.The coal industry is extensively regulated, and costs of compliance with existing and future regulations could adversely impact the price of coal.Coal mining operations are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety, transportation, labor and other laws and regulations.
However, changes in the NAV may not replicate the performance of Coal Futures due to a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:●the Fund may not be able to purchase or sell the exact amount of Coal Futures required to meet its investment objective;●coal market disruptions may prevent the Fund from purchasing Coal Futures at a particular price, or at all;●regulatory or other extraordinary circumstances may limit the Fund’s ability to create or redeem Baskets;●the Fund will pay certain of its fees and expenses, including brokerage fees and expenses, extraordinary expenses, and the Sponsor Fee, and a significant increase in the Fund’s liabilities and expenses could lead to underperformance of the Fund relative to daily percentage changes in the Coal Futures;●to avoid being leveraged, the Fund will always attempt to invest slightly under 100% of its assets in Coal Futures, which could lead to underperformance of the Fund relative to daily percentage changes in the Coal Futures;●an imperfect correlation between the performance of Coal Futures held by the Fund and the Fund’s NAV;●bid-ask spreads;●market illiquidity or disruption;●rounding of Share prices;●the amount of Coal Futures liquidated to satisfy redemption requests;●the need to conform the Fund’s portfolio holdings to comply with investment restrictions or policies, or regulatory or tax law requirements; and●early and unanticipated closings of the markets on which the holdings of the Fund trade, resulting in the inability of the Fund to execute intended portfolio transactions.Regulatory and exchange position limits, accountability limits and other rules may restrict the creation of Baskets and the Fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective.Various commodity exchange rules impose speculative position and accountability limits on market participants trading in certain commodities.
If the Fund encounters accountability levels, position limits or price fluctuation limits for these contracts, it may not be able to create the Baskets necessary to accomplish its stated investment objective.Furthermore, certain market conditions may restrict the Fund’s ability to trade in Coal Futures, including extreme volatility or trading halts in the coal futures markets or the financial markets generally, operational issues causing dissemination of inaccurate market information, and force majeure events such as systems failure, natural or man-made disaster, act of God, armed conflict, act of terrorism, riot or labor disruption or any similar intervening circumstance.
Accordingly, if the Sponsor implements fair value methodologies to calculate the value of Coal Futures for any reason, there is a risk that the calculation of the NAV on the applicable day will be overstated or understated, which may adversely effect an investment in the Shares.An unanticipated number of redemption requests during a short period of time could have an adverse effect on the NAV.If a substantial number of requests for the redemption of Baskets are received by the Fund during a relatively short period of time, the Fund may not be able to satisfy the requests solely from the Fund’s assets not committed to trading.
The Sponsor will attempt to cause the Fund’s holdings to be posted daily at www.greenhavenfunds.com after 5:00 p.m. New York time.Investments in Coal FuturesUnder normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by purchasing Coal Futures that are traded on the CME Facilities, including smaller sized “mini” contracts (if they are available), to the greatest extent possible, without being leveraged or exceeding relevant position limits.
