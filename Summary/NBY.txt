The risks are discussed more fully in the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus immediately following this prospectus summary.These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:Risks Relating to Our Liquidity●There is uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.●We have a history of losses and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and This Offering●If ourstockholders’ equity does not meet the minimum standards of the NYSE American, we may be subject to delisting procedures.●If this offering proceeds at a common stock price under $1.81 per share, such price would trigger a price protection provision included in warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, reducing the probability and magnitude of any future share price appreciation.●Management will have broad discretion as to the use of the proceeds from this offering, and we may not use the proceeds effectively.●If you purchase securities in this offering you will experience immediate dilution in your investment.●We will require additional capital funding, and as a result you may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.●The price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, which may result in losses to our stockholders.●The volume of trading of our common stock may be low, leaving our common stock open to the risk of high volatility.10●Our amended andrestated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage a third party from making a takeover offer that is beneficial to our stockholders.●We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to paydividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.●Pioneer Group, Mr. Fu and/or China Kington might influence our corporate matters in a manner that is not in the best interest of our general stockholders.●Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.Risks Relating to the Private Placement●The Purchaser and Pioneer Group may use their influence to the detriment of our general stockholders.●The closing of the Private Placement may not occur.Risks Relating to Our Business●Our future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of Avenova.●We expect to generate revenue from sales of Avenova, which is classified as a cleared medical device by the FDA but we cannot guarantee that the FDA will continue to allow us to market and sell Avenova as a cleared medical device, which would halt our sales and marketing of Avenova and cause us to lose revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business.●Our commercialized product Avenova, like our other cleared products, are not approved by the FDA as a drug and we rely solely on the 510(k) clearance of our products as a medical device.●Wehave only limited experience in regulatory affairs, which may affect our ability or the time required to navigate complex regulatory requirements and obtain necessary regulatory clearance or approvals, if such clearances or approvals are received at all.
If we are unable to retain, recruit and hire such key employees, our ability to manage our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenue and profitability.●We rely on a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers to distribute Avenova.●If we grow and fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan.●Government agencies may establish usage guidelines that directly apply to our products or change legislation or regulations to which we are subject.●We are subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review, such as continued safety reporting requirements, and we may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations or new regulations, all of which may result in significant expense and which may limit our ability to commercialize our products.●Our products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.11●If we experience unanticipated problems with the products, if or once approved or cleared for marketing, our products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market which may have a materially adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.●If our product or products cause a reaction in a patient that causes serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntarycorrective actions or agency enforcement actions.●If our product or products cause an unexpected reaction to a patient or patients in certain ways that may have caused or contributed to serious injury, we will be subject to product liability claims.●We expect to rely on third parties to conduct any future studies of our technologies that may be required by the FDA, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily.●Our past clinical trials may expose us to expensive liability claims, and we may not be able to maintain liability insurance on reasonable terms or at all.●We operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk our products could become obsolete or uncompetitive.●Avenova faces substantial competition in the eye care markets in which we operate.●We may not be able to enhance the capabilities of our current and new products to keep pace with our industry’s rapidly changing technology and customer requirements.●Demands of third-party payors, cost reduction pressures among our customers and restrictive reimbursement practices may adversely affect our revenue.●The pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by patent litigation, and any litigation or claim against us may impose substantial costs on us, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation.●If product liability lawsuits are brought against us, they could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.●If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products similar to ours that may reduce demand for our products.●Our current patent portfolio could leave us vulnerable to larger companies who have the resources to develop and market competing products.●If physicians and patients do not accept and use our products, we will not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.●Failure to comply with laws and regulations governing the sales and marketing of our products could materially impact our revenues.●Failure to obtain and/or maintain required licenses or registrations could reduce revenue.●We are subject to U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business.●We are subject to financial reporting and other requirements that place significant demands on our resources.●A failure of our internal control over financial reporting could materially impact our business or stock price.12Company InformationWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of California on January19, 2000 as NovaCal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and subsequently changed our name to NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.If this offering proceeds at a common stock price under $1.81 per share, such price wouldtrigger a price protection provision included in warrants originally issued in July 2011, March 2015 and October 2015, reducing the probability and magnitude of any future share price appreciation.As part of our October 2015 offering, we agreed to provide certain price protections affecting currently outstanding warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 544,695 shares of our common stock, of which the warrants exercisable for 260,093 shares will expire on March 6, 2020, and the warrants exercisable for 284,602 shares will expire on October 27, 2020.Specifically, in the event that we undertake a third-party equity financing of either (1) common stock at a sale price of less than $5.00 per share; or (2) convertible securities with an exercise or conversion price of less than $5.00 per share, we have agreed to reduce the exercise price of all warrants discussed hereof to such lower price.
If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our FDA-cleared products are ineffective, make additional therapeutic claims that are not commensurate to the accepted labeling claims, or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could take a number of regulatory actions, including but not limited to, preventing us from manufacturing any or all of our devices or performing laboratory testing on human specimens, which could materially adversely affect our business.24Avenova’s FDA-clearance and our other products that have been cleared by the FDA or products that we may obtain FDA-clearance in the future, if at all, are subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed, which can reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product.
