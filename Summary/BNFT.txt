some of the important factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include:Ÿthe extent to which our products and services achieve or maintain market acceptance;Ÿour ability to introduce new products and services and enhancements to our existing products and services on a timely basis;Ÿnew competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from competitors;Ÿthe financial condition of our current and potential customers;Ÿchanges in customer budgets and procurement policies;Ÿthe amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;Ÿtechnical difficulties with our products or interruptions in our services;15Table of ContentsŸour ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, including the rate of expansion of our sales force;Ÿchanges in the regulatory environment related to benefits and healthcare;Ÿregulatory compliance costs;Ÿthe timing, size, and integration success of potential future acquisitions; andŸunforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs.In addition, a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature, and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue.
As a result, in future quarters, our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decline.Because we recognize revenue and expense relating to monthly subscriptions and professional services over varying periods, downturns or upturns in sales are
In addition, we recognize professional services expenses as incurred, which could cause professional services gross margin to be negative.We operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business and operating results will be harmed.The benefits management software market is highly competitive and is likely to attract increased competition, which could make
In addition, large insurance carriers often have internal technology staffs and proprietary software for benefits management, making them less likely to buy our solutions.The market for our products and services is immature and volatile, and if it does not develop or if it develops more slowly than we expect, the growth of our business will be harmed.The cloud-based benefits management software market is relatively new and unproven, and it is uncertain whether it will achieve and sustain high
If we fail to achieve appropriate economies of scale or if we fail to manage or anticipate the evolution and demand of the SaaS pricing model, then our business and operating results could be adversely affected.If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to consumers, employers, insurance carriers, and brokers and provide high
internationally that could adversely affect our business, including:Ÿthe need to localize and adapt our solutions for specific countries, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses;24Table of ContentsŸdata privacy laws which require that customer data be stored and processed in a designated territory;Ÿdifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;Ÿdifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;Ÿnew and different sources of competition;Ÿweaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and
data protection laws and regulations;Ÿincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;Ÿrestrictions on the transfer of funds;Ÿadverse tax consequences; andŸunstable regional economic and political conditions.If we denominate our international contracts in local currencies, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies might impact our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars.Risks Related to Our Products and Services OfferingsIf our security measures are breached or fail, and unauthorized persons gain access to customers’ and consumers’ data, our products and services might be perceived as not being secure, customers and
