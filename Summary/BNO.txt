short-term futures contract on Brent crude oil called the “Benchmark Futures Contract”, less BNO’s expenses.What is the “Benchmark Futures Contract”?The Benchmark Futures Contract is the futures contract on Brent crude oil as traded on the Ice Futures Europe Exchange (the “ICE Futures”) that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire.BNO seeks

NAV of BNO’s shares relates directly to the value of the Benchmark Futures Contracts and other assets held by BNO and fluctuations

methodology whereby each time a Creation Basket is sold, USCF purchases Crude Oil Interests, such as the Benchmark Futures Contract,
holdings, and market conditions, it may invest in Futures Contracts traded on other exchanges or invest in Other Crude Oil-Related
