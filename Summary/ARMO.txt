The success of our product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:∎successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;∎receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;∎establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;∎obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection andnon-patentexclusivity for our product candidates;∎launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;∎acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;∎effectively competing with other therapies;∎a continued acceptable safety profile of the medicines following approval; and∎enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a
