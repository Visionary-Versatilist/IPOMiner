If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.Based on current business plans and assuming no financing, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:∎the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;∎the scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;∎the cost associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval;∎the cost and timing of developing our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities, if any;∎the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;∎the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;∎our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;∎our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;∎the costs associated with being a public company; and∎the extent to which we acquire orin-licenseother product candidates and technologies.Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to

The success of our product candidates will depend on many factors, including the following:∎successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;∎receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;∎establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;∎obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection andnon-patentexclusivity for our product candidates;∎launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;∎acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;∎effectively competing with other therapies;∎a continued acceptable safety profile of the medicines following approval; and∎enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a
United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our

The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including:∎the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;∎the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial’s primary endpoints;∎the proximity of patients to study sites;∎the design of the trial;∎our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;∎clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the

other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical studies, conducting
