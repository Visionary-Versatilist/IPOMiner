judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each award grant, including the following factors:•the rights, preferences and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to our common stock;•the prices of our preferred stock sold to outside investors in arms-length transactions;•secondary transactions in our common stock;•our stage of development, operating and financial performance and revenue growth;•current business conditions and projections;•the hiring of key personnel;•the history of our company and the introduction of new products and services;43Table of Contents•the illiquid nature of our common stock;•contemporaneous or other valuations of our common stock performed by an independent valuation specialist;•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these awards, such as an initial public offering or sale of our
