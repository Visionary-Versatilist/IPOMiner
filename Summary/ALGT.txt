business model provides for diversified revenue streams, which we believe distinguishes us from other U.S. airlines and other travel companies.•Scheduled service revenuescurrently consist of nonstop flights between our leisure destinations and our small city markets.•Fixed fee contract revenuesconsist largely of fixed fee flying agreements with affiliates of Harrah's

During the period of this restriction, we will seek to reduce its effect on our operations by various means, but the restriction could result in a higher fuel cost to service our Las Vegas market or
restrict our ability to grow our Las Vegas operations if the restriction continues for an extended period of time.If our credit card processing company were to require significant holdbacks for processing credit card transactions for the purchase of air travel and other services, our cash
of our scheduled air service is sold to customers traveling from our small city markets to our leisure destinations of Las Vegas, Orlando or Tampa/St. Petersburg.
grant us approval to add aircraft to our fleet as quickly as we desire, our growth may be limited and our profitability could be adversely impacted.Any inability to acquire and maintain additional compatible aircraft, engines or parts on favorable terms or at all would increase our operating costs and could harm our
relationships could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to provide air-hotel packages in our leisure destination markets.An important component of our business success depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new, relationships with hotels and
travel purchases through supplier direct websites and/or if travel suppliers choose not to make their products and services available to us, our business may suffer.We have a significant amount of fixed obligations and we expect to incur significantly more fixed obligations which could hurt our ability to meet our strategic goals.As of December 31, 2006, maturities of our long-term debt (including capital leases) were $14.9 million in 2007, $14.2 million
meet our obligations as they become due would materially restrict our ability to grow and seriously harm our business and financial results.Our business is heavily dependent on the attractiveness of our leisure destinations and a reduction in demand for air travel to these markets would harm our business.Almost all of our scheduled flights have Las Vegas, Orlando or Tampa/St. Petersburg as either their destination or origin.
Any disruption in these systems could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and generally harm our business.Currently, our fixed fee flying business is substantially dependent on a single customer and the loss of this business could have a material adverse effect on our continuing
greater financial resources or lower operating costs.The airline industry is characterized generally by low profit margins and high fixed costs, primarily for personnel, aircraft fuel, debt service and
resulting from these actions, would likely harm our business and the airline and travel industry.Changes in government regulations imposing additional requirements and restrictions on our operations could increase our operating costs and result in service delays and
interim periods or for the year ending December 31, 2007.For the year ended December 31,For the three months ended March 31,2006200520042003200220072006(unaudited)(unaudited)(unaudited)(in thousands, except per share data)STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA:Operating revenue:Scheduled service revenues$178,349$90,664$46,236$22,515$6,007$58,231$42,693Fixed fee contract revenues33,74330,64240,98726,56916,08113,34811,286Ancillary revenues31,25811,1943,1428868912,7705,655243,350132,50090,36549,97022,17784,34959,634Operating expenses:Aircraft fuel101,56152,56827,91411,7554,76131,17924,367Salary and benefits34,95021,71815,3798,1764,32011,3247,653Station operations24,86614,09013,6088,0422,8528,6356,180Maintenance and repairs19,4829,0229,3676,1362,5896,5273,701Sales and marketing9,2935,6253,5482,3856323,0322,429Aircraft lease rentals5,1024,9873,8473,1373,0336511,629Depreciation and amortization10,5845,0882,1831,1812603,6602,226Other14,95910,9018,4416,2584,6615,0404,030Total operating expenses220,797123,99984,28747,07023,10870,04852,215Operating income (loss)22,5538,5016,0782,900(931)14,3017,419Other (income) expense:(Gain)/loss on fuel derivatives, net4,193(612)(4,438)(314)—(1,524)(268)Gain from joint venture—————(67)—Other (income) expense, net———(913)(9)63—Interest income(2,973)(1,225)(30)(9)—(1,884)(552)Interest expense5,5173,0091,3998313671,4081,405Total other (income) expense6,7371,172(3,069)(405)358(2,004)585Income (loss) before income taxes15,8167,3299,1473,305(1,289)16,3056,834Provision for income taxes7,0763712116,5581Net income (loss)$8,740$7,292$9,135$3,304$(1,290)$9,747$6,833Earnings (loss) per share:Basic$1.23$1.11$1.36$0.49$(0.14)$0.49$1.06Diluted(1)$0.52$0.56$1.36$0.49$(0.14)$0.48$0.41(1)The
