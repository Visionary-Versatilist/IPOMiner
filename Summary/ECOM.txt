Any disruption of service at these facilities could harm our business.•We rely in part on a pricing model under which a portion of the subscription fees we receive from customers is variable, based upon the amount of GMV that those customers process through our platform, and any change in the attractiveness of that model or any decline in our customers’ sales could adversely affect our financial results.•If the e-commerce market does not grow, or grows more slowly than we expect, particularly on the channels that our solutions support, demand for our solutions could be adversely affected.•Our increasing international operations subject us to increased challenges and risks.•We may need additional capital in the future to meet our financial obligations and to pursue our business objectives.
Increased competition may result in reduced pricing for our solutions, longer sales cycles or a decrease in our market share, any of which could negatively affect our revenue and future operating results and our ability to grow our business.A number of competitive factors could cause us to lose potential sales or to sell our solutions at lower prices or at reduced margins, including:•Potential customers may choose to continue using or to develop applications in-house, rather than pay for our solutions;•The channels themselves, which typically offer software tools, often for free, that allow retailers and manufacturers to connect to them, may decide to compete more vigorously with us;•Competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive sales terms, adapt more quickly to new technologies and changes in customer requirements, and devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services than we can;•Current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their products and expand their markets, and consolidation in our industry is likely to intensify.
Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:•seasonal patterns in consumer spending;•the addition of new customers or the loss of existing customers;•changes in demand for our software;•the timing and amount of sales and marketing expenses;•changes in the prospects of the economy generally, which could alter current or prospective customers’ spending priorities, or could increase the time it takes us to close sales;•changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;•costs necessary to improve and maintain our software platform; and•costs related to acquisitions of other businesses.Our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors in some future periods, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially.The seasonality of our business creates significant variance in our quarterly revenue, which makes it difficult to compare our financial results on a sequential quarterly basis.Our customers are retailers and manufacturers that typically realize a significant portion of their online sales in the fourth quarter of each year during the holiday season.
In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:•difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, services and personnel of acquired businesses, especially if those businesses operate outside of our core competency of providing e-commerce software solutions;•cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization;•ineffectiveness or incompatibility of acquired technologies or services;•failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology in order to recoup our investment;•potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;•inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of acquired businesses;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•litigation for activities of acquired businesses, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;•in the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;•costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for acquired businesses; and•increased fixed costs.If current efforts to allow states to require online retailers to collect sales tax on their behalf are successful, e-commerce in general could decline, our solutions could become less attractive and the amount of GMV processed through our platform, and our related revenue, could decline.Although current U.S. Supreme Court decisions restrict the imposition of obligations to collect state and local sales taxes with respect to remote sales, an increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to require out-of-state retailers to collect sales taxes on their behalf.
Expanding internationally may subject us to new risks that we have not faced before or increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:•recruiting and retaining employees in foreign countries;•increased competition from local providers;•compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations;•longer sales or collection cycles in some countries;•credit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;17Table of Contents•compliance with anti-bribery laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;•economic and political instability in some countries;•less protective intellectual property laws;•compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions in which we conduct business, potential double taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in applicable U.S. and foreign tax laws;•increased costs to establish and maintain effective controls at foreign locations; and•overall higher costs of doing business internationally.If our revenue from our international operations does not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results will suffer.We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.Our solutions are subject to export controls, including the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and exports of our solutions must be made in compliance with these laws.
Regardless of whether claims that we are infringing patents or other intellectual property rights have any merit, these claims are time-consuming and costly to evaluate and defend and could:•hurt our reputation;•adversely affect our relationships with our current or future customers;•cause delays or stoppages in providing our services;•divert management’s attention and resources;•require technology changes to our software that would cause us to incur substantial cost;•subject us to significant liabilities; and•require us to cease some or all of our activities.In addition to liability for monetary damages against us, which may be tripled and may include attorneys’ fees, or, in some circumstances, damages against our customers, we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our software solutions unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our services, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.We regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and patent applications, as critical to our success.
The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:•actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;•changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;•conditions or trends in our industry;•stock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the software industry;•announcements by us or our competitors of new product or service offerings, significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;•announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;•capital commitments;•investors’ general perception of our company and our business;•recruitment or departure of key personnel; and•sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.20Table of ContentsIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against technology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies’ stock.
