convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to
The initial stockholder will be required to forfeit only a number of shares of Class B common stock necessary to continue to maintain the 20.0% ownership interest in our shares of common stock after giving effect to the offering (not including the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units) and exercise, if any, of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.
The initial stockholder has agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by it in favor of any proposed business combination and (B) not to convert any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or sell any shares to us in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial business combination.10Furthermore, the founders’ shares are automatically convertible into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment pursuant to certain anti-dilution rights, as described in more detail below under the heading “Founders’ shares conversion and anti-dilution rights.”Our sponsor has committed to purchase from us an aggregate of 225,000 units, or “founders’ units,” at $10.00 per unit (for a total purchase price of $2,250,000) in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this offering.
In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the founders’ warrants will expire worthless.11Restrictions on transfer of founders’ shares and founders’ unitsOn the date of this prospectus, the founders’ shares will be placed into an escrow account maintained in New York, New York by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as escrow agent.
The limited exceptions include transfers, assignments or sales (i) to our officers, directors, consultants, advisors or their affiliates, (ii) to an entity’s members, (iii) to relatives and trusts for estate planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (vi) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (vii) by private sales made at or prior to the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased, in each case (except for clause (vi) or with our prior consent) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and to be bound by these transfer restrictions.Our sponsor has also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the founders’ units, shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units, or founders’ warrants, including the Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the founders’ warrants (except in connection with the same limited exceptions that the founders’ shares may be transferred as described above), until after the completion of our initial business combination.Founders’ shares conversion and anti-dilution rightsThe shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as provided herein.
In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the business combination, the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of this offering (not including the shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units) plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination, excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in the business combination or pursuant to units (and their underlying securities) issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans, after taking into account any shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination.
The term “equity-linked securities” refers to any debt or equity securities that are convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Class A common stock issued in a financing transaction in connection with our initial business combination, including but not limited to a private placement of equity or debt.
Unlike other blank check companies which require stockholder votes and conduct proxy solicitations in conjunction with their initial business combinations and related conversions of public shares for cash upon consummation of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law, we will have the flexibility to avoid such stockholder vote and allow our stockholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers.
We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.15We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all.Our sponsor has agreed (i) to vote any founders’ shares and shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units in favor of any proposed business combination, (ii) not to convert any such shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (iii) not to sell any such shares to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination.
As a result, we would need only 1,762,501, or approximately 35.3%, of the 5,000,000 public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of a transaction in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and all shares were present and entitled to vote at the meeting).
Any permitted transferees of such securities will be subject to the same obligations as our sponsor.None of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units in this offering or any units or shares of Class A common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of Class A common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.16Conversion rightsIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination, to demand that we convert his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account.We may also require public stockholders seeking conversion, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) physically tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
As a result, the foregoing may limit the number of shares that we can have converted and still consummate such business combination.Liquidation if no business combinationIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination by 18 months from the closing of this offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of interest that may be used by us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable, including dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Although we are required to use our reasonable best efforts to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after this offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements.
There is also no guarantee that the third parties would not challenge the enforceability of these waivers and bring claims against the trust account for monies owed them.17Our Chairman, Steven Van Dyke, has agreed that he will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that he will be able to satisfy his indemnification obligations if he is required to do so.
Additionally, the agreement entered into by Mr. Van Dyke specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity he has given: he will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Van Dyke has sufficient funds to satisfy his indemnity obligations and we have not asked Mr. Van Dyke to reserve for such indemnification obligations.The holders of the founders’ shares or shares of Class A common stock underlying the founders’ units will not participate in any redemption distribution from our trust account with respect to such founders’ shares.18If we are unable to conclude an initial business combination and we expend all of the net proceeds of this offering not deposited in the trust account, we expect that the initial per-share redemption price will be approximately $10.00 (not taking into account any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes payable and used to pay dissolution expenses).
