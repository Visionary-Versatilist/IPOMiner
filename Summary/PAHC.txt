We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.MARKET, RANKING AND OTHER INDUSTRY DATAUnless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations and market position, market opportunity and market share, is based on information from Vetnosis Limited (“Vetnosis”), a research and consulting firm specializing in global animal health and veterinary medicine, and management estimates.
Among these important risks are the following:•an expansion of the regulatory restrictions on the use of antibacterials in food-producinganimals could result in a decrease in our revenues;•a material portion of our sales and gross profits are generated by antibacterials and otherrelated products;•we face competition in each of our markets from a number of large and small companies, someof which have greater financial, R&D, production and other resources than we have;•outbreaks of animal diseases could significantly reduce demand for our products;•perceived adverse effects on human health linked to the consumption of food derived fromanimals that utilize our products could cause a decline in the sales of such products;•our business may be negatively affected by weather conditions and the availability of naturalresources;•our business is subject to risk based on customer exposure to rising costs and reduced customerincome;•the continuing trend toward consolidation of certain customer groups as well as the emergenceof large buying groups could negatively affect our sales volume and prices of our products;•advances in veterinary medical practices and animal health technologies could negatively affectdemand for our products;•the misuse or extra-label use of our products may harm our reputation or result in financial orother damages;•our multiple class structure and the concentration of our voting power with certain of ourstockholders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and conflicts of interestbetween certain of our stockholders and us or other investors could arise in the future;•anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delayacquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable; and•following the offering, we will be classified as a controlled company” and, as a result, willqualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.You will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subjectto such requirements.Recent DevelopmentsDividendOn February 26, 2014, the Board of Directors approved a $25 million pro rata dividend to be distributed to the existing holders of common shares of the Company (the “Dividend”).
We cannot predict whether resistance concerns with antibacterials will result in additional restrictions, expanded regulations or public pressure to discontinue or reduce use of antibacterials in food-producing animals, which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.A material portion of our sales are generated by antibacterials and other related products.Our medicated products business is comprised of a relatively small number of compounds and accounted for 47% and 47% of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2013 and the six months ended December 31, 2013, respectively.
The occurrence of material operational problems, including but not limited to the above events, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.A significant portion of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.Our international operations could be limited or disrupted by any of the following:•volatility in the international financial markets;•compliance with governmental controls;•difficulties enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;•compliance with a wide variety of laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations;22TABLE OF CONTENTS•compliance with foreign labor laws;•compliance with Environmental Laws;•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations,including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements;•changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to ourbusiness and the businesses of our customers;•political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities and armedconflicts;•trade restrictions, export controls and sanctions laws and restrictions on direct investments byforeign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ofthe U.S. Department of the Treasury;•changes in tax laws and tariffs;•costs and difficulties in staffing, managing and monitoring international operations; and•longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk.The multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability.In addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs.
