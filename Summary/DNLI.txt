following:•We are in the early stages of clinical drug development and have a very limited operating history and no products approved for commercial sale.•We have incurred significant net losses in each period since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.•Drug development is a highly uncertain undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.
We have never generated any revenue from product sales, and we may never generate revenue or be profitable.•If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates.•We are heavily dependent on the successful development of our BBB platform technology and the product candidates currently in our core programs, which are in the early stages of preclinical and clinical development.•We may not be successful in our efforts to continue to create a pipeline of product candidates or to develop commercially successful products.•We have concentrated our research and development efforts on the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, a field that has seen limited success in drug development.•We may encounter substantial delays in our clinical trials, or may not be able to conduct or complete our clinical trials on the timelines we expect, if at all.•We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific change, and there is a possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are
safer, more advanced or more effective than ours.•The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable.6Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•We expect to depend on collaborations with third parties for the research, development and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we may develop.•If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any product candidates we develop or for our BBB platform technology, our competitors could develop and commercialize products or technology similar or

Events that may prevent successful or timely initiation or completion of clinical trials include:•inability to generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or otherin vivoorin vitrodata to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;•delays in confirming target engagement, patient selection or other relevant biomarkers to be utilized in preclinical and clinical product candidate development;•delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design;•delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly
that raises FDA or EMA concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly; or if the FDA or EMA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives;•delays in identifying, recruiting and enrolling suitable patients to participate in our clinical trials, and delays caused by patients withdrawing from clinical trials or failing to return for post-treatment follow-up;•difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;•failure by our CROs, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical trial requirements;•failure to perform in accordance with the FDA’s or any other regulatory authority’s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, requirements, or applicable EMA or other regulatory guidelines in other countries;•occurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;•changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;20Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;•the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate;•clinical trials of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development
