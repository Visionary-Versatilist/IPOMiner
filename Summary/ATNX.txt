of the principal risks relating to our business and our ability to execute our business strategy include:•Our primary clinical candidates are still in the development stage and have not yet received regulatory approval, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.•We incurred net losses in 2015 and 2016 and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the
product candidates; these decisions may prove to have been wrong and may adversely affect our business.•Some of our drug candidates represent a novel approach to cancer treatment, which could result in delays in clinical development, heightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in our ability to achieve regulatory approval or
following marketing approval, if any.•If clinical trials of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, CFDA, or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur costs or
Our ability to generate revenue from product sales of our drug candidates depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:•complete research regarding, andnon-clinicaland clinical development of, our proprietary drug candidates;16Table of Contents•formulate appropriate dosing protocols, drug preparations and capsule encapsulation methods;•obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for drug candidates for which we complete clinical trials;•develop a sustainable and scalable manufacturing processes, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties and establishing our own manufacturing capabilities and
infrastructure;•compliantly launch and commercialize proprietary drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;•obtain market acceptance of our proprietary drug candidates and their routes of administration as viable treatment options;•obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our proprietary drug candidates from government (including U.S. federal healthcare programs) and private payors;•identify, assess, acquire and/or develop new proprietary drug candidates;•address any competing technological and market developments;•negotiate and maintain favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;•maintain, protect and expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets andknow-how;•ability to successfully commercialize our 503B outsourcing facility products and U.S. specialty pharmaceutical products;•ability to further develop our API business; and•attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.In addition, because of the numerous risks and
payors;•the amount of rebates or other price concessions we may owe under U.S. federal health care programs that cover and reimburse our proprietary drug candidates;•the amount and timing of the milestone and royalty payments we receive from our collaborators under our licensing arrangements;•the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;•selling and marketing costs associated with our potential products, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;•the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;18Table of Contents•cash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other drug candidates;•the costs of operating as a public company;•the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities;•the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments; and•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt
The success of our proprietary drug candidates will depend on several factors, including:•successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical studies;•receipt of regulatory approvals from the FDA, CFDA and other regulatory authorities for our drug candidates;•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, either by using our own facilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;•conducting our clinical trials compliantly and efficiently, and in many cases, relying on third parties to do so;•obtaining, maintaining and protecting our rights in our intellectual property, including patent, trade secrets,know-howand regulatory exclusivity;•ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of third parties;•competition with other drug candidates and drugs, including existing IV chemotherapy treatments, potential oncology biologics and other oral dosing technologies developed or being developed by competitors; and•continued acceptable safety profile for our drug candidates following regulatory approval, if and when received.If we do not achieve one or more of these requirements in accordance with our business plans or at all, we could experience significant delays
in our ability to obtain approval for and/or to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, which would materially harm our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.
