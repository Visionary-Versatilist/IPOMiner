of the principal risks relating to our business and our ability to execute our business strategy include:•Our primary clinical candidates are still in the development stage and have not yet received regulatory approval, which may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance.•We incurred net losses in 2015 and 2016 and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the
product candidates; these decisions may prove to have been wrong and may adversely affect our business.•Some of our drug candidates represent a novel approach to cancer treatment, which could result in delays in clinical development, heightened regulatory scrutiny, delays in our ability to achieve regulatory approval or
following marketing approval, if any.•If clinical trials of our drug candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, CFDA, or other regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur costs or

Under certain circumstances, such vesting may be accelerated.19Table of ContentsThe accelerated vesting of stock options and shares of restricted stock could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and lower the market price of our common stock.An impairment of goodwill could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets.

The success of our proprietary drug candidates will depend on several factors, including:•successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical studies;•receipt of regulatory approvals from the FDA, CFDA and other regulatory authorities for our drug candidates;•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, either by using our own facilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;•conducting our clinical trials compliantly and efficiently, and in many cases, relying on third parties to do so;•obtaining, maintaining and protecting our rights in our intellectual property, including patent, trade secrets,know-howand regulatory exclusivity;•ensuring we do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the patent, trade secret or other intellectual property rights of third parties;•competition with other drug candidates and drugs, including existing IV chemotherapy treatments, potential oncology biologics and other oral dosing technologies developed or being developed by competitors; and•continued acceptable safety profile for our drug candidates following regulatory approval, if and when received.If we do not achieve one or more of these requirements in accordance with our business plans or at all, we could experience significant delays
in our ability to obtain approval for and/or to successfully commercialize our drug candidates, which would materially harm our business and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to continue our operations.Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.

Delays in clinical trials, regulatory approvals or rejections of applications for regulatory approval in the U.S., Taiwan, New Zealand, China or other jurisdictions may result from many factors, including:•our inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;•regulatory requests for additional analyses, reports, data,non-clinicaland preclinical studies and clinical trials;•regulatory questions regarding interpretations of data and results and the emergence of new information regarding our drug candidates or other products;•clinical holds, other regulatory objections to commencing or continuing a clinical trial or the inability to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial in countries that require such approvals;•failure to reach agreement with the FDA, CFDA or other regulators regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;•delay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;•our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria in a clinical trial;27Table of Contents•our inability to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;•clinical sites and investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;•withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;•inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication;•failure of our third-party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;•delay or failure in adding new clinical trial sites;•ambiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;•unfavorable or inconclusive results of clinical trials and supportivenon-clinicalstudies, including unfavorable results regarding effectiveness of drug candidates during
