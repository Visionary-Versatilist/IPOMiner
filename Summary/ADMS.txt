commercialize our wholly owned product candidates, if approved, by developing a specialty CNS sales force to reach high volume prescribing neurologists and psychiatrists in the United States.Our market opportunityWe estimate that approximately 36 million people in the United States suffer from chronic CNS disorders such as Alzheimer's
are implementing our strategy by focusing on the following key objectives:•Obtain FDA approval of ADS-5102 for LID;•Develop ADS-5102 for the treatment of additional CNS indications;•Commercialize ADS-5102 by developing a specialty sales force;•Develop additional novel therapeutics based on existing CNS drugs; and•Support Forest in the NDA review and anticipated commercialization of MDX-8704.Our therapeutics portfolioOur initial product and product candidates are based on pharmacokinetic enhancements of two approved CNS drugs, amantadine and
ADS-5102, as well as Forest's successful commercialization of Namenda XR and, if approved, MDX-8704;•Our product candidates and Namenda XR require a complex manufacturing process, and there are risks associated with
a failure to meet required manufacturing specifications; Namenda XR is one of the components of Forest's fixed-dose combination product candidate MDX-8704;•We do not directly market any products, expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the foreseeable future and
or all of your investment.Risks related to our financial condition and need for additional capitalAlthough we reported net income for 2012 and 2013, we incurred significant losses in prior years and expect to incur substantial losses in the future.We are a clinical-stage specialty pharmaceutical company and do not currently directly market any products.
dyskinesia, or LID;•develop ADS-5102 for treatment of other indications in addition to LID and develop additional product candidates;•seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;•establish a specialty CNS sales force and improve our distribution and marketing capabilities to commercialize products
our agreements with manufacturers;•expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;•the level of demand for our products, should any of our product candidates receive approval, which may vary significantly;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;•the timing and success or failure of clinical studies for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any
could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue and/or earnings guidance we may provide.We may need additional funds and, if we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may have to curtail or cease operations.We are seeking to advance multiple product candidates through the research and clinical development process.
future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;•the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,
these drugs will depend on numerous factors, including:•successfully completing clinical studies for ADS-5102;•receiving marketing approvals from the FDA and, to a lesser extent, similar regulatory authorities outside the United
do, which would impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and harm our business and results of operations.14Table of ContentsEven if clinical studies demonstrate statistically significant efficacy and acceptable safety for a product, the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United
FDA were to require Forest or us to conduct additional studies of MDX-8704 or ADS-5102 to obtain approval for the product candidates in their currently contemplated indications, our business and
business, financial condition and results of operations.16Table of ContentsAny product candidate that we are able to commercialize may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage or reimbursement practices or healthcare
If we are forced to abandon development of our product candidates, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.Safety issues with Namenda XR, MDX-8704 or ADS-5102, or the parent drugs or other components of Namenda XR, MDX-8704 or ADS-5102, or with approved products of third parties
example, the absence of approved therapeutics to treat LID may require us to educate healthcare providers and patients about LID.Delays in the enrollment of patients in any of our clinical trials could increase our development costs and delay completion of the study.We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical studies for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a
stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may suffer or be more volatile.Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires,
unable to obtain non-U.S. regulatory approval to market our product candidates in other countries, we may not be able to achieve the financial results we project and our stock price could decline.Healthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates' commercial success.In the United States, there have been and we expect there will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the
eligible to receive up to an additional $55 million in payments based upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones prior to and including the first FDA approval of MDX-8704.Financial operations overviewSummaryOur revenue to date has been generated primarily from license and development revenue pursuant to our license agreement with Forest.
