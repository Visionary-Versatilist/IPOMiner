uncertainties which are discussed in more detail in the section of this prospectus entitled “Risk Factors.” The primary risks we face include:Ÿfluctuating operating results;Ÿdependence on the growth of the market for application optimized server solutions, which is new and evolving;Ÿdependence on timely new technology introductions by suppliers of server related technology, such as Intel Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices;Ÿour ability to develop and market new products; andŸour ability to compete against some of the largest global technology vendors.If we are unable to adequately address these and other challenges we face, our ability to grow our business will be negatively impacted.We were incorporated in California in September 1993.

limited to, the risks identified in this section and in particular the following factors:Ÿour focus on a single market, the market for application optimized server systems and components;Ÿour increasing focus on the sales of server systems as compared to components;Ÿthe difficulties we face in managing rapid growth in personnel and operations;Ÿthe timing and success of new products and new technologies introduced by us and our competitors;Ÿour ability to build brand awareness in a highly competitive market; andŸour ability to market new and existing products on our own and with our partners.We may not be able to successfully address any of these risks or others.
Factors that may affect quarterly operating results in the future include:Ÿour ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and increase sales to such customers;Ÿunpredictability of the timing and size of customer orders, since most of our customers purchase our products on a purchase order basis rather than pursuant to a
long term contract;Ÿfluctuations in availability and costs associated with materials needed to satisfy customer requirements;Ÿvariability of our margins based on the mix of server systems and components we sell;Ÿvariability of operating expenses as a percentage of net sales;Ÿthe timing of the introduction of new products by leading microprocessor vendors and other suppliers;Ÿour ability to introduce new and innovative server solutions that appeal to our customers;6Table of ContentsŸour ability to address technology issues as they arise, improve our products’ functionality and expand our product offerings;Ÿchanges in our product pricing policies, including those made in response to new product announcements and pricing changes of our competitors;Ÿmix of whether customer purchases are of full systems or components and whether made directly or through indirect sales channels;Ÿfluctuations based upon seasonality;Ÿthe rate of expansion, domestically and internationally;Ÿthe effectiveness of our sales force and the efforts of our distributors;Ÿthe effect of mergers and acquisitions among our competitors, suppliers or partners;Ÿgeneral economic conditions in our geographic markets; andŸimpact of regulatory changes on our cost of doing business.Accordingly, it is difficult for us to accurately forecast our growth and results of operations on a quarterly basis.
operating expenses will increase significantly during the foreseeable future as we invest in sales and marketing, research and development, manufacturing and production infrastructure, and strengthen customer service and support resources for our
operating expenses in anticipation of the growth of our business and this growth does not meet our expectations, our financial results will be negatively impacted.If our business grows, we will have to manage additional product design projects, materials procurement processes, and sales efforts and marketing for an increasing number of SKUs, as well as expand the number and
margins or the failure of our products to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our principal competitors include global technology companies such as Dell, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, International Business Machines Corporation
solutions marketed or sold under a third party brand.Many of our competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as:Ÿgreater name recognition and deeper market penetration;Ÿlonger operating histories;8Table of ContentsŸlarger sales and marketing organizations and research and development teams and budgets;Ÿmore established relationships with customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers and better channels to reach larger customer bases;Ÿlarger customer service and support organizations with greater geographic scope;Ÿa broader and more diversified array of products and services; andŸsubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources.As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements.
with distributors or expand our distribution channels or we experience unexpected changes in payment terms, inventory levels or other practices by our distributors, our business will suffer.We may be unable to accurately predict future sales through our distributors, which could harm our ability to efficiently manage our resources to match market demand.Since a significant portion of our sales are made through domestic and international distributors, our financial results, quarterly
This could adversely affect our distributors or our ability to efficiently manage or invest in internal resources, such as manufacturing and shipping capacity, to meet the demand for our products.11Table of ContentsIf we are required to change the timing of our revenue recognition, our net sales and net income could decrease.We currently record revenue based upon a “sell-in” model with revenues generally recorded upon shipment of products to our
revenue recognition policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies.”The average selling prices for our existing server solutions are subject to decline if customers do not continue to purchase our latest generation products, which could harm our results of operations.As with most electronics based products, average selling prices of servers typically are highest at the time of introduction of new
and challenges that we would otherwise not face if we conducted our business only in the United States, such as:Ÿheightened price sensitivity from customers in emerging markets;Ÿour ability to establish local manufacturing, support and service functions, and to form channel relationships with resellers in non-U.S. markets;Ÿlocalization of our systems and components, including translation into foreign languages and the associated expenses;Ÿcompliance with multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations;Ÿforeign currency fluctuations;Ÿlimited visibility into sales of our products by our distributors;Ÿlaws favoring local competitors;Ÿweaker legal protections of intellectual property rights and mechanisms for enforcing those rights;Ÿmarket disruptions created by public health crises in regions outside the U.S., such as Avian flu, SARS and other diseases;Ÿdifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, including challenges presented by relationships with workers’ councils and labor unions; andŸchanging regional economic and political conditions.These factors could limit our future international sales or otherwise adversely impact our operations.17Table of ContentsWe have recently entered into plea and settlement agreements with the government relating to violations of export
