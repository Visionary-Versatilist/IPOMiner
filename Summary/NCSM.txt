Limitations associated with traditional well completion techniques include:•inconsistent and uncontrollable placement of fractures that cannot be reliably repeated from stage to stage due to variable breakdown pressures, leading to under-stimulation of wells;•inability to monitor downhole pressure or measure pressures and temperatures during stimulation, limiting control and making optimization more challenging;•inability to close and reopen perforations and sleeves, limiting options following the initial completion; and•completion designs that result in under-stimulation of wells to reduce the likelihood of an operational issue referred to as a “screenout,” and the associated costly recovery process.To reduce the amount of under-stimulated reservoir area that can occur when using these traditional techniques, many E&P companies are
