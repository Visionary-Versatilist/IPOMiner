Some of these risks include:5●fluctuations in the value of shares based upon the price of the gold held by the Trust, which could create the potential for losses, regardless of the period of time that shares are held;●substantial sales of gold by central banks, governmental agencies and multi-lateral institutions, which could adversely affect an investment in the shares;●the fact that the Trust does not actively trade gold to take advantage of short-term market fluctuations in the price of gold;●the fact that each sale of gold by the Trust will be a taxable event for investors;●the fact that any gain recognized by a U.S. investor who or that is an individual, estate or trust attributable to a sale or exchange of shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust’s sale of any gold that the investor is treated (through his, her or its ownership of shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be subject to federal income tax at a maximum rate of 28% rather than the lower maximum rates applicable to most other long-term capital gains such an investor recognizes; and●counterparty risks associated with the Trust’s transactions with precious metals dealers to exchange the Trust’s gold for physical gold of different specifications.Principal OfficesThe offices of the Trust and the Trustee are located at 2 Hanson Place, Brooklyn, New York 11217.
