If we fail to develop and commercialize diagnostic products, we may be unable to execute our business plan.Historically, we have generated revenue from initiatives, collaborations and biomarker discovery and analysis services agreements with pharmaceutical companies and healthcare organizations.
business strategy, however, focuses on discovering, developing and commercializing diagnostic products and services based on biomarkers, and we do not expect to continue to receive significant revenue from performing biomarker discovery and analysis
provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property proves inadequate, our ability to successfully commercialize our proposed products will be harmed and we may never be able to operate our business profitably.Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods, discoveries and diagnostic tests that we develop under the patent and
failure, we may not obtain regulatory clearance for the automated version of this test or for our other diagnostic product candidates when expected, if at all.In the United States, we intend to seek FDA clearance or approval for all of our products prior to their launch for clinical use, whether offered as a diagnostic kit or laboratory service.
Some of the many factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:Øour ability to commercialize the products, if any, that we are able to develop;Øthe progress and results of our biomarker discovery and product candidate development efforts;Øactions taken by regulatory authorities with respect to our product candidates, or our sales and marketing activities;Øregulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions;Øthe outcome of legal actions to which we may become a party;Øannouncements concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;Øannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;Øchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;Øchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;Ørestatements of our financial results and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls;26Table of ContentsRisk factorsØpublication of research reports about us or the diagnostic products industry by securities or industry analysts;Øfluctuations in our operating results; andØdeviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments.The stock markets, and the markets for medical diagnostics and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced volatility that has often been

diagnostic product candidates, we expect our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to increase significantly.During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, we incurred a net loss totaling $13.8 million and used cash in operating activities totaling $9.4 million.
