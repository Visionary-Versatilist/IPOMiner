Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Antero, including, among others:·a reduction in or slowing of Antero’s development program, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our gathering and compression services;·a reduction in or slowing of Antero’s completions, which would directly and adversely impact demand for our water services;·the volatility of natural gas, NGLs and oil prices, which could have a negative effect on the value of Antero’s properties, its drilling programs or its ability to finance its operations;·the availability of capital on an economic basis to fund Antero’s exploration and development activities;·Antero’s ability to replace reserves;·Antero’s drilling and operating risks, including potential environmental liabilities;·transportation capacity constraints and interruptions;·adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation; and·losses from pending or future litigation.In late 2014, global energy commodity prices declined precipitously as a result of several factors, including an increase in worldwide commodity supplies, a stronger U.S. dollar, relatively mild weather in large portions of the U.S. during winter months, and strong competition among oil producing countries for market share.
If the IRS were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, or if we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax9Table of Contentspurposes, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced” for a further discussion of the foregoing.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas, NGLs and oil production by our customers, which could reduce the throughput on our gathering and compression systems and the number of wells for which we provide water services, which could adversely impact our revenues.All of Antero’s natural gas, NGLs and oil production is being developed from unconventional sources, such as shale formations.
Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units.Our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity-level taxation for U.S. federal, state or local income tax purposes, the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us.
