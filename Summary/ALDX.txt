We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, NS2.nBecause we have limited experience developing clinical-stage compounds, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our product candidates and business prospects.nIf we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop and commercialize NS2 and our other product candidates.nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials are not always predictive of future results.
approvals to commercialize our product candidates.nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, our planned clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect
our commercial prospects.nAny product candidate we or any of our future development partners advance into clinical trials may cause unacceptable adverse events or have other properties that may delay or prevent its regulatory approval or
product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.nWe are currently highly dependent on the services of our three senior employees and certain key consultants.nEven if we receive regulatory approval for NS2 or any other product candidate, we still may not be able to successfully commercialize it and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, could be limited.For further discussion of these and other risks you should consider before making an investment in our common stock, see the section
Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.4Table of ContentsTHE OFFERINGCommon stock offered by us3,000,000 sharesCommon stock to be outstanding after this offering9,890,021 sharesOverallotment option450,000 sharesUse of proceedsWe intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for research and development activities, including current and additional clinical trials of topically administered NS2, to develop systemic formulations of NS2, to develop novel aldehyde traps

diseased population nor has NS2 been tested in humans in any other dosage form other than an eye drop;nthere may be variability in patients, adjustments to clinical trial procedures and inclusion of additional clinical trial sites;nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance for marketing approval required by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory bodies;npatients in our clinical trials may suffer other adverse effects or die for reasons that may or may not be related to NS2;nif approved for certain diseases, NS2 will compete with well-established products already approved for marketing by the FDA, including corticosteroids and other agents that have demonstrated varying levels of efficacy
For example, to execute our business plan we will need to successfully:nexecute our product candidate development activities, including successfully completing our product design and formulation and our clinical trial programs;nobtain required regulatory approvals for our product candidates;9Table of Contentsnmanage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to the performance and completion of clinical trials, attempting to obtain regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization;nsecure substantial additional funding;ndevelop and maintain successful strategic relationships;nbuild and maintain a strong intellectual property portfolio;nbuild and maintain appropriate clinical, sales, distribution, and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties; andngain broad market acceptance for our product candidates.If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these
is costly and time consuming, and such regulation may cause unanticipated delays, or prevent the receipt of the required approvals to commercialize our product candidates.The clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing, and distribution of our
authorities can delay, limit, or deny approval of a product candidate for many reasons, including:nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our or any of our future development partners’ clinical trials;nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from trials which are conducted at clinical facilities or in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;nthe results of clinical trials may not demonstrate the safety or efficacy required by such authorities for approval;nwe or any of our future development partners may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;nsuch authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or any of our future development partners contract for clinical and commercial supplies; ornthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our or any of our future development partners’ clinical data insufficient for approval.With respect to foreign markets, approval procedures vary among countries and, in addition to the aforementioned risks, can involve additional product
or delays in the commencement or completion of, our planned clinical trials could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects.Before we can initiate clinical trials in the United States for our product candidates, we must submit the results of preclinical testing to the FDA as
The commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:nthe FDA failing to grant permission to proceed or placing the clinical trial on hold;nsubjects failing to enroll or remain in our trial at the rate we expect;nsubjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indication for which we are developing NS2 or other product candidates, or participating in competing clinical trials;nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial;nsubjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;na facility manufacturing NS2, any of our other product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities, to temporarily or permanently shut down due to
applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:nissue warning letters or untitled letters;nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements or applications filed by us;nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; ornseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of product, or request us to initiate a product recall.The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.The FDA has the authority to require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy plan as part of a NDA or after approval, which may impose further
degree of market acceptance of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:ndemonstration of clinical efficacy and safety compared to other more-established products;nthe limitation of our targeted patient population and other limitations or warnings contained in any FDA-approved labeling;nacceptance of a new formulation by health care providers and their patients;nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;nnew procedures or methods of treatment that may be more effective in treating or may reduce the incidences of SLS or other conditions for which our products are intended to treat;npricing and cost-effectiveness;nthe effectiveness of our or any future collaborators’ sales and marketing strategies;nour ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors;nunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate; andnthe willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage.If any product
