Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:•the time and cost necessary to initiate and complete our anticipated Phase 3 registration trial for AR101;•the time and cost associated with clinical trials and pre-clinical development of other product candidates;•our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and subsequently commercialize AR101 or any other product candidates we develop;•the time and cost necessary to develop clinical supplies and a commercial-scale manufacturing process for AR101;•sales and marketing costs associated with AR101, if approved, including the cost and timing of developing our sales and marketing capabilities;•the amount of sales and other revenue from AR101, if approved;•our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates;•the costs associated with any additional clinical trials of AR101;•the cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;•the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;•our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel; and•our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for AR101 or any future product candidate and the associated costs of such activities, including for filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any
If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate:•clinical trials or other development activities for AR101 or any future product candidate;•our research and development activities; or12Table of Contents•our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to commercialize AR101 or any future product candidate.Our operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results
These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:•the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development and commercialization activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time;•coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our product candidates, if approved, and potential future drugs that compete with our product candidates;•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;•expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional product candidates and technologies;•the level of demand for our products, if approved, which may vary significantly;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and•the timing and success or failure of clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our
The clinical and commercial success of AR101 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:•the results from our planned Phase 3 registration trial of AR101, and from ARC002, our ongoing open label Phase 2 clinical trial of AR101;•the frequency and severity of adverse effects of AR101;•the ability of third-party manufacturers to manufacture supplies of AR101 and to develop, validate and maintain a commercial-scale manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or
cGMP;•our ability to maintain our exclusive supply relationship with the Golden Peanut Company;•our ability to demonstrate AR101’s safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities;•whether we are required by the FDA to conduct additional clinical trials prior to the approval to market AR101 and whether the FDA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical
trials;•the receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities;•whether the FDA may require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or post-approval;•whether the FDA may restrict the use of our products to a narrow population;•our ability to successfully commercialize AR101, if approved for marketing and sale by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of AR101;•acceptance of AR101 as safe and effective by patients and the medical community;•the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;•achieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to AR101;•the effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators’ marketing, pricing, coverage and reimbursement, sales and distribution strategies and operations;•our ability to obtain issued patents that cover AR101 and to enforce such patents and other intellectual property rights in and to AR101;14Table of Contents•our ability to avoid third-party intellectual property claims; and•a continued acceptable safety profile of AR101 following approval.Many of these factors are

market AR101 for many reasons, including:•our inability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory body that AR101 is safe, pure and potent for the proposed indication;•the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may disagree with the interpretation of data from clinical trials;•our inability to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of AR101 outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;17Table of Contents•the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials;•the CROs that we retain to conduct our clinical trials may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical trials;•the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may not approve or disagree with the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of AR101;•if our BLA, if and when submitted, is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval
of our application or may recommend that the FDA require, as a condition of approval, additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;•the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may require development of a REMS as a condition of approval or post-approval;•our inability to demonstrate that the manufacturing process for AR101 is adequately controlled to ensure that all product produced meets required quality standards;•the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may fail to approve the third-party manufacturers or testing laboratories with which we contract; or•the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authorities to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.Of the large number of drugs and biologics in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or other
All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions which may cause the timing of achievement of the milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:•our available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;•the rate of progress, costs and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and collaborators, and our ability to
identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;•our receipt of approvals by the FDA and other regulatory authorities and the timing thereof;•other actions, decisions or rules issued by regulators;•our ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates;•the efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our products; and•the securing of, costs related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.If we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we expect, the commercialization of AR101 and any future product candidates may
