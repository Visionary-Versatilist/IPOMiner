These risks include, among others:•We have a limited operating history, have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.•We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.•Even if this offering is successful, we will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals.•We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, AR101, which will require significant additional clinical testing before we can seek regulatory approval and potentially launch commercial
expenditures will include costs associated with research and development, conducting nonclinical studies and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and supply, sales and marketing and general operations.
Furthermore, even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:•the time and cost necessary to initiate and complete our anticipated Phase 3 registration trial for AR101;•the time and cost associated with clinical trials and pre-clinical development of other product candidates;•our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and subsequently commercialize AR101 or any other product candidates we develop;•the time and cost necessary to develop clinical supplies and a commercial-scale manufacturing process for AR101;•sales and marketing costs associated with AR101, if approved, including the cost and timing of developing our sales and marketing capabilities;•the amount of sales and other revenue from AR101, if approved;•our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share for our product candidates;•the costs associated with any additional clinical trials of AR101;•the cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;•the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;•our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel; and•our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for AR101 or any future product candidate and the associated costs of such activities, including for filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any
These fluctuations may occur due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including:•the timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research, development and commercialization activities relating to our product candidates, which may change from time to time;•coverage and reimbursement policies with respect to our product candidates, if approved, and potential future drugs that compete with our product candidates;•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates, which may vary depending on the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;•expenditures that we may incur to acquire, develop or commercialize additional product candidates and technologies;•the level of demand for our products, if approved, which may vary significantly;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and•the timing and success or failure of clinical trials for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our
