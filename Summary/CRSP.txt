We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:•continue our current research programs and our preclinical development of product candidates from our current research programs;•seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates;•initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and choose to develop;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;•further develop our gene editing technology;•hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product candidate development;•acquire or in-license other technologies;•ultimately establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval; and•operate as a public company.As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future.
