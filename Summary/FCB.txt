Thus, certain of our loss share agreements with the FDIC begin to expire in January 2015, thus essentially converting the Covered Loans to which such agreements relate into Uncovered Loans.If we fail to effectively manage credit risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.There are risks inherent in making or purchasing any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be
Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.Economic and market developments, including the potential for inflation, may have an adverse effect on our business, possibly in ways that are not

particularly if those loans were not covered by loss sharing agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our business.11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChanges in national and local economic conditions could lead to higher loan charge-offs which could have a

potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.The FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, up to applicable limits.
Additionally, any such loss of funds could result in lower loan originations, which could materially negatively impact our growth strategy.We may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers if we do not maintain sufficient liquidity.Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost.
unfunded credit commitments in accordance with the actual borrowing needs of our clients may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.An inadequate allowance for loan losses (ALL) would reduce our earnings.Neither the loans acquired from Old Sunshine, Old FPB, or Great Florida Bank, nor any loan we originate (including loans in which we
increase, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our acquisition of assets and assumption of deposits and other liabilities of failed banks involve a number of special risks.Our acquisition of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of each of the Old Failed Banks followed the determination by these
Any such impact could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition or the market price of our Class A Common Stock.We will face additional regulatory requirements if we or the Bank have more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, which could strain our resources
factors:•our limited time running the operations of the banks from which we have acquired assets and assumed deposits and other liabilities may make it difficult to predict our future prospects and financial performance;•any adverse change in the terms of, or loss of coverage under, our loss sharing arrangements with the FDIC;•the rapid growth and evolution of our business;•quarterly variations in our results of operations or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;•changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by market analysts;26Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•any announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic alliances or joint ventures, particularly as a result of the highly acquisitive nature of our business;•changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of debt;•the use of our common stock as consideration in connection with an acquisition;•future issuances or sales, or anticipated issuances or sales, of our Class A Common Stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our Class A Common Stock;•additions or departures of key personnel;•investors’ general perception of us; and•changes in general economic, industry and market conditions in the United States, Florida or international markets.Many of these factors are beyond our control.
