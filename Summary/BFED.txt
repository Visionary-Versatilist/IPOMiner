The fair value of stock options has been estimated at $3.87 per   option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following   assumptions:  a grant-date share price   and option exercise price of $10.00; dividend yield of 0%; an expected option   life of 10 years; a risk-free interest rate of 4.65%; and a volatility rate   of 11.75% based on an index of publicly traded thrift institutions.
Our net interest rate spread decreased to 1.90% for the three months ended March 31, 2007.In addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities.
At March 31, 2007, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Office of Thrift Supervision model projects that we would experience a $19.0 million, or 35%, decrease in net portfolio value.
Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.17Our ability to successfully complete acquisitions will affect our ability to grow our franchise and compete effectively in our market areas.We have pursued a
We may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing our leverage and reducing our liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.Risks Related to this Stock OfferingThe future price of the shares of common stock may be less than the purchase price in the stock offering.We cannot assure you
Our failure to effectively use such proceeds could reduce our profits.We will use a portion of the net proceeds to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the stock offering by the employee stock ownership plan and may use the remaining net proceeds to pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase shares of common stock, purchase investment securities, deposit funds in Beacon Federal, acquire other financial services companies or for other general corporate purposes.

Further, the actual expense of the stock option plan would be determined by the grant-date fair value of the options, which would depend on a number of factors, including the valuation assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model.OverviewOur results of operations depend mainly on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our loan and investment portfolios and the interest expense we pay on our deposits and borrowings.
The increase in certificates of deposit at the expense of Federal Home Loan Bank advances reflected our preference for this source of funding as well as the development and marketing of a broader line of retail and business deposit products.Equity increased $463,000, or 1.0%, to $44.7 million at March 31, 2007 from $44.2 million at December 31, 2006.
