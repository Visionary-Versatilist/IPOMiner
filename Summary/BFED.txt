As part of the conversion, we are offering for sale in a subscription offering, and, if necessary, a community offering and a syndicated community offering, shares of common stock of Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc.Business StrategyOur business strategy is to grow and improve our profitability by:•growing and diversifying our loan portfolio by emphasizing the   origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity   loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans;•maintaining high asset quality;•emphasizing lower cost core deposits to reduce the funding costs of   new loans;•increasing our sources of non-interest income;•controlling operating expenses while continuing to provide quality   personal services to our customers; and•acquiring banks, thrifts, credit unions and financial services   companies, and branch offices.A full description of our products and services begins on page ___ of this prospectus under the heading “Business of Beacon Federal.”These strategies are intended to guide our investment of the net proceeds of the offering.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Beacon Federal Bancorp, Inc.—Business Strategy” for a further discussion of our business strategy.Reasons for the ConversionOur primary reasons for converting and raising additional capital through the offering are:•to support our internal growth through lending in communities we   serve or may serve in the future;•to enhance our existing products and services and to support the   development of new products and services;•to improve our overall competitive position;3•to provide additional financial resources to pursue future   acquisitions of banks, thrifts, credit unions and financial services   companies, and branch offices, although we have no current arrangements or   agreements with respect to any such acquisitions;•to reduce a portion of our existing borrowings;•to provide better capital management tools, including the ability to   pay dividends and to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to market   conditions; and•to retain and attract qualified personnel by establishing stock   benefit plans for management and employees, including a stock option plan, a   stock recognition and retention plan and an employee stock ownership plan.Terms of the Conversion and the OfferingUnder Beacon

The fair value of stock options has been estimated at $3.87 per   option using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following   assumptions:  a grant-date share price   and option exercise price of $10.00; dividend yield of 0%; an expected option   life of 10 years; a risk-free interest rate of 4.65%; and a volatility rate   of 11.75% based on an index of publicly traded thrift institutions.
The actual expense of the stock option   plan will be determined by the grant-date fair value of the options, which   will depend on a number of factors, including the valuation assumptions used in   the option pricing model ultimately adopted which may or may not be   Black-Scholes.(2)The stock option plan and stock recognition and retention plan may   award a greater number of options and shares, respectively, if the plans are   adopted more than twelve months after the completion of the conversion.The actual

of conversion has been set for September 26, 2007;•we have received orders to purchase at least the minimum number of   shares of common stock offered; and•we receive final approval of the Office of Thrift Supervision to   complete the conversion and the offering.How You Can Obtain Additional InformationOur branch
At March 31, 2007, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Office of Thrift Supervision model projects that we would experience a $19.0 million, or 35%, decrease in net portfolio value.
See “Management of Beacon Federal Bancorp , Inc.—Benefit Plans—Employment Agreements.”If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans.
The acquisition of other institutions also typically requires the integration of different corporate cultures, loan and deposit products, pricing strategies, data processing systems and other technologies, accounting, internal audit and financial reporting systems, operating systems and internal controls, marketing programs and personnel of the acquired institution, in order to make the transaction economically advantageous.
We may finance acquisitions with borrowed funds, thereby increasing our leverage and reducing our liquidity, or with potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities.Risks Related to this Stock OfferingThe future price of the shares of common stock may be less than the purchase price in the stock offering.We cannot assure you
value of our shares of common stock.We will need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements.Upon
Stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest totaling 12.9% in the event newly issued shares are used to fund stock options or awards of shares of common stock under these plans in an amount equal to 10% and 4%, respectively, of the shares issued in the stock offering.We will enter into employment and change-in-control agreements that may increase our compensation costs.We intend to enter into employment agreements with each of Messrs.
Our failure to effectively use such proceeds could reduce our profits.We will use a portion of the net proceeds to finance the purchase of shares of common stock in the stock offering by the employee stock ownership plan and may use the remaining net proceeds to pay dividends to stockholders, repurchase shares of common stock, purchase investment securities, deposit funds in Beacon Federal, acquire other financial services companies or for other general corporate purposes.
Beacon Federal may use the proceeds it receives to fund new loans, establish or acquire new branches, purchase investment securities, reduce a portion of our borrowings, or for general corporatepurposes.
While we will attempt before completion of the offering to obtain commitments from at least two other broker-dealers to make a market in shares of our common stock, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such commitments.21We may take other actions to meet the minimum required sales of shares if we cannot find enough purchasers in the community.If we do not sell enough shares to reach the minimum of the offering range through the subscription and community offerings, shares may be offered for sale to the general public in a syndicated community offering to be managed by Keefe Bruyette & Woods, acting as our agent.
