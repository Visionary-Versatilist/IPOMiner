Before making a4Table of Contentsdecision to invest in Class A common stock, you should carefully consider all of those risks, including the following:•We have incurred significant losses since our inception and have generated limited revenue to date, and we may not be able to maintain profitability.•Demand for our tools is subject to substantial variation due to the cyclic nature of the chip industry.•The commercial success of our tools requires that we demonstrate the differentiated, innovative nature of our technology to gain acceptance by leading chip manufacturers and then leverage our reputation to gain market
existing relationships with our potential customers.•We depend on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue and the number of potential customers for our tools is limited, so the loss of a major customer could harm our financial condition.•Our success depends on our ability to protect the intellectual property of our SAPS and TEBO technologies and to combat infringement from competitors who may try to replicate our technologies.Preliminary Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017Our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 are not yet available.

Our ability to generate significant product revenue from our current tools or future tool candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:•achieve market acceptance of Ultra C equipment based on SAPS technology as well as Ultra C equipment based on TEBO technology;•increase our customer base, including the establishment of relationships with companies in the United States;•continue to expand our supplier relationships with third parties; and•establish and maintain our reputation for providing efficienton-timedelivery of high quality products.If we fail to regain and sustain profitability on a continuing basis, we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be

Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by a variety of factors, including:•the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the related impact on the purchase of equipment used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, or chips;•the timing of purchases of our tools by chip fabricators, which order types of tools based on multi-year capital plans under which the number and dollar amount of tool purchases can vary significantly from year to year;•the relatively high average selling price of our tools and our dependence on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in any period, whereby the timing and volume of purchase orders or
cancellations from our customers could significantly reduce our revenue for that period;•the significant expenditures required to customize our products often exceed the deposits received from our customers;•the lead time required to manufacture our tools;•the timing of recognizing revenue due to the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools;•our ability to sell additional tools to existing customers;•the changes in customer specifications or requirements;•the length of our product sales cycle;•changes in our product mix, including the mix of systems, upgrades, spare parts and service;•the timing of our product releases or upgrades or announcements of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors, including changes in customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements;•our ability to enhance our tools with new and better functionality that meet customer requirements and changing industry trends;•constraints on our suppliers’ capacity;•the timing of investments in research and development related to releasing new applications of our technologies and new products;•delays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and the market acceptance of these products when introduced;•our ability to control costs, including operating expenses and the costs of the components and subassemblies used in our products;•the costs related to the acquisition and integration of product lines, technologies or businesses; and14Table of Contents•the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, including defending our intellectual property against third-party claims or litigation.Seasonality has played an increasingly important role in the market for chip manufacturing tools.

acceptance for our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:•our ability to demonstrate the differentiated, innovative nature of our SAPS and TEBO technologies and the advantages of our tools over those of our competitors;•compatibility of our tools with existing or potential customers’ manufacturing processes and products;•the level of customer service available to support our products; and•the experiences our customers have with our products.In addition, obtaining orders from new
If we are unable to obtain new customers and continue to achieve widespread market acceptance of our tools, then our business, operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.If we do not continue to enhance our existing single-wafer wet cleaning tools and achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to compete effectively.We operate in an industry that is subject to evolving standards, rapid technological changes and changes in customer demands.
cleaning equipment is subject to a wide variety of challenges during the tool’s development, including the following:•accurate anticipation of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;•the availability of qualified product designers and technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;•our ability to design products that meet chip manufacturers’ cost, size, acceptance and specification criteria, and performance requirements;•the ability and availability of suppliers and third-party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver the critical components and subassemblies of our tools in a timely manner;•market acceptance of our customers’ products, and the lifecycle of those products; and•our ability to deliver products in a timely manner within our customers’ product planning and deployment cycle.Certain enhancements to our Ultra C equipment in future periods may reduce demand for ourpre-existingtools.
These quality problems could harm our reputation as well as our customer relationships in the following ways:•our customers may delay or reject acceptance of our tools that contain defects or fail to meet their specifications;•we may suffer customer dissatisfaction, negative publicity and reputational damage, resulting in reduced orders or otherwise damaging our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers;•we may incur substantial costs as a result of warranty claims or service obligations or in order to enhance the reliability of our tools;•the attention of our technical and management resources may be diverted;•we may be required to replace defective systems or invest significant capital to resolve these problems; and•we may be required to write off inventory and other assets related to our tools.In addition,
costs associated with warranty claims, could harm our reputation and could cause customers to decline to place new or additional orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on third parties to manufacture significant portions of our tools and our failure to manage our relationships with these parties could harm our

downturns could cause material adverse changes to our results of operations and financial condition including:•a decline in demand for our products;•an increase in reserves on accounts receivable due to our customers’ inability to pay us;25Table of Contents•an increase in reserves on inventory balances due to excess or obsolete inventory as a result of our inability to sell such inventory;•valuation allowances on deferred tax assets;•restructuring charges;•asset impairments including the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;•a decline in the value of our investments;•exposure to claims from our suppliers for payment on inventory that is ordered in anticipation of customer purchases that do not come to fruition;•a decline in the value of certain facilities we lease to less than our residual value guarantee with the lessor; and•challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.Fluctuating levels of
