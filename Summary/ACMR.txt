Before making a4Table of Contentsdecision to invest in Class A common stock, you should carefully consider all of those risks, including the following:•We have incurred significant losses since our inception and have generated limited revenue to date, and we may not be able to maintain profitability.•Demand for our tools is subject to substantial variation due to the cyclic nature of the chip industry.•The commercial success of our tools requires that we demonstrate the differentiated, innovative nature of our technology to gain acceptance by leading chip manufacturers and then leverage our reputation to gain market
existing relationships with our potential customers.•We depend on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue and the number of potential customers for our tools is limited, so the loss of a major customer could harm our financial condition.•Our success depends on our ability to protect the intellectual property of our SAPS and TEBO technologies and to combat infringement from competitors who may try to replicate our technologies.Preliminary Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017Our consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 are not yet available.

Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by a variety of factors, including:•the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry and the related impact on the purchase of equipment used in the manufacture of integrated circuits, or chips;•the timing of purchases of our tools by chip fabricators, which order types of tools based on multi-year capital plans under which the number and dollar amount of tool purchases can vary significantly from year to year;•the relatively high average selling price of our tools and our dependence on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue in any period, whereby the timing and volume of purchase orders or
cancellations from our customers could significantly reduce our revenue for that period;•the significant expenditures required to customize our products often exceed the deposits received from our customers;•the lead time required to manufacture our tools;•the timing of recognizing revenue due to the timing of shipment and acceptance of our tools;•our ability to sell additional tools to existing customers;•the changes in customer specifications or requirements;•the length of our product sales cycle;•changes in our product mix, including the mix of systems, upgrades, spare parts and service;•the timing of our product releases or upgrades or announcements of product releases or upgrades by us or our competitors, including changes in customer orders in anticipation of new products or product enhancements;•our ability to enhance our tools with new and better functionality that meet customer requirements and changing industry trends;•constraints on our suppliers’ capacity;•the timing of investments in research and development related to releasing new applications of our technologies and new products;•delays in the development and manufacture of our new products and upgraded versions of our products and the market acceptance of these products when introduced;•our ability to control costs, including operating expenses and the costs of the components and subassemblies used in our products;•the costs related to the acquisition and integration of product lines, technologies or businesses; and14Table of Contents•the costs associated with protecting our intellectual property, including defending our intellectual property against third-party claims or litigation.Seasonality has played an increasingly important role in the market for chip manufacturing tools.
