To achieve our goal, we plan to:•apply our proprietary, next generation AAV vector technology to developin vivogene therapies for patients;•focus on rapidly advancing our internal lead proprietary development programs in our core therapeutic areas of metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal diseases;•expand to additional product candidates in our core therapeutic areas once proof-of-concept is established;•further grow the pipeline of products based on our NAV Technology Platform through strategic in-licensing and sublicensing of new programs; and•maintain and grow our extensive intellectual property portfolio.3Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our BusinessOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section titled “Risk Factors”
trials that their programs are safe and effective, which may lead to a perception, whether accurate or not, that our NAV Technology is of limited value.•We may not be successful in our efforts to identify or discover additional product candidates.•We rely primarily on a sponsored research agreement with The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania for our nonclinical research and development activities and a loss of this relationship or of the principal
arrangements are not successful, our business could be harmed.•Our rights to license our NAV Technology Platform and to develop and commercialize our product candidates are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.•Gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture.
otherwise harm our business.•If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and, as a result, our stock price may decline.•In preparation for this offering, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

broad a marketing approval as we seek, and the FDA and the EMA or other regulatory authorities may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or evaluate subjects for an additional follow-up period.While we believe our Lead Product Candidates should be applicable for the treatment of patients with MPS I, MPS II, wet AMD, XLRP and
business in foreign countries, including:•difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (CROs) and physicians;•different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;•absence in some countries of established groups with sufficient regulatory expertise for review of gene therapy protocols;•our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and•the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or
Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of preclinical and clinical development include:•delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;•delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;•delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent Ethics Committee approval at each clinical trial site;•delays in recruiting suitable subjects to participate in our clinical trials;•imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites;•failure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;•failure to perform in accordance with the FDA good clinical practice (GCP), or applicable regulatory guidelines in the European Union and other countries;•delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites, including delays by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions;•delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•clinical trial sites or subjects dropping out of a trial;15Table of Contents•selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;•occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;•occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; or•changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.Any inability to successfully complete research studies, preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or
market acceptance of our NAV Technology Platform and our product candidates and could materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.17Table of ContentsWe may be unable to obtain orphan drug designation or exclusivity.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, and as, we:•further develop our sublicensing activities and NAV Technology Platform;•continue our research studies and preclinical development of our internal product candidates, including our Lead Product Candidates;•initiate additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our Lead Product Candidates and future product candidates, if any;•initiate activities relating to manufacturing;•seek to identify additional product candidates;•prepare our BLA and MAA for our Lead Product Candidates and seek marketing approvals for any of our other product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;22Table of Contents•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any;•operate as a public company;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and•acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.For us to become profitable,
