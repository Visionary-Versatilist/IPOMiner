We attribute our return to profitability, in large part, to the following:●Werestructured the board of trustees (hereafter referred to throughout this document as the board of directors), adding individuals with attributes more suited for the banking industry than those members who previously sat on the board of the institution as a credit union.2●A new executive management team was put in placeand a number ofotherseasoned bankerswere hired since our conversion to a mutual savings bank.●Aggressivecost cutting measures wereput in place, including(i)salary reductions or freezes for a number of our seniorstaff, (ii)reduced employee benefits; (iii) staff reductionsand(iv)consolidation of our branch network.●Active management of our delinquent loans and non-performing assets.See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information.1st Security Bank of Washington is a diversified lender with a focus on the origination of home improvement loans, commercial real estate mortgage loans, commercial business loans and second mortgage/home equity loan products.
After the conversion and offering, we plan to continue our strategy of:●Growing and diversifying our loan portfolio and revenue streamsby expanding our commercial real estate, commercial business and residential construction lending operations, and reintroducing in-house originations of residential mortgage loans through a mortgage banking program.●Maintaining and improving asset quality, including actively managing our delinquent loans and non-performing assets by aggressively pursuing the collection of consumer debts and marketing saleable properties upon which we foreclosed or repossessed.●Emphasizing lower cost core depositsto reduce the costs of funding our loan growth.In order to build our core deposit base, we provide sales promotions on savings and checking accounts and diligently attempt to recruit all commercial loan customers to maintain a deposit relationship with us, generally a business checking account relationship, for the term of their loan.●Capturing our customers’ full relationshipby offering a wide range of products and services.

For further information about the role of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in the offering, see “The Conversion and Stock Offering - Marketing Arrangements.”Reasons for the Conversion and OfferingThe primary reasons for the conversion and our decision to conduct the offering are to:●increase our capital to support future growth; and●provide us with greater operating flexibility and allow us to better compete with other financial institutions.The conversion and the capital raised in the offering are expected to:●give us the financial strength to grow our bank;●better enable us to serve our customers in our market area;●enable us to increase lending and support our emphasis on commercial business and commercial real estate lending and the development of new products and services;●help us attract and retain qualified management through stock-based compensation plans; and●structure our business in a form that will enable us to access the capital markets.We recently signed a notice of intent for a new branch location in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, which is expected to open during the third quarter of 2012; otherwise, we do not have any specific plans or arrangements for expanding our branch network and/or any specific acquisition plans.How We Determined the Offering Range and the $10.00 Price Per ShareValuation Range and Background.The amount of common stock we are offering is based on an independent appraisal by RP Financial, LC.

Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.24Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following:●the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top-quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;●the ability to expand our market position;●the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;●the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;●customer satisfaction with our level of service; and●industry and general economic trends.Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors:●general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market area, that are worse than expected;●the credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write offs and changes in our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses that may be impacted by deterioration in the housing and commercial real estate markets;●fluctuations in the demand for loans, the number of unsold homes, land and other properties and fluctuations in real estate values in our market area;●increases in premiums for deposit insurance;●the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation;●changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our interest margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;●increased competitive pressures among financial services companies;●our ability to execute our plans to grow our residential construction lending, our mortgage banking operations and our warehouse lending and the geographic expansion of our indirect home improvement lending;●our ability to attract and retain deposits;●our ability to control operating costs and expenses;●changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;●our ability to successfully manage our growth;●legislative or regulatory changes that adversely affect our business, including the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act, changes in regulation policies and principles, or the interpretation of regulatory capital or other rules;●adverse changes in the securities markets;●changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the Financial Accounting Standards Board;●costs and effects of litigation, including settlements and judgments;38●inability of key third-party vendors to perform their obligations to us; and●other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services and other risks described elsewhere in this prospectus.Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this prospectus and in other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong because of inaccurate assumptions we might make, because of the factors illustrated above or because of other factors that we cannot foresee.
