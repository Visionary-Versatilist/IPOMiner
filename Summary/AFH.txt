Insurance regulations are generally designed to protect policyholders rather than shareholders, and are related to matters including:13•rate setting;•Risk Based Capital (RBC) ratio and solvency requirements;•restrictions on the amount, type, nature, quality and quantity of securities and other investments in which insurers may invest;•the maintenance of adequate reserves for unearned premiums and unpaid, and incurred but not reported, claims;•restrictions on the types of terms that can be included in insurance policies;•standards for accounting;•marketing practices;•claims settlement practices;•the examination of insurance companies by regulatory authorities, including periodic financial and market conduct examinations;•requirements to comply with medical privacy laws as a result of our administration of Gateway's run-off workers' compensation business;•the licensing of insurers and their agents;•limitations on dividends and transactions with affiliates;•approval of certain reinsurance transactions;•insolvency proceedings;•ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets, cancel policies or non-renew policies; and•data privacy.Such laws, regulations and rules increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
In addition, economic and financial market turmoil or other conditions, circumstances or events may result in U.S. federal oversight of the insurance industry in general.Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.We may, from time to time, be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:•disputes over coverage or claims adjudication, including claims alleging that we or our insurance subsidiaries have acted in bad faith in the administration of claims by our policyholders;•disputes regarding sales practices, disclosure, policy issuance and cancellation, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements;•limitations on the conduct of our business;•disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation or the termination of our contracts with such agents, producers or network providers, including any alleged claim that they may make against us in connection with a dispute whether in the scope of their agreements or otherwise;•disputes with taxing authorities regarding tax liabilities; and•disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us.As insurance industry practices and regulatory, judicial and industry conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to pricing, claims, coverage and business practices may emerge.
These changes may limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to price automobile insurance adequately and could require us to discontinue unprofitable product lines, make unplanned modifications of our products and services, or result in delays or cancellations of sales of our products and services.Strategic RisksOur geographic concentration ties our performance to the business, economic, regulatory and other conditions of certain states.Some jurisdictions (including, most notably New York, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota) generate a more significant percentage of our total premiums than others.
Growth may also place a strain on management systems and operational and financial resources, and such systems, procedures and internal controls may not be adequate to support operations as they expand.16The integration and management of acquired books of business, acquired businesses and other growth initiatives involve numerous risks that could adversely affect our profitability, and are contingent on many factors, including:•expanding our financial, operational and management information systems;•managing our relationships with independent agents, brokers, and legacy program managers, including maintaining adequate controls;•expanding our executive management and the infrastructure required to effectively control our growth;•maintaining ratings for certain of our insurance subsidiaries;•increasing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth in written premiums;•accurately setting claims provisions for new business where historical underwriting experience may not be available;•obtaining regulatory approval for appropriate premium rates where applicable; and•obtaining the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or to expand into additional states or other jurisdictions.Our failure to grow our premiums written or to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of our products in the New York City market are distributed by a single agent, and any decrease in the amount of our products distributed by this agent, or underperformance of the book of business controlled by this agent, could adversely impact our business.In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented our New York “excess taxi program” with a single agent writing business in the New York City market, which was a new business arrangement to provide excess coverage above the levels of risk retained by the insured.
The objective of A.M. Best’s rating system is to provide potential policyholders and other interested parties an opinion of an insurer’s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations, including paying claims.On January 30, 2013, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating of American Country and American Service as “B” and the outlook assigned to all ratings is “Stable.” Upon the completion of our acquisition of Gateway, A.M. Best affirmed our rating to B “stable.”The review reflects the inherent risk associated with integrating Gateway’s ongoing business into the Company’s existing infrastructure, while overseeing the run-off of Gateway’s non-core lines, and the increase in financial leverage of Atlas as a result of funding the transaction, in part, with the issuance of preferred stock.
If our company were not to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain tax inefficiencies and adverse tax consequences and reporting requirements would result for both our company and the recipients and holders of stock in our company, including that dividend distributions from our insurance subsidiaries to us would be subject to 30% U.S. withholding tax, with no available reduction and that members of the consolidated group may not be permitted to file a consolidated U.S. tax return resulting in the acceleration of cash tax outflow and potential permanent loss of tax benefits associated with net operating loss carry-forwards that could have otherwise been utilized.Our use of losses may be subject to limitations and the tax liability of our company may be increased.Our ability to utilize the NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC Section 382”).
There is a risk that the per share trading price of our ordinary shares will fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our ordinary shares include:•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;•changes in our cash flows from operations or earnings estimates;•publication of research reports about us or the insurance industry;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•adverse market reaction to any debt we incur or equity we may issue in the future;•additions or departures of key management personnel;•actions by institutional shareholders;•speculation in the press or investment community;•our underlying asset value;•the extent of investor interest in our securities;•investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;•changes in tax laws;•failure to meet earnings estimates;•changes in our claims-paying ratings;•general market and economic conditions; and21•future sales of substantial amounts of our shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur.In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their shares.
We are under no duty to update any of these forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations.Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the matters described under “Risk Factors,” changes in local, regional, national or global political, economic, business, competitive, market (supply and demand) and regulatory conditions and the following:•expectations regarding our potential growth;•our inability to have our securities listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market or another national securities exchange, or once initially listed, to maintain such listings;•our financial performance;•our competitive position;•the introduction and proliferation of competitive products;•an inability to achieve sustained profitability;•failure to implement our short- or long-term growth strategies;•operating and capital expenditures by us and the insurance and reinsurance industry;•the cost of retaining and recruiting our key personnel or the loss of such key personnel;•risks associated with the expansion of our business in size and geography;•risks associated with our new “excess taxi” program written by a single agent in New York;•operational risk;•risks associated with our integration of Gateway;•geopolitical events and regulatory changes;•changing interpretations of generally accepted accounting principles;•general economic conditions;•our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary;•the adverse effect our the ordinary shares issued pursuant to this offeringmay have on the market price of our ordinary shares;•our business strategies;•compliance with applicable laws; and•our liquidity.Any forward-looking statement made by us in this prospectus speaks only as of the date on which we make it, and is expressly qualified in its entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements.

The following table identifies the adjustments to the statement of comprehensive income as a result of removing the impacts of the truck line of business as if this line were already in run-off as of January 1, 2012.For the Year Ended(in ‘000s)December 31, 2012Net premiums earned$(5,011)Investment Income(90)Realized (gains) losses(57)Other expense42Net claims incurred(8,086)Other underwriting expenses(1,713)Total expenses(9,799)Income from operations before income tax (benefit)/expense$4,6836.Camelot Services recorded loss and loss adjustment expense development of $8.9 million in its December 31, 2012 financial statement that related to periods prior to 2012.
A reversal adjustment was made to the income tax line of the pro forma statement of comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2012 in the amount of $2.9 million to eliminate the impact of this adjustment.8.Accrued dividends were adjusted by $90,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012 to reflect the issuance of $2.0 million of Atlas preferred shares to Hendricks.34MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (September 30, 2013)The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this document.In this discussion and analysis, the term “common share” refers to the summation of restricted voting shares and ordinary voting shares when used to describe loss or book value per common share.Forward-looking statementsThis report contains “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to estimates of future expenses, revenue and profitability; trends affecting financial condition, cash flows and results of operations; the availability and terms of additional capital; dependence on key suppliers and other strategic partners; industry trends; the competitive and regulatory environment; the successful integration of Gateway; the impact of losing one or more senior executives or failing to attract additional key personnel; and other factors referenced in this report.Often, but not always, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “plans”, “expects”, “is expected”, “budget”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates”, or “believes” or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases, or state that certain actions, events or results “may”, “could”, “would”, “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved.
