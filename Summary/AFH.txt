In that event, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.The insurance subsidiaries’ provisions for unpaid claims may be inadequate, which would result in a reduction in our net income and might adversely affect our financial condition.Our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess and price the risks covered by the insurance policies that we write.
Insurance regulations are generally designed to protect policyholders rather than shareholders, and are related to matters including:13•rate setting;•Risk Based Capital (RBC) ratio and solvency requirements;•restrictions on the amount, type, nature, quality and quantity of securities and other investments in which insurers may invest;•the maintenance of adequate reserves for unearned premiums and unpaid, and incurred but not reported, claims;•restrictions on the types of terms that can be included in insurance policies;•standards for accounting;•marketing practices;•claims settlement practices;•the examination of insurance companies by regulatory authorities, including periodic financial and market conduct examinations;•requirements to comply with medical privacy laws as a result of our administration of Gateway's run-off workers' compensation business;•the licensing of insurers and their agents;•limitations on dividends and transactions with affiliates;•approval of certain reinsurance transactions;•insolvency proceedings;•ability to enter and exit certain insurance markets, cancel policies or non-renew policies; and•data privacy.Such laws, regulations and rules increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
In addition, economic and financial market turmoil or other conditions, circumstances or events may result in U.S. federal oversight of the insurance industry in general.Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.We may, from time to time, be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:•disputes over coverage or claims adjudication, including claims alleging that we or our insurance subsidiaries have acted in bad faith in the administration of claims by our policyholders;•disputes regarding sales practices, disclosure, policy issuance and cancellation, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements;•limitations on the conduct of our business;•disputes with our agents, producers or network providers over compensation or the termination of our contracts with such agents, producers or network providers, including any alleged claim that they may make against us in connection with a dispute whether in the scope of their agreements or otherwise;•disputes with taxing authorities regarding tax liabilities; and•disputes relating to certain businesses acquired or disposed of by us.As insurance industry practices and regulatory, judicial and industry conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to pricing, claims, coverage and business practices may emerge.
Growth may also place a strain on management systems and operational and financial resources, and such systems, procedures and internal controls may not be adequate to support operations as they expand.16The integration and management of acquired books of business, acquired businesses and other growth initiatives involve numerous risks that could adversely affect our profitability, and are contingent on many factors, including:•expanding our financial, operational and management information systems;•managing our relationships with independent agents, brokers, and legacy program managers, including maintaining adequate controls;•expanding our executive management and the infrastructure required to effectively control our growth;•maintaining ratings for certain of our insurance subsidiaries;•increasing the statutory capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth in written premiums;•accurately setting claims provisions for new business where historical underwriting experience may not be available;•obtaining regulatory approval for appropriate premium rates where applicable; and•obtaining the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or to expand into additional states or other jurisdictions.Our failure to grow our premiums written or to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.A significant portion of our products in the New York City market are distributed by a single agent, and any decrease in the amount of our products distributed by this agent, or underperformance of the book of business controlled by this agent, could adversely impact our business.In the third quarter of 2012, we implemented our New York “excess taxi program” with a single agent writing business in the New York City market, which was a new business arrangement to provide excess coverage above the levels of risk retained by the insured.
There is a risk that the per share trading price of our ordinary shares will fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our ordinary shares include:•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;•changes in our cash flows from operations or earnings estimates;•publication of research reports about us or the insurance industry;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•adverse market reaction to any debt we incur or equity we may issue in the future;•additions or departures of key management personnel;•actions by institutional shareholders;•speculation in the press or investment community;•our underlying asset value;•the extent of investor interest in our securities;•investor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;•changes in tax laws;•failure to meet earnings estimates;•changes in our claims-paying ratings;•general market and economic conditions; and21•future sales of substantial amounts of our shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur.In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their shares.
