Surgeons may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:•lack of experience with our technologies;•existing relationships with competitors and sales representatives that sell competitive products;•lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;•perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;•less attractive availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems compared to other products and techniques;•costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment; and•the time commitment that may be required for training.15Table of ContentsIn addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential spine
coverage and reimbursement may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.Competition in the spinal surgery industry has increased as a result of new market entrants, new technologies and as more established companies have intensified competitive pricing
Our failure to receive such approvals, and any adverse changes in coverage and the reimbursement policies of foreign third-party payors, would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in such international markets.The safety and efficacy of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our
meet demand on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of our products to meet market demand and, as a result, could lose customers, our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer.Our dependence on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability and delivery
Any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.If we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct sales employees, independent sales agencies and international distributors, we may not be able to generate anticipated
independent sales agencies fails to increase over time in line with our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the individuals who make up that network.
investments, licenses or other strategic alliances, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.Our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands, competitive pressures, technologies and market
Potential and completed acquisitions, strategic investments, licenses and other alliances involve numerous risks, including:•problems assimilating the purchased or licensed technologies, products or business operations;•issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;•unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions or strategic alliances;•diversion of management’s attention from our core business;•adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;•potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and•increased legal and accounting compliance costs.We do not know if we will be able to identify acquisitions or strategic relationships we deem suitable, whether we will be able to successfully complete any such transactions on favorable
attempt to promote and maintain our brand, our products may not be accepted by spine surgeons, which would cause our sales to decrease and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Fluctuations in insurance cost and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.We hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors’ and officers’
jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Even after clearance or approval for our products is obtained, we are subject to extensive post-market regulation by the FDA.
Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•market acceptance of our products;•the revenue generated by sales of our products;•the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;•the expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;•the costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;•the scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials;•the cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of our products and products in development;•the costs associated with complying with state, federal and international transparency laws;•the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights;•the cost of defending, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patent or other intellectual property
to support surgeries; and•unanticipated general and administrative expenses.As a result of these factors, we may seek to raise additional capital to:•maintain appropriate product inventory levels;•fund our operations and clinical trials;•continue our research and development;42Table of Contents•defend, in litigation or otherwise, any claims that we infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property rights;•address FDA or other governmental, legal/enforcement actions and remediate underlying problems;•commercialize our new products, if any such products receive regulatory clearance or approval for sale; and•acquire companies and license products or intellectual property.Such capital may not be available on favorable terms, or at all.
