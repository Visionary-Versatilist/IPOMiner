The timing of our need for additional funds will depend on a number of factors, which factors are difficult to predict or may be outside of our control, including:•the resources, time and costs required to initiate and complete our research and development, to initiate and complete preclinical studies and clinical trials and to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates;​•progress in our research and development programs;​•the timing, receipt and amount of milestone, royalty and other payments from future collaborators, if any; and​•costs necessary to protect our intellectual property.​If our estimates and predictions relating to any of these factors are incorrect, we may need to modify our operating plan.
If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more clinical research or development programs, which would adversely impact potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition.If we raise additional capital through future collaborations, strategic alliances or third-party licensing arrangements, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.14TABLE OF CONTENTSIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.If we are unable to use carryforward tax losses or benefit from favorable tax legislation to reduce our taxes, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.We have incurred significant net operating losses since our inception in July 2014.
Even if we are successful in developing such products, there is no certainty that our products, when developed, will be found to be sufficiently effective and safe for use to receive regulatory approval for marketing, which would adversely impact our potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition.15TABLE OF CONTENTSEven if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.
We are currently preparing for Phase III clinical trials and our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, products will depend on several factors, including the following:•further ascertaining the FDA’s expectations with respect to the nonclinical and clinical testing requirements across the development programs;​•successful completion of our current clinical trials or other clinical trials, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;​•successful achievement of the objectives of planned clinical trials, including manufacturability qualification of devices;​•receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the U.S.;​•establishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;​•establishing a manufacturing and commercial infrastructure;​•acceptance of the products by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;​•establishing market share while competing with other therapies;​•successfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;​•a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the products following regulatory approval; and​•qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the products.​Our business strategy is to develop several pipeline product candidates over the next approximately two to three years which will require additional clinical and nonclinical development, regulatory review and approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales.
The completion of any of these clinical trials may be delayed or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:•the FDA, institutional review boards, or IRB, the European Union regulatory authorities, or the European Medicines Agency, and national authorities, or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or place a clinical trial on hold;​•patients do not enroll in a clinical trial or results from patients are not received at the expected rate;​•patients discontinue participation in a clinical trial prior to the scheduled endpoint set forth in the clinical protocol at a higher than expected rate, especially if such discontinuations interfere with our ability to assess the efficacy of our drug candidate;​•patients experience adverse events from our treatment;​•patients get hurt during a clinical trial for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates, including the advanced stage of their disease and other medical problems;​•third-party clinical investigators do not perform the clinical trials in accordance with the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices or other third-party organizations do not perform data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;​•enrollment and sample size of our clinical trials may be substantially different than estimated which may lead to longer timelines and larger expenses;​•third-party clinical investigators engage in activities that, even if not directly associated with our clinical trials, result in their debarment, loss of licensure, or other legal or regulatory sanction;​•regulatory inspections of manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend the clinical trials;​•changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions;​•the interim results of the clinical trial, if any, are inconclusive or negative; and​•the study design, although approved and completed, is inadequate to demonstrate effectiveness and safety.​Our dependence upon clinical trials in developing product candidates may impede them from reaching advanced stages of development, and might prevent all or part of our commercial operations.
If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, the commercial launch and sales of our potential products may be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed.We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.We are exposed to the risk of claims seeking monetary damages being filed against us for loss or harm suffered by participants of our clinical trials or for loss or harm suffered by users of any drug that may receive approval for commercialization in the future.
In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case;​•the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance;​•patent applications may not result in any patents being issued;​•patents that may be issued or in-licensed may be challenged, invalidated, modified, revoked, circumvented, narrowed, found to be unenforceable or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;​•our competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that will limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential product candidates;​•there may be significant pressure on the U.S. government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and​•countries other than the U.S. may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing product candidates.​Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.33TABLE OF CONTENTSIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.Our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection for the composition, use and structure of our products and product candidates, the methods used to manufacture them, the related therapeutic targets and associated methods of treatment as well as on successfully defending these patents against potential third-party challenges.
