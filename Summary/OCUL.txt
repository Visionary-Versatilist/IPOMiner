We expect to complete this trial in the fourth quarter of 2015 and then assess the future direction of the clinical development of this product candidate based on these results.Ocular inflammation and pain are common side effects following ophthalmic surgery.
The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:•Create proprietary solutions for ophthalmic diseases and conditions based on our bioresorbable hydrogel technology platform combined with FDA-approved therapeutic agents to improve the delivery of these agents.•Improve patient compliance and management of front-of-the-eye diseases and conditions by replacing standard of care eye drop therapies with our sustained release product candidates.•Rapidly complete clinical development of and seek marketing approval for our most advanced punctum plug product candidates for diseases and conditions of the front of the eye.•Apply our sustained release punctum plug technology for treatment of additional diseases and conditions of the front of the eye.•Maximize commercial potential of ReSure Sealant and any other products for which we receive marketing approval.•Pursue development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot and other technologies for back-of-the-eye diseases and conditions.Risks Associated with Our BusinessOur

Our expenses will increase if:•we are required by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, to perform trials or studies in addition to those currently expected;•there are any delays in receipt of regulatory clearance to begin our planned clinical programs; or•there are any delays in enrollment of patients in or completing our clinical trials or the development of our product candidates.ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales.
If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.We expect to devote substantial financial resources to our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we conduct late stage clinical
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the level of product sales from ReSure Sealant and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future;16Table of Contents•ReSure Sealant and any additional products for which we obtain marketing approval in the future;•the progress, costs and outcome of the clinical trials of our punctum plug product candidates, in particular OTX-DP and OTX-TP;•the scope, progress, costs and outcome of preclinical development and clinical trials of our other product candidates;•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities;•the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration, distribution or other marketing arrangements for our products and product candidates;•the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and•the extent to which we acquire or invest in other businesses, products and technologies.Conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete.

approval;•developing, validating and maintaining a commercially viable manufacturing process that is compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;•developing and expanding our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for ReSure Sealant and successfully launching commercial sales of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval;•developing and expanding our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•effectively competing with other therapies;•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval;•obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity; and•protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.If we do not achieve one or
marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, including our punctum plug product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and
interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.In general, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled clinical trials to support the effectiveness of a new drug for marketing
delays or additional costs in achieving our research, development and commercialization objectives, including in obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates and meeting customer demand for ReSure Sealant, which could materially damage
degree of market acceptance of ReSure Sealant or any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will depend on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;27Table of Contents•our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices, particularly in light of the lower cost of alternative treatments;•the clinical indications for which the product is approved;•the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments, including the plug retention rate for our punctum plug product candidates;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the strength of our marketing and distribution support;•timing of market introduction of competitive products;•the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement and, for ReSure Sealant, the lack of separate reimbursement when used as part of a cataract surgery procedure;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and•any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.For example,
pose a number of risks, including the following:•collaborators have significant discretion in determining the amount and timing of efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;•collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;•collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates that receive marketing approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on results
