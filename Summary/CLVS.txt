We currently generate no revenues from sales of any drugs, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug.Each of our product candidates will require additional clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining
regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions.9Table of ContentsClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and
subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;•obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;•recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;•developing and validating companion diagnostics on a timely basis;•having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;•adding new clinical trial sites; or•manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of
future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market CO-101, rucaparib and CO-1686, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more
effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;•regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;•we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and
contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical
targeting with such product candidate;•the safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;•the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;•relative convenience and ease of administration;•the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.16Table of ContentsIf our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance
managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:•the demand for any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;•our ability to set a price for our products;18Table of Contents•our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability;•the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and•the availability of capital.In addition, governments may impose price controls, which may adversely affect our future profitability.In some foreign countries, particularly in the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control.
If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive.

consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus, they may not be predictive of results or developments in future periods.Some of the factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated or predicted include:•the success and timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;•our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our product candidates, and the labeling under any approval we may obtain;•our plans to develop and commercialize our product candidates;•our ability, with partners, to validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval of companion diagnostics for our product candidates;•the loss of key scientific or management personnel;•the size and growth of the potential markets for our product candidates and our ability to serve those markets;•regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;•the rate and degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates;•our use of the proceeds from this offering;•the accuracy of our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing;•our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates;•the successful development of our sales and marketing capabilities;•the success of competing drugs that are or become available; and•the performance of third-party manufacturers.Any forward-looking statements that we make in this prospectus speak only as of the date of such statement, and we undertake no obligation to update such statements to reflect events or circumstances
