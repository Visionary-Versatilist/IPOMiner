We received $112.3 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, which we used to purchase newly-issued membership interests from SSE Holdings at a price per interest equal to the initial public offering price of our Class A common stock.In connection with the IPO, we completed the following transactions (the “Organizational Transactions”):▪We amended and restated the limited liability company agreement of SSE Holdings (“SSE Holdings LLC Agreement”) to, among other things, (i) provide for a new single class of common membership interests in SSE Holdings, the LLC Interests, (ii) exchange all of the membership interests of the Original SSE Equity Owners for LLC Interests and (iii) appoint Shake Shack as the sole managing member of SSE Holdings.▪We amended and restated our certificate of incorporation to, among other things, (i) provide for Class B common stock with voting rights but no economic interests(where “economic interests” means the right to receive any distributions or dividends, whether cash or stock, in connection with common stock)and (ii) issue shares of Class B common stock to the Original SSE Equity Owners on a one-to-one basis with the number of LLC Interests they own.▪We acquired, by merger, two entities that were owned by the Former SSE Equity Owners, for which we issued 5,968,841 shares of Class A common stock as merger consideration (the “Mergers”).
