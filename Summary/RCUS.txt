Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, rate of progress and costs of our drug discovery, preclinical development activities, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;•the number and scope of clinical programs we decide to pursue;•the scope and costs of manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;•the timing and amount of milestone payments, if any, we receive from Taiho Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.

Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to
products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;•regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;•we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market
The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;•our ability to offer our medicines for sale at competitive prices;•convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;23Table of Contents•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and•the prevalence and severity of any side effects.Risks Related to Manufacturing, Commercialization and
