development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside of our control, including:•the timing and amount of capital expenditures;•the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs, drilling equipment, support vessels, production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel;•the operator’s expertise and financial resources;•approval of other participants in drilling wells;•selection of technology; and•the rate of production of the reserves.13Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause
that are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:•acceptable prices for available properties;•amounts of recoverable reserves;•estimates of future oil and natural gas prices;•estimates of future exploratory, development and operating costs;•our estimates of the costs and timing of plug and abandonment; and•our estimates of potential environmental and other liabilities.Our assessment of the acquired properties will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the
In addition, our independent petroleum consultant may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, drilling results, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors,
In particular, these include, among other things, statements relating to:•amount, nature and timing of capital expenditures;•drilling of wells and other planned exploitation activities;•timing and amount of future production of oil and natural gas;•increases in proved reserves;•operating costs such as lease operating expenses, administrative costs and other expenses;•our future operating or financial results;•cash flow and anticipated liquidity;•our business strategy, including expansion into the deep shelf and the deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico, and the availability of acquisition opportunities;•exploration and exploitation activities and property acquisitions;•marketing of oil and natural gas; and•timing and amount of future dividends.Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this prospectus may turn out to be incorrect.
