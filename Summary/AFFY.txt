elsewhere in this prospectus, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.OverviewWe are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel peptide-based drug candidates to improve the treatment of serious and often life-threatening
regulatory milestone payments, reimbursement of third party U.S. clinical development expenses, product profit share revenues (as co-promotion revenues) and royalties.In February 2006, we issued an exclusive license to Takeda for the development and commercialization of Hematide in Japan.
U.S. We and Takeda will jointly decide on promotional responsibility for markets outside of these initial indications.Under the February 2006 agreement, Takeda also obtained a right of first negotiation to any backup products for Hematide developed by us or our third-party partners.
during the first ten years of the agreement, if we or our third-party partners develop a product that advances to Phase 2 clinical trials and competes with Hematide in the renal or oncology
single unit of accounting method discussed above.We have recognized $5.0 million of revenue under our Arrangement with Takeda during the nine months ended September 30, 2006.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses consist of: (i) license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property; (ii) expenses incurred
We will need to raise additional capital to support continued development of our product candidates thereafter.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, accounting, business and commercial
fair value of the common stock underlying stock options granted during this period was estimated by the board of directors with input from management based upon several factors,
Our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock at each option grant date, including the factors described below:•the
prevailing market conditions.In connection with the preparation of the financial statements necessary for the filing of our initial public offering, we have reassessed the fair value of our common stock at option
of an active market for our common stock, our board of directors determined the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors, including those described above.In July 2006, we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a retrospective analysis to determine the fair value of our common stock for accounting purposes as of
for the lead product candidates of the comparable companies chosen (using estimates from independent market research organizations), the level of risk associated with the clinical trials for Hematide,
from a baseline that a similar stage in clinical trials had a similar level of risk).We determined that the fair value of our common stock would not appreciate significantly during the period September 1, 2006 through the expected date of this initial public
principal reasons for the differences in the fair value of our common stock at these dates as compared to the estimated initial public offering price of $23.00 per share.February 2006:We retained an independent valuation firm to conduct a retrospective valuation as of this grant date, and they did so
The initial public offering price is 23.00 per share at these dates as a result of changes in the market for initial public offerings by biotechnology companies.Based on an estimated initial public offering price of $23.00 per share, the intrinsic value of the options outstanding at September 30, 2006 was $22.1 million of which
$20,000 in 2009.In addition, during September 2003, we approved the repricing of existing employee stock options from $4.00 to $0.80 per share, which was deemed to be the fair market value.
This model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that, at the date of grant, we make assumptions with respect to the expected term of the option, the volatility of the
month period ended September 30, 2006 includes a $2 million adjustment to correct the cumulative overstatement of stock-based compensation related charges.In addition, we will revise the previously reported first and second quarter 2006 financial statements when its 2007 quarterly financial statements are issued to reflect the impact
associated with the revised common stock values in the correct periods.Adoption of SFAS No. 123(R)Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),Share-Based
Payment,or SFAS No.123(R), which requires compensation costs related to share-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the
year period beginning with the month the intangible asset was acquired.Results of OperationsComparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 and 2006Nine Months Ended September 30Increase/(Decrease)% Increase/(Decrease)20052006(unaudited)(in thousands, except percentages)Revenue$67$4,991$4,9247,349%Research and Development Expenses(1)16,84941,22824,379145%General and Administrative Expenses(1)6,16311,3435,18084%Interest Income (Expense), Net7663,4772,711354%Other Income (Expense), Net35(22)(57)(163)%Accretion of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock to Redemption Value182624442243%(1) Includes the following stock-based compensation charges:Research and development expenses$1,065$1,195$13012%General and administrative expenses2,2663,7791,51367%Revenue.We recognized immaterial revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 from royalty payments.
