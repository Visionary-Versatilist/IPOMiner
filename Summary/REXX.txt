projects.Develop Our Existing Properties:Our focus is to develop our asset base in each of our operating basins including:•our Lawrence Field ASP Flood Project in Illinois;•our Marcellus Shale natural gas play with approximately 64,000 gross (36,000 net) acres;•our inventory of approximately 500 proved undeveloped locations and proved developed non-producing wells; and•our New Albany Shale resource play with over 306,000 gross (92,000 net) acres.Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Joint Ventures:We plan to continue to acquire and lease additional oil and natural gas properties in our
strategy, as well as activities on our properties, and could cause a decrease in the price of our common stock and result in a loss of a portion or all of your investment:•Our use of EOR methods in our ASP project or our use of horizontal drilling might not be not be effective at increased levels of production;•Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or

extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures.Enhanced Oil Recovery, or EOR, techniques that we may use, such as our Alkali-Surfactant-Polymer flooding in the Lawrence Field, involve more risk than traditional
commodity prices for oil and natural gas in 2008, we expect to report a significant non-cash unrealized loss from our oil and gas derivative arrangements for the quarter ended March 31, 2008, which will affect our results of operations and net
to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves.
These factors include:•changes in oil and natural gas prices;•variations in quarterly drilling, recompletions, acquisitions and operating results;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;•changes in market valuations of comparable companies;•additions or departures of key personnel;•future sales of our stock; or•other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus.We may fail to meet expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result.You may experience dilution of your ownership interests due to the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.We may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present
achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by us in those statements include, among others, the following:•the quality of our properties with regard to, among other things, the existence of reserves in economic quantities;•uncertainties about the estimates of reserves;•our ability to increase our production and oil and natural gas income through exploration and development;•our ability to successfully apply horizontal drilling techniques, shale completion methods and tertiary recovery methods (including our Lawrence Field ASP Flood
Project);•the number of well locations to be drilled, the cost to drill and the time frame within which they will be drilled;•the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas;•domestic demand for oil and natural gas;•drilling and operating risks;•the availability of equipment, such as drilling rigs and transportation pipelines;•changes in our drilling plans and related budgets;•the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional borrowing capacity; and•other factors discussed under “Risk Factors” in this prospectus.Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated are discussed in our periodic filings with the SEC, including
EBITDAX, as defined above, is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements, such as our commercial bank lenders, to analyze such things as:•Our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financial or capital structure;•The financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;•Our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders; and•The viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.Production Cost per BOEProduction costs are comprised of those expenses which are directly attributable to our producing oil and gas leases, including state and county production taxes, production related insurance, the cost of materials,
