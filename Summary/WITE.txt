Prior to December 1, 2014, the Trust utilized the Londonafternoon platinum fixand the London afternoon palladium fixas its benchmarksfor valuation purposes.The London afternoon fix for platinum and palladium( the “The London afternoon fix for platinum and palladium”)was the price of an ounce of platinum or palladium as set by four fixing members of the LPPM at approximately 2:00 PM, London time, on each working day and was widely accepted among platinum and palladium market participants.As of the close of business on November 30, 2014, theLPPFCLtransferred theownership of the historic and future intellectual property of the twice daily “fix” for platinum and palladiumto a subsidiary company of the LBMA and theadministration ofplatinum and palladiumprice fixing mechanisms to the LME, which now results in, for the purposes of the Trust, the LME PM Fix.The LME has not operated this fixing process previously and the LME PM Fixmay, among other things:•not behave over time like the London afternoon platinum fix and the London afternoon palladium fix have historically;•create a potential transitional Trust NAV or platinum or palladium price tracking deviation since the last London afternoon platinum fix or London afternoon palladium fix, as applicable, used by the Trust may not correspond exactly to the applicable LME PM Fix;•be based on procedures and subject to regulation and oversight significantly different than those applicable to the London afternoon platinum fix or the London afternoon palladium fix;•result in delays or errors in the determination of a daily benchmark price of platinum or palladium;•not be as widely accepted as the London afternoon platinum fix or the London afternoon palladium fix; or•otherwise prove unreliable.If theLME PM Fixis unreliable for any reason, the price ofplatinum or palladiumand the market price for the Shares may decline or be subject to greater volatility.If the process of creation and redemption of Baskets encounters any unanticipated difficulties, the possibility for arbitrage transactionsthe effect of which is tokeep the price of the Shares closely linked to the prices of the underlyingBullion, by allowing the market participants to profit from divergences,may not exist and, as a result, the price of the Shares may fall.If the processes of creation and redemption of Shares (which depend on timely transfers of Bullion to and by the Custodian) encounter any unanticipated difficulties, including, but not limited to, the Trust’s inability in the future to obtain regulatory approvals for the offer and sale of additional Shares after the present offering is completed, potential market participants who would otherwise be willing to purchase or redeem Baskets to take advantage of any arbitrage opportunity arising from discrepancies between the price of the Shares and the prices of the underlying Bullion may not take the risk that, as a result of those difficulties, they may not be able to realize the profit they expect.
The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the Bullion transfers in and out of the Trust’s unallocated and allocated Bullion accounts and identifying the silver bars and the platinum and palladium plates or ingots held in the Trust’s allocated Bullion account.The Custodian’s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor.The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell Bullion or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.Inspection of BullionUnder the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust’s Bullion and certain related records maintained by the Custodian.Under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed to procure similar inspection rights from the Zurich Sub-Custodian.
