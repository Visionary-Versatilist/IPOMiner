seeking to enter into collaborations to explore the potential clinical benefits of administering SB 9200 in combination with investigational agents with different mechanisms of action for the treatment of chronic HBV patients.•Develop additional SMNH candidates from our proprietary platform as antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents.We are developing next-generation analogs of SB 9200, including SB 9400, SB 9941 and SB 9946.
have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects; and•we may not be able to retain key executives or to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.It is difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development and subsequently obtaining regulatory approval.- 6 -Table of ContentsOur Corporate InformationWe were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as Spring Bank Technologies, Inc. on October 7, 2002.
We anticipate these losses to increase as our expenses increase, and we expect that our expenses will increase if and as we:•continue to develop and conduct clinical trials of SB 9200, including the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial of SB 9200 for chronic HBV that we initiated in the second quarter of 2016;•initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for our other product candidates;•seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;•seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;•establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain marketing approval, if any;•require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire and retain additional personnel, including clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company; and•add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs.- 10 -Table of ContentsWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become profitable.We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing and have not generated any revenue from product sales.
Our ability to generate revenue from product sales of SB 9200 or any other product candidate also depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:•successfully complete development activities, including enrollment of trial participants and completion of the necessary clinical trials;•complete and submit New Drug Applications, or NDAs, to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and obtain regulatory approvals from the FDA for SB 9200 and our other product candidates for indications
for which there is a commercial market;•complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities for SB 9200 and our other product candidates;•successfully commercialize any approved products;•manufacture or have manufactured commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;•develop a commercial organization capable of manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution for any products we intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize such products on our own;•enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture, market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets; and•obtain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payors.In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including those of SB 9200 or our other
long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:•initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of SB 9200, including our Phase 2a clinical trial in chronic HBV that we initiated in June 2016;- 12 -Table of Contents•initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our other product candidates;•our obligation to make royalty and non-royalty sublicense receipt payments to third-party licensors, if any, under our licensing agreements;•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we discover or in-license and develop;•the outcome, timing and cost of seeking regulatory review by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we
perform more studies than those that we currently expect;•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;•subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of SB 9200 and any other products;•the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities;•the costs and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval; and•the costs of operating as a public company.Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our
SB 9200 will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful initiation and completion of our ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial in HBV;•successful completion of additional preclinical studies to support additional clinical trials;•initiation and successful enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials;•safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;•timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;- 14 -Table of Contents•the performance of our future collaborators, if any;•the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;•establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers;•establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug products that are appropriately packaged for sale;•obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;•protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;•successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval;•a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;•commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors following any marketing approval; and•our ability to compete with other therapies, including therapies targeting viral hepatitis and other antiviral applications.Many of these factors are beyond our control, including clinical development, the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our
significantly among different CROs and trial sites;•delay or failure in obtaining Investigational Review Board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to conduct a clinical trial at a site;•withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;•delay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable study subjects to participate in a trial;•delay or failure in study subjects completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up or otherwise complying with the trial protocol;•clinical sites and investigators deviating from the trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or dropping out of a trial;•inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for competing product candidates with the same
any time for safety issues or for any other reason;•unacceptable risk-benefit profile, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects or adverse events;•failure of a product candidate to demonstrate any benefit;•difficulties in manufacturing or obtaining from third parties sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;•lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrollment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical studies or increased expenses associated with
acceptable cost, or we may experience interruptions in supply; and- 20 -Table of Contents•the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient to obtain marketing approval.Product development costs for us will increase if we experience delays in testing or pursuing marketing approvals and we may be required to
the:•efficacy and safety of our product candidates administered with other drugs each as demonstrated in clinical trials and post-marketing experience;•clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;•potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;•safety of our product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications should physicians choose to prescribe for such uses;- 21 -Table of Contents•prevalence and severity of any side effects;•product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;•timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as of competitive products;•cost of treatment with our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments;•availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;•adverse publicity about our product candidates or favorable publicity about competitive products;•the convenience and ease of administration of our product candidates as compared to alternative treatments;•effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and•changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product candidate.Moreover, if SB 9200 is approved but fails to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, or healthcare providers are restricted,
any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market, sell or distribute
manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.If we enter into licensing or collaboration agreements with third parties to develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize SB 9200 or any
authorities may not approve our product candidates, include:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;•we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;•the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;•we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;- 31 -Table of Contents•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;•the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and•the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.Any delay in obtaining or failure to obtain required approvals could negatively affect our ability or that of any future collaborators to
