In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this prospectus, including our financial statements and accompanying notes.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe are a company with limited sources of revenue, and we are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate Difimicin and, to a lesser degree, our other lead
product candidates will require extensive additional clinical study and evaluation, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before
our research and development programs to advance our product pipeline.We estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $40.1 million, based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $8.50 per share, the midpoint of the price range set
of the above events could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause our stock price to decline.11The clinical and commercial success of Difimicin depends on our ability to develop and commercialize in collaboration with Par, on our own or with one or more future partners
Difimicin or any adverse developments in any such relationships could materially harm our business and prospects.In January 2007, we entered into a prospective buy-back agreement with Par pursuant to which we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering
addition, a collaborator may shift its research, development, manufacturing and commercialization resources to other product opportunities including those that might be competitive with Difimicin.Par
for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.If we fail to gain and maintain approval from regulatory authorities in international markets for Difimicin and any future product candidates for which we have rights in
international markets, our market opportunities will be limited.Sales of our product candidates outside of the United States will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and marketing approval.
for our products, our ability to generate product revenues would be limited, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.If our product candidates are unable to compete effectively with branded and generic antibiotics, our commercial opportunity would be reduced or eliminated.If approved, our lead product candidates will compete against both branded antibiotic therapies, such as Vancocin Pulvules with respect to Difimicin and Xifaxan®
eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize generic or branded antibiotics that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our product candidates.We currently depend, and will in the future continue to depend, on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, including Difimicin and Prulifloxacin.
agreements with third-party manufacturers on acceptable terms, would cause shortages of clinical trial supplies of our product candidates, thereby delaying or preventing regulatory approval and/or
Prulifloxacin in these other markets from other companies even if these patients are from the United States.If we fail to develop and commercialize other products or product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business.A key element of our strategy is to commercialize a portfolio of new anti-infective products in addition to Difimicin and Prulifloxacin.
product candidate we identify may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including pre-clinical studies, extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable
attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.35We will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance
