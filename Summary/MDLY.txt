You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together with the other information contained in this prospectus, before investing in shares of our Class A common stock.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryDifficult market and political conditions may adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political conditions throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to our taxation, taxation of our investors, the possibility of changes to tax laws in either the United States or any non-U.S. jurisdiction and regulations on asset managers), trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts and security
value of our assets under management and in part on investment performance, if any of these factors cause a decline in our assets under management or result in non-performance of loans by investee companies, it would result in lower fees earned, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from funds managed pursuant to advisory agreements that may be terminated or fund partnership agreements that permit fund investors to remove us as the general partner.With respect to our permanent capital vehicles, each fund’s investment management agreement must be approved annually by such fund’s board of directors or by the vote of a majority of the stockholders and the majority of the independent members of such fund’s board of directors and, in certain cases, by its stockholders, as required by law.
Investments in private companies pose certain incremental risks as compared to investments in public companies including that private companies:•have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress;•may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under debt that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;•may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;•are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our investee company and, in turn, on us; and•generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position.
Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including:•a number of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do;•some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors’ funds or other available investment products;•several of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited;•some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our funds;•some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do and/or bear less compliance expense than we do;•some of our competitors may have more flexibility than we have in raising certain types of funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors;•some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do; and•other industry participants may, from time to time, seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us.In addition, the attractiveness of our funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions.
