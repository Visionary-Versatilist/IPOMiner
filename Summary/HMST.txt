Management does not have any reason to believe that the risk-based capital ratio will be increased in any subsequent enforcement order.We anticipate that a contribution of approximately $44.0 million of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering, together with the Bank’s preliminary January earnings and expected February
changes in the average assets and variations in the Bank’s net income that may affect our regulatory capital ratios, we may adjust the actual amount of the contribution up to the aggregate net proceeds.We have implemented a plan for the Bank to reduce those loans that were classified as “substandard” or “doubtful” as
These events would be recorded as charges against earnings, which would reduce our financial performance in the affected periods, and in some cases may require that we raise additional capital.We anticipate that a contribution of approximately $44.0 million of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering, together with the
new business customers, we offer money market and business savings accounts as well as a competitive array of cash management products and services.Our growth strategy will be limited by our regulatory status, which generally would preclude us from obtaining the required consent from the FDIC and the DFI in order to open new bank branches.
As a result, we believe we have a substantial opportunity to attract additional borrowers and depositors and expand our presence and market share, especially in the high-growth Puget Sound area.Single Family Mortgage Origination and Servicing Portfolio GrowthDuring the real estate boom of 2004 through 2007, we maintained our historical focus on originating conforming conventional and FHA and VA loans for sale in the secondary market while supplementing those
loan-to-value ratios and increased cash equity and debt service coverage requirements.Significant Sources of Noninterest IncomeOur noninterest income is substantially higher than traditional banks.•Highly Profitable Single Family Mortgage Origination and Servicing Business.

regulations, and orders the Bank to cease and desist from certain practices relating to poor management, inadequate board oversight, inadequate liquidity and capital for our assets, excessive poor quality loans, operating losses and failure to
make certain severance or indemnification payments and make any change in directors or senior executive officers without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.Pursuant to the Company Order, we have developed a plan to manage our liquidity, capital and risk profile, and to address our financial obligations, including interest payments on the TruPS, without
any adjustments that might result from the lack of success in implementing our plans or the occurrence of other events that could adversely affect its condition or operations.We may be subject to continuing enhanced supervision by our regulators even if the cease and desist orders are lifted or replaced.We anticipate that the Bank Order will be replaced following the successful completion of this offering, including the contribution of at
In particular, the economic slowdown in our markets has resulted in many of the following conditions, which have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on the Bank’s business:•an increase in loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures;•a decline in the demand for products and services, including a material reduction in the volume of our single family purchase loan transactions and
commercial real estate loan transactions;26Table of Contents•a decline in the value of loan collateral, especially real estate, which in turn may reduce customers’ borrowing power;•a decline in the demand for loans; and•a decline in the origination of loans, especially residential construction, income property and business banking loans.Each of these conditions has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including but not limited to a decrease
a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of financial institutions whose loan portfolios are more diversified.Continued or worsening conditions in the real estate market and higher than normal delinquency and default rates on loans could cause other adverse consequences for us, including:•the reduction of cash flows and capital resources, as we are required to make cash advances to meet contractual obligations to investors, process
customers changes materially or if our allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, including our liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
