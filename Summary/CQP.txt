be borne by our unitholders and our general partner.•You may be required to pay taxes on your share of our taxable income even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us.•Tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected.Formation Transactions and Partnership StructureGeneralWe are a Delaware limited partnership formed in November 2006.
