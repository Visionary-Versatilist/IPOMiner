We believe key attributes of our LADD technology platform include:•Early Evidence of Efficacy.Our randomized controlled Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who had received or refused prior therapy demonstrated improved overall survival.•Novel Mechanism.Our LADD product candidates are designed to initiate a powerful innate immune response and drive a targeted, durable adaptive immune response.•Early Evidence of Safety in Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials.Through our proprietary deletion of two genes that contribute toListeria’s virulence, we substantially reduce the natural
We expect to complete enrollment in the third quarter of 2015 and to report top line results in the first half of 2016.•Maximize the commercial value of our proprietary LADD and CDN technology platforms.We currently have global development, marketing and commercialization rights for our lead product candidate, CRS-207, as well as
financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts.•Our business is highly dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, CRS-207, and GVAX Pancreas.
in significant negative consequences.•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.•We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.•We are subject to a complicated regulatory regime subject to change and may fail to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.5Table of ContentsConcurrent Private PlacementNovartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc., or NIBR, an existing stockholder and an affiliate of Novartis, a collaboration partner, has

Because the design and outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.12Table of ContentsOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates if clinical trials are successful;•the cost of commercialization activities for our product candidates, if any of our product candidates is approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for commercialization;•our ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and•the emergence of competing cancer therapies and other adverse market developments.We do not
Advancing these novel immuno-oncology therapies creates significant challenges for us, including, among others:•obtaining approval from regulatory authorities to conduct clinical trials with our product candidates;•successful enrollment and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials with favorable results;•obtaining approvals from regulatory authorities to manufacture and market our product candidates;•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;•making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, commercial manufacturing capabilities;•manufacturing our product candidates at an acceptable cost;•launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with Janssen, Novartis or other partners;•acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•effectively competing with other cancer therapies;•obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for our product candidates;•protecting rights in our intellectual property portfolio;•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates, if approved, following approval; and•maintaining and growing an organization of scientists and business people who can develop and commercialize our products and technology.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to
commercialize CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas effectively will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial or other clinical trials, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;•successful achievement of the objectives of the our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial, including the demonstration of a survival benefit and a favorable risk-benefit outcome;•receipt of marketing approvals for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;•establishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;•establishing a commercial infrastructure;•acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•establishing market share while competing with other therapies;•successfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;•a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product following regulatory approval; and•qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product.All of our product candidates, including CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas, will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory
prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential, if approved, or result in significant negative consequences.Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials
market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely
If any third-party provider fails to maintain proper temperature control or if a shipment is delayed in transit for a prolonged period of time, the product could become unsuitable for use.Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product candidates and/or damage that occurs during shipping may result in
candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:•differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;•difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;•challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.22Table of ContentsThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely
