Because the design and outcome of our planned and anticipated clinical trials is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.12Table of ContentsOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials;•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates if clinical trials are successful;•the cost of commercialization activities for our product candidates, if any of our product candidates is approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;•the cost of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials in preparation for regulatory approval and in preparation for commercialization;•our ability to establish and maintain strategic licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, expanding, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation;•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any; and•the emergence of competing cancer therapies and other adverse market developments.We do not
Advancing these novel immuno-oncology therapies creates significant challenges for us, including, among others:•obtaining approval from regulatory authorities to conduct clinical trials with our product candidates;•successful enrollment and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials with favorable results;•obtaining approvals from regulatory authorities to manufacture and market our product candidates;•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;•making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, commercial manufacturing capabilities;•manufacturing our product candidates at an acceptable cost;•launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with Janssen, Novartis or other partners;•acceptance of our product candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•effectively competing with other cancer therapies;•obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for our product candidates;•protecting rights in our intellectual property portfolio;•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates, if approved, following approval; and•maintaining and growing an organization of scientists and business people who can develop and commercialize our products and technology.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to

commercialize CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas effectively will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial or other clinical trials, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party contractors;•successful achievement of the objectives of the our Phase 2b ECLIPSE clinical trial, including the demonstration of a survival benefit and a favorable risk-benefit outcome;•receipt of marketing approvals for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;•establishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;•establishing a commercial infrastructure;•acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•establishing market share while competing with other therapies;•successfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;•a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product following regulatory approval; and•qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product.All of our product candidates, including CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas, will require additional clinical and non-clinical development, regulatory
market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely
including:•the patient eligibility criteria defined in the protocol;•the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial’s primary endpoints;•the proximity of patients to study sites;•the design of the trial;•our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;•clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the
Because our product candidates are based on new technologies and engineered on a patient-by-patient basis, we expect that they will require extensive research and development and have substantial manufacturing and processing costs.
because the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications, including to be used as first or second line therapy.We have obtained orphan drug designations from the FDA for CRS-207 and GVAX Pancreas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and for CRS-207 for the
If any third-party provider fails to maintain proper temperature control or if a shipment is delayed in transit for a prolonged period of time, the product could become unsuitable for use.Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product candidates and/or damage that occurs during shipping may result in
candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:•differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;•difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;•challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.22Table of ContentsThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely
Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:•identifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;•managing our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical and FDA review process for our product candidates, while complying with our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties;
Additional factors will influence whether our product candidates are accepted in the market, including:•the clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;•physicians, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and patients considering our product candidates as a safe and effective treatment;•the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;•limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA;•the timing of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products;•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;•the availability of adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by third-party payors and government authorities;•the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage by third-party payors and government authorities;•relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies; and•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.In addition, we are utilizing
Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:•decreased demand for our product candidates;•injury to our reputation;•withdrawal of clinical trial participants;•initiation of investigations by regulators;•costs to defend the related litigation;•a diversion of management’s time and our resources;•substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;•product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;•loss of revenue;•exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;•the inability to commercialize any product candidate; and•a decline in our share price.Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance
adequate should any claim arise.Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third PartiesWe have entered into licensing agreements with third parties for certain product candidates and as a result have placed restrictions on our development
commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.If our third-party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for
efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Government RegulationThe FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory
obtained.Our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;•we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;•the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;•we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;•the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;32Table of Contents•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; or•the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.This lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory
may adversely affect:•the demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval;•our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;•our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;•the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and•the availability of capital.Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government
