We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:•conduct and complete our ongoing and planned clinical trials;•initiate clinical trials of suprachoroidal axitinib for the treatment of wet AMD;•seek to discover, research and develop additional product candidates;•seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;•ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any drugs for which we
may obtain regulatory approval;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire additional clinical, manufacturing and scientific personnel;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development and planned future
unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates
We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete later-stage clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing
The success of those product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of preclinical studies and requisite clinical trials;•performing preclinical studies and clinical trials in compliance with FDA requirements;•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•ability to import sufficient quantity of product for trials or potential commercialization;•obtaining marketing approvals with labeling for sufficiently broad patient populations and indications, without unduly restrictive distribution limitations or
safety warnings, such as black box warnings or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, program;•obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;•making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing, commercial manufacturing capabilities;•launching commercial sales of products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•successful training of physicians in the proper use of our SCS Microinjector;•our ability to market our products for use with our SCS Microinjector without a requirement from the FDA that we obtain a separate medical device authorization;•acceptance of the therapies and of the concept of suprachoroidal injection of drugs, if and when approved, by physicians, patients and third-party payors;20Table of Contents•competing effectively with other therapies;•obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;•protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; and•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the drugs and our SCS Microinjector following approval.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize
suprachoroidal injection, to date no other company has explored this specific concomitant treatment approach in clinical trials or preclinical studies.Even if we are able to successfully develop, and achieve marketing approval of, Zuprata for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO, it may be difficult
upon our approach, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which could significantly harm our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome.
Patient enrollment is affected by other factors including:•the severity of the disease under investigation;•the eligibility criteria for the study in question;•the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;•the availability of drugs approved to treat the diseases under study;•the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;•the patient referral practices of physicians;•the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and•the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether.
acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.We also expect to rely on third-party manufacturers or collaborators for the manufacture of commercial supply of any other product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.
Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product
The29Table of Contentsdegree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;•our ability to offer our drugs for sale at competitive prices;•the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the willingness of the healthcare community and patients to adopt new technologies and our novel approach of suprachoroidal injection of drugs;•the willingness of retinal specialists to expend the time necessary to receive proper training on injecting drugs into the SCS using our SCS Microinjector;•the ability to manufacture our product in sufficient quantities and yields;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects; and•any restrictions on the use of our drugs together with other medications.We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.The development and commercialization of new products is highly competitive.
