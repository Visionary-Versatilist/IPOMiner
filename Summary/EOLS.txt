Any failure or refusal by Daewoong to supply DWP-450 or by any future manufacturer to supply any other product candidates or products that we may develop could delay, prevent or impair our clinical development or commercialization efforts.•We may require additional financing to fund our future operations, and a failure to obtain additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our operations.We have historically funded our operations through the support of our parent company, ALPHAEON Corporation, or ALPHAEON, from which funding may not be available after the completion of this offering.•As of September 30, 2017, we have concluded that we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations through November 2018, a year from the date our financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were issued, without additional financing, and as a result, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.•Even if DWP-450 or future product candidates, if any, receive regulatory approval, they may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician adoption and use necessary for commercial success.The commercial success of DWP-450 and any of our future product candidates, if approved, will depend significantly on the broad adoption and use of the resulting product by physicians for approved3Table of Contentsindications, including, in the case of DWP-450, the treatment of glabellar lines.•Even if DWP-450 is approved for commercialization, if there is not sufficient patient demand for DWP-450, our financial results and future prospects will be harmed.In addition, we have not pursued regulatory approval of DWP-450 for indications other than for the treatment of glabellar lines, which may also limit adoption of DWP-450, and if we are unable to obtain approval for indications in addition to our anticipated approval for glabellar lines, our marketing efforts for DWP-450 will be limited.•We will face significant competition in the aesthetic neurotoxin and broader self-pay healthcare market and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration and expansion.Many of our potential competitors are large, experienced companies that enjoy significant competitive advantages, such as substantially greater financial, research and development, manufacturing, personnel and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.•If we are unable toestablishsales and marketing capabilities on our own or through third parties, we will be unable to successfully commercialize DWP-450 or any other future product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.•If we or any of our current or future licensors,includingDaewoong, are unable to maintain, obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to DWP-450 or any of our future product candidates,we may notbe able to compete effectively in our market.•ALPHAEON controls the direction of our business, and the concentrated ownership of our common stock and certain contractual rights of ALPHAEON may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.In addition, we may take actions that stockholders other than ALPHAEON do not view as beneficial.
The regulatory and commercial success of DWP-450 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:•whether we are required by the FDA, EMA or other similar regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials to support the approval of DWP-450;•our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of DWP-450, if approved;•the prevalence, duration and severity of potential side effects experienced with DWP-450;•the timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA, EMA and other similar regulatory authorities;•achieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to DWP-450;•the ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms, or at all, if needed, to support the commercial launch of DWP-450;•the acceptance by physicians and patients of the safety and efficacy of DWP-450, if approved;•our ability to successfully commercialize DWP-450, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•the ability of our current manufacturer and any third parties with whom we may contract to manufacture DWP-450 to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP requirements; and•the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of competing products.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize DWP-450.
We may need to raise additional capital following the completion of this offering to fund our operations and continue to support both our near and long-term expenditures.Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for DWP-450 or any future product candidates;•the cost of commercialization activities if DWP-450 or any future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing any future product candidates, and conducting preclinical and clinical trials;•costs under our third-party manufacturing and supply arrangements for our current and any future product candidates and any products we commercialize;•our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the terms of and timing of such arrangements;•the degree and rate of market acceptance of DWP-450 or any future approved products;•the emergence, approval, availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing products;•costs of operating as a public company; and•costs associated with any acquisition or in-license of products and product candidates, technologies or businesses.If we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.
However, the ease of integration of DWP-450 into a physician’s practice may not be as seamless as we anticipate.If DWP-450 or any future product candidates are approved for use but fail to achieve the broad degree of physician adoption necessary for commercial success, our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.Even if DWP-450 is approved for commercialization, if there is not sufficient patient demand for DWP-450, our financial results and future prospects will be harmed.Treatment of glabellar lines with DWP-450 is an elective procedure, the cost of which must be borne by the patient, and we do not expect costs related to the treatment to be reimbursable through any third-party payor, such as Medicaid, Medicare or commercial insurance.
The decision by a patient to elect to undergo treatment with DWP-450 for the treatment of glabellar lines or other aesthetic indications that we may pursue may be influenced by a number of factors, including:•the success of any sales and marketing programs that we, or any third parties we engage, undertake, and as to which we have limited experience and are still in the process of planning and developing;•the extent to which physicians recommend DWP-450 to their patients;20Table of Contents•the extent to which DWP-450 satisfies patient expectationsand overcoming patient loyalty with existing products and brands;•our ability to properly train physicians in the use of DWP-450 such that their patients do not experience excessive discomfort during treatment or adverse side effects;•the cost, safety and effectiveness of DWP-450 versus other aesthetic treatments;•the developmentandavailability of alternative products and treatments that seek to address similar goals;•consumer sentiment about the benefits and risks of aesthetic procedures generally and DWP-450 in particular;•the success of any direct-to-consumer marketing efforts that we may initiate;•the ability and ease with which physicians are able to incorporate DWP-450 into their practices;•changes in demographic and social trends; and•general consumerconfidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions.It is expected that upon U.S. approval, DWP-450 will be the only U.S. neurotoxin without a therapeutic indication, although other companies may seek to develop a similar product in the future.
Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.25Table of ContentsAdditionally, if we or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by DWP-450, or any of our future product candidates, after obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or other jurisdictions, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;•regulatory authorities may require a recall of the product or we may voluntarily recall a product;•regulatory authorities may require the addition of warnings or contraindications in the product labeling, narrowing of the indication in the product label or issuance of field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;•regulatory authorities may require us to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients or institute aRisk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, orREMS;•we may be subject to limitations as to how we promote the product;•we may be required to change the way the product is administered or modify the product in some other way;•regulatory authorities may require additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product;•sales of the product may decrease significantly;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our brandandreputation may suffer.Any of the above events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products.
