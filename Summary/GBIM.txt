proceeds of this financing to advance our product candidates and increase our working capital.Expected MilestonesWe expect that the following milestones will occur:•Potential milestone payments from Gilead, if Gilead proceeds with a Phase 2b or Phase 3 clinical study of GS-4774;•One or more IND filings for infectious disease Tarmogens;•Celgene option decision point data from the GI-6207 Phase 2 trial for MTC;•Complete enrollment and data from GI-6301 Phase 1 trial by the first half of 2014 (results from Phase 1 trial may support initiation of Phase 2 program); and•Phase 2 development of GI-4000 in pancreas cancer and NSCLC, subject to entering into a collaboration or receiving additional funding other than this transaction.5Table of ContentsOur RisksAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.
results of operations and business condition are the following:•We have not completed clinical development of any of our product candidates and do not have any products approved for sale by the United States Federal Drug Administration, or FDA, or any other regulatory bodies.
We expect to continue to incur increasing net losses for the foreseeable future, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.•We, or our collaborators, may face delays in completing our clinical trials, and we may not be able to complete them at all.•Results of earlier studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future trial results.•Our Tarmogen product candidates are based on a novel technology, which may raise development issues we may not be able to resolve, regulatory issues that could delay or prevent approval, or personnel issues that may
or build acceptable facilities.•We rely on relationships with third-party contract manufacturers, which limits our ability to control the availability of, and manufacturing costs for, our product candidates.•If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.•Other factors identified elsewhere in this prospectus, including those set forth under “Risk Factors”.6Table of ContentsCorporate InformationWe were incorporated as Ceres Pharmaceuticals, Ltd. in Colorado on February 10, 1995.

continue to generate significant losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to complete our clinical trial programs for our product candidates, build commercial capabilities, develop our pipeline and expand our corporate infrastructure.
Our failure to obtain adequate financing when needed and on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.14Table of ContentsBUSINESS RISKSRisks Relating to Clinical Development and Commercialization of Our Product CandidatesIf we, or our collaborators, Celgene Corporation and Gilead Sciences, Inc., fail to successfully complete clinical trials, fail to obtain regulatory
Our, or our collaborators’, current and future clinical trials may be delayed, unsuccessful, or terminated as a result of many factors, including:•delays in designing an appropriate clinical trial protocol and reaching agreement on trial design with investigators and regulatory authorities;•governmental or regulatory delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or changes in regulatory requirements, policy or guidelines;•delays in establishing necessary clinical trial sites or the need to establish new clinical trial sites;•reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among
these factors, our trials may be delayed, unsuccessful or terminated because:•regulators or institutional review boards, or IRBs, may not authorize us to commence or continue a clinical trial;•regulators or IRBs may suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or concerns about patient safety;•we may suspend or terminate our clinical trials if we believe that they expose the participating patients to unacceptable health risks;•patients may not complete clinical trials due to safety issues, side effects, such as injection site discomfort, a belief that they are receiving placebo instead of our product candidates, the length of follow-up
periods, or other reasons;•patients with serious diseases included in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse medical events for reasons that may not be related to our product candidates;•in those trials where our product candidate is being tested in combination with one or more other therapies, deaths may occur that may be attributable to the other therapies;•we may have difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after administration of our Tarmogen product candidates, preventing us from collecting the data required by our study protocol;•product candidates may demonstrate a lack of efficacy during clinical trials;•diagnostic tests we or our collaborators develop, such as the BDX-001 diagnostic for a potential future GI-4000 clinical trial in pancreas cancer patients, may not effectively identify patients that respond to our
Patient enrollment is affected by factors including:•severity of the disease under investigation;•design of the trial protocol;•the size and nature of the patient population;•eligibility criteria for the study in question;•lack of a sufficient number of patients who meet the enrollment criteria for our clinical trials;•delays required to characterize tumor types to allow us to select the proper product candidate, which may lead patients to seek to enroll in other clinical trials or seek alternative treatments;•perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;•availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;•efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;•scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians;•patient referral practices of physicians;•the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after administration of our Tarmogen product candidates;•diagnostic tests we or our collaborators develop may not effectively identify patients that respond to our product candidates; and•proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.We have
conduct additional studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant
marketing approval for many reasons, including:•a product candidate may not be considered safe or effective;•our manufacturing processes or facilities may not meet the applicable requirements;•changes in the agencies’ approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional work on our part, for example, the FDA may require us to submit a separate BLA for each product version of GI-4000;•different divisions of the FDA are reviewing different product candidates and those divisions may have different requirements for approval; and•changes in regulatory law, FDA or foreign regulatory agency organization, or personnel may result in different requirements for approval than anticipated.Our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their endpoints in clinical trials.
regulatory approval of our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business and lead to a decline in the trading price of our securities.We do not control the conduct of certain clinical trials conducted by our collaborators, Gilead and Celgene.We have exclusively licensed two of our Tarmogen product candidates to collaborators for further clinical development and commercialization.
