The key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal include:•Rapidly advance our TORC1 program as immunotherapy for reducing the incidence of RTIs in elderly subjects;•Develop our TORC1 program for additional indications;•Commercialize our product candidates in the United States and potentially collaborate with others globally to maximize their commercial value;•Maintain and grow a robust intellectual property portfolio in the field of TORC1 inhibition for aging-related diseases; and•Develop, acquire orin-licenseproduct candidates that enhance our global leadership position.Risks Associated with Our BusinessOur
negative consequences following regulatory approval, if any;•We may be subject to additional risks because we are administering RTB101 in combination with other mTOR inhibitors, such as everolimus;•If we fail to develop RTB101 alone or in combination with an mTOR inhibitor for additional therapies or develop other product candidates, we may be unable to grow our business;•Use of third parties to manufacture our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or products, or necessary quantities at an acceptable cost;•Our commercial success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology;•We depend heavily on our executive officers and principal consultants and the loss of their services could materially harm our business; and•Concentration of ownership of our common stock may prevent new investors in this offering from influencing significant corporate decisions.Our Corporate InformationWe were
expenses will increase substantially if and as we:•continue to develop and conduct clinical trials for our lead product candidate, RTB101, alone and in combination with everolimus;•initiate and continue research, preclinical and clinical development efforts for any current or future product candidates;•seek to identify additional product candidates;•seek regulatory approvals for RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, or any other product candidates that successfully complete clinical development, if any;•establish sales, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, supply chain and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any;11Table of Contents•require the manufacture of larger quantities of RTB101 alone or in fixed dose combination with everolimus for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control, scientific and commercial personnel;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and help us comply with our obligations as a public company;•add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development; and•acquire orin-licenseother product candidates and technologies.Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue.
Our future funding requirements, both short- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for, RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, and any future product candidates;•our ability to enter into, and the terms and timing of, any collaborations, licensing or other arrangements on favorable terms, if at all;•the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;•the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;•if approved, the costs of commercialization activities for RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, or any other product candidate that receives regulatory approval to the extent such costs are not the
responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;•subject to receipt of regulatory approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, or any future product candidates;•the extent to which wein-licenseor acquire rights to other products, product candidates or technologies;•our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure;•the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property
clinical trials, or if patients choose to participate in the trials of other sponsors’ product candidates;•patients in our clinical trials may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to RTB101, which could delay or prevent further clinical development;•the requirements implemented by regulatory agencies may change at any time;16Table of Contents•the FDA, EMA or foreign regulatory agencies may require efficacy endpoints for a future clinical trial for reducing the incidence of RTIs that differ from the endpoints of our current or future trials, which may require
us to conduct additional clinical trials;•the mechanism of action of RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, is complex and we cannot guarantee the degree to which it will translate into a medical benefit in any indications;•competitor products including generic products may be developed to reduce the incidence of RTIs that may have similar or better safety and efficacy or lower costs than RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus;•we may not be able to establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain regulatory approval;•we or our contract manufacturers may not be able to manufacture RTB101, everolimus, the fixed dose combination of RTB101 with everolimus or other future product candidates at the appropriate quality or sufficient
quantities to support further clinical development and/or commercialization;•our investigational drug products or manufacturing processes may be considered by regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or EMA, to be unsuitable for continued development and/or commercialization;•we may observe unexpected toxicities in preclinical safety or efficacy animal studies that delay, limit or prevent further clinical development;•our intellectual property may not be patentable, valid or enforceable; and•we may not be able to obtain, maintain, defend, protect or enforce our patents, our trade secrets, regulatory exclusivities and other intellectual property rights, both in the United States and internationally,
control, including the risks related to clinical development, the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing and sales efforts of any future collaborator.
noncompliance with regulatory requirements;•the cost of clinical trials of RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, or any other potential product candidate may be greater than we anticipate;•regulators, institutional review boards or other reviewing bodies may fail to approve or subsequently find fault with the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we enter into
Further, research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render our product candidates obsolete even before they begin to generate any revenue.In addition, our competitors may obtain patent protection, regulatory exclusivities, or FDA approval and commercialize products more rapidly
failure to successfully initiate and complete clinical trials of RTB101, alone or in combination with everolimus, or any other product candidate and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market RTB101,
following adverse consequences could occur:•regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product, seize the product, or seek an injunction against its manufacture or distribution;•we, or any future collaborators, may need to recall the product, or be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials, develop a surveillance program;•additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of, or the manufacturing processes for, the particular product;•regulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies;•we may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;•regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a “black box” warning or a contraindication, or issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other
product candidates for clinical development for many reasons, including the following:•the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential product candidates;•competitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete;•product candidates that we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;•a product candidate may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria;•a product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and•a product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payors.If we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional product candidates, our potential for growth and achieving our strategic
The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy and safety of the product;•the potential advantages of the product compared to competitive therapies;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•whether the product is recommended under physician prophylactic guidelines;•whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-, second- or third-line therapy;•our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;•the product’s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;•limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions contained in the product’s approved labeling;•the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;•changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product; and•availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors.Any failure by RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus or any other product candidate of ours that obtains regulatory approval to
