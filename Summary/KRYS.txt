These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:•We have never generated revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.•Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.•We have a limited operating history and are very early in our development efforts.•Our lead product candidate, KB103, is still in preclinical development.•We may be unable to advance any of our product candidates to clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our product candidates.•We have not tested any of our product candidates in clinical trials, and success in early preclinical studies or clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained in later preclinical studies and clinical

authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of KB103, our expenses could increase and revenue could be further delayed.Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.As described in their audit report, our auditors have included an explanatory paragraph that states that we have incurred recurring losses and
commercialize any such approved products.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the progress and results of our planned clinical trials of KB103;•the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, laboratory testing, manufacturing, preclinical development and clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may pursue in the future, if any;•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of KB103 and any other product candidates we may develop;13Table of Contents•the costs of establishing and maintaining our own commercial-scale cGMP manufacturing facility;•the costs associated with the manufacturing process development and evaluation of third-party manufacturers;•the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, in the event we receive marketing approval for KB103 or any other product candidates we may develop;•the extent to which the costs of our product candidates, if approved, will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or will be reimbursed by
government authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors;•revenue, if any, received from commercial sale of KB103 or other product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;•our current license agreements remaining in effect and our achievement of milestones under those agreements;•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations and licenses on favorable terms, if at all; and•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain

The degree of market acceptance of gene therapy products and, in particular, KB103, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on several factors, including:•the efficacy and safety of KB103 as demonstrated in clinical trials;•the efficacy, potential and perceived advantages of KB103 over alternative treatments;•the cost of KB103 relative to alternative treatments;•the clinical indications for which KB103 is approved by the FDA or the European Commission;•patient awareness of, and willingness to seek, genotyping;•the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;•relative convenience and ease of administration;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the timing of market introduction of competitive products;•the availability of products and their ability to meet market demand;•publicity concerning our product candidates or competing products and treatments;•any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications; and•favorable third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement.Even if a potential product
