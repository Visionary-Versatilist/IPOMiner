proceeds from any exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units from us will be retained by us for general partnership purposes.Cash distributionsWe intend to make a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2125 per unit to the extent we have sufficient cash at the end of each quarter after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees
distribution rights to our general partner and 20,217,112 common units and 35,217,112 subordinated units to Phillips 66; and•the application of the net proceeds of this offering as described in “Use of Proceeds.”The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not give effect to an estimated $4.2 million in incremental general and administrative expenses
principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the volume of crude oil and refined petroleum products we transport;•the tariff rates with respect to volumes that we transport; and•changes in revenue we realize under the loss allowance provisions of our regulated tariffs resulting from changes in underlying commodity prices.In addition, the actual amount of distributable cash flow we generate will also depend on other factors, some of which are
deficiency payments in future periods;•the level of capital expenditures we make;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;21Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt service requirements;•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner;•changes in commodity prices; and•other business risks affecting our cash levels.The assumptions underlying the forecast of distributable cash flow that we include in “Cash Distribution Policy and Restrictions on Distributions” are inherently uncertain and subject to

other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may reduce the amount of cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders.31Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur partnership agreement replaces our general partner’s fiduciary duties to holders of our
The sale of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop.Our general partner’s discretion in establishing cash reserves may reduce the amount of cash we have available to distribute to unitholders.Our partnership agreement requires our general partner to deduct from operating surplus the cash reserves that it determines are necessary to fund our
