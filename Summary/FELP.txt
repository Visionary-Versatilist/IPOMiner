principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the amount of coal we are able to produce from our properties, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties and unfavorable geologic conditions;•the market price of coal;•the level of our operating costs, including reimbursement of expenses to our general partner;•the supply of and demand for domestic and foreign coal;•the timing of shipment of our contractual coal sales some of which are based on annual, not quarterly, minimum purchases;•the impact of delays in the receipt of, failure to maintain, or revocation of, necessary governmental permits;•the price and availability of other fuels;•the impact of existing and future environmental and climate change regulations, including those impacting coal-fired power plants;•the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest customers;•the cost of compliance with new environmental laws;•the cost of power needed to run our mines;-22-Table of Contents•worker stoppages or other labor difficulties;•cancellation or renegotiation of contracts;•prevailing economic and market conditions;•difficulties in collecting our receivables because of credit or financial problems of customers;•the effects of new or expanded health and safety regulations;•air emission, wastewater discharge and other environmental standards for coal-fired power plants or coal mines and technologies developed to help meet these standards;•domestic and foreign governmental regulation, including changes in governmental regulation of the mining industry or the electric utility industry;•the proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;•the availability of transportation infrastructure, including flooding and railroad derailments;•competition from other coal suppliers;•advances in power technologies;•the efficiency of our mines;•the pricing terms contained in our long-term contracts;•cancellation or renegotiation of contracts;•legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, including those related to the release of GHGs;•delays in the receipt of, or failure to receive, or revocation of necessary government permits;•inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters, such as heavy rain, high winds and flooding;•transportation costs;•the cost and availability of our contract miners;•the availability of skilled employees;•changes in tax laws; and•force majeure events.In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for
distribution will depend on several other factors, including:•the level and timing of capital expenditures we make;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party;•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner; and•the cost of acquisitions.For a description of additional restrictions and factors that may
during periods when we report net losses for financial accounting purposes and may not pay cash distributions during periods when we report net income.We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.At March 31, 2014, our total long-term indebtedness (excluding our sale-leaseback financing obligations) was approximately $1,560.8 million,
Our margins reflect the price we receive for our coal over our cost of producing and transporting our coal and are impacted by many factors, including:•The market price for coal;•the amount of coal we are able to produce from our properties, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties and unfavorable geologic conditions;•The supply of, and demand for, domestic and foreign coal;•Competition from other coal suppliers;•Advances in power technologies;•The efficiency of our mines;•The pricing terms contained in our long-term contracts;•Cancellation or renegotiation of contracts;•Legislative, regulatory and judicial developments, including those related to the release of GHGs;•The cost of using, and the availability of, other fuels, including the effects of technological developments;-26-Table of Contents•Air emission, wastewater discharge and other environmental standards for coal-fired power plants and technologies developed to help meet these standards;•Delays in the receipt of, or failure to receive, or revocation of necessary government permits;•Inclement or hazardous weather conditions and natural disasters, such as heavy rain, high winds and flooding;•The availability and cost or interruption of fuel, equipment and other supplies;•Transportation costs;•The availability of transportation infrastructure, including flooding and railroad derailments;•The cost and availability of our contract miners;•The availability of skilled employees; and•Work stoppages or other labor difficulties.Substantial or extended declines in the price
and ship coal and materially and adversely affect our results of operations, business and financial condition and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.We face numerous uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal reserves.Coal is economically recoverable when the price at which coal can be sold exceeds the costs and expenses of mining and selling the coal.
These factors and assumptions include:•Geologic and mining conditions, which may not be fully identified by available exploration data and may differ from our experience in areas we currently mine;•Future coal prices, operating costs and capital expenditures;•Severance and excise taxes, royalties and development and reclamation costs;•Future mining technology improvements;•The effects of regulation by governmental agencies;•Ability to obtain, maintain and renew all required permits;•Employee health and safety needs; and•Historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas.As a
generation industry could adversely affect the price of coal, which could negatively affect our results of operations, business and financial condition, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.-29-Table of ContentsCertain of our customers may seek to defer contracted shipments of coal, which could affect

terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current contracts, our results of operations, business and financial condition, as well as our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders may be materially adversely affected.Our operations are subject to risks, some of which are not insurable, and we cannot assure you that our existing insurance would be
