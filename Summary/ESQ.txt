As an emerging growth company:•we may present as few as two years of audited financial statements and two years of related management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations;​•we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;​•we are permitted to provide reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means we do not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosures regarding our executive compensation; and​•we are not required to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.​In addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies.
We also believe that the scalable platforms created by these investments position us for substantial growth in our key product lines and have laid the groundwork for our ability to operate as a larger financial institution.Diversified and Stable Business Model.The combination of our higher margin legal community focus for commercial banking (commercial loans, claimant/consumer loans and core low cost deposits), fee-based small business focus in merchant services and our community banking focus in the New York metropolitan area (commercial real estate and residential income producing lending) allows us to grow in varied economic conditions and business cycles.
However, substantially all of our real estate loans and a majority of our Attorney-Related Loans are concentrated in the New York metropolitan area and if negative economic conditions develop in the United States as a whole or in the New York market, we could experience higher delinquencies and loan charge-offs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition.Focused Risk Mitigation Practices.We have developed underwriting and credit management processes tailored to each of the products we offer, allowing us to construct a diversified asset portfolio including specialized markets not typically served by community banks.
Some of the more significant risks include the following:•We have a limited operating history and have recently experienced significant growth, which makes it difficult to forecast our revenue and evaluate our business and future prospects;​•Because we intend to continue to increase our commercial loans, our credit risk may increase;​•A substantial portion of our business is dependent on the prospects of the legal industry and changes in the legal industry may adversely affect our growth and profitability;​•A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans;​•We expect to increase our originations of consumer loans, including post-settlement consumer and structured settlement loans, and such loans generally carry greater risk than loans secured by owner-occupied, 1 – 4 family real estate, and these risks will increase as we continue to increase originations of these types of loans;​•As a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions;​•A substantial majority of our loans and operations are in New York, and therefore our business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the New York City economy;​•We rely heavily on our management team, our board of directors and our advisory board members and our business could be adversely affected by the unexpected loss of one or more of our officers or directors;​•We operate in a highly competitive industry and face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may decrease our growth or profits;​•We face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure;​•The occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;​•Our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in any of them; and​•An active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above the public offering price, or at all.​Corporate InformationOur principal executive offices are located at 100 Jericho Quadrangle, Suite 100, Jericho, New York 11753, and our telephone number at that address is (800) 996-0213.
An adverse development with respect to one loan or one Commercial Attorney-Related Loan credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a 1 – 4 family residential mortgage loan or a commercial real estate loan.Because we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, commercial loans generally have a larger average size as compared with other loans such as residential loans, and the collateral for commercial loans is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a disproportionate and material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.13TABLE OF CONTENTSA substantial portion of our business is dependent on the prospects of the legal industry and changes in the legal industry may adversely affect our growth and profitability.We depend on our relationships within the legal community and our products and services tailored to the legal industry account for a significant source of our revenue.
As we intend to focus our growth on our Attorney-Related Loan products, changes in the legal industry, including a significant decrease in the number of litigation cases in the United States, reform of the tort industry that reduces the ability of plaintiffs to bring cases or reduces the damages plaintiffs can receive, or a significant increase in the unemployment rate for attorneys, could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and growth of our business.A substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.At March 31, 2017, we had $92.8 million of multifamily loans and $21.3 million of commercial real estate loans.
