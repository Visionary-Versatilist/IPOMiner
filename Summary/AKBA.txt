We anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly if and as we:•continue our Phase 2b trial and prepare for a future Phase 3 development program of AKB-6548 for the treatment of anemia secondary to CKD;•seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;•have our product candidates manufactured for clinical trials and for commercial sale;•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;•initiate additional preclinical, clinical or other studies for AKB-6548, AKB-6899 and other product candidates that we may develop or acquire;•seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;•acquire or in-license other commercial products, product candidates and technologies;•make royalty, milestone or other payments under any future in-license agreements;•maintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;•attract and retain skilled personnel; and-11-Table of Contents•create additional infrastructure to support our operations as a public company.Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with
FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter
necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the rate of progress, results and cost of completing our Phase 2b clinical trial of AKB-6548 and our operating costs incurred as we conduct these

active operations in 2007, and our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical
trials for AKB-6548 because of negative publicity from adverse events observed in injectable rESAs, other investigational agents and commercial products in CKD or for other reasons, including competitive clinical studies for similar patient
product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or relating to manufacturing operations or processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the drug product, withdrawal of the drug product from the market, or drug product recalls;-18-Table of Contents•fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;•refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product
