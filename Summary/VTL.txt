We believe that the ELAD System therapy facilitates the recovery of liver function and has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and increase the likelihood of survival in patients with acute liver failure.We are currently enrolling subjects in one Phase 3 clinical trial, have regulatory allowance and sites open for enrollment in a second
have assembled this know-how through our ELAD System product development and believe that our proprietary banks of VTL C3A cells and manufacturing expertise create significant barriers to entry.If approved for marketing, the ELAD System will be eligible for 12 years of data exclusivity in the United States under the Biologics Price
our strategy to achieve this goal are:•Successfully complete the ELAD System’s clinical development in acute liver failure;•Obtain regulatory approval for the ELAD System in the United States and Europe;•Maximize the commercial potential of the ELAD System in the United States and Europe by establishing a targeted sales force focused on liver transplant and specialist intensive care centers;•Opportunistically explore commercial opportunities for the ELAD System in other international markets;•Continue to technically develop and improve our ELAD System and explore other uses for human liver-derived C3A cells, including the potential commercialization of proteins and other compounds produced by human
Some of these risks are:•We are a clinical-stage company with no approved products, which makes assessment of our future viability difficult;•We are totally dependent upon the success of the ELAD System, our sole product candidate, which is a combination product that may increase the complexity with both biologic and medical device regulatory issues;•We cannot give any assurance that we will successfully complete the ELAD System’s clinical development, or that it will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all;•If we fail to obtain regulatory approval in the United States and Europe, our business would be materially and adversely harmed;•If we are able to secure marketing approval, our commercial success will be determined by our ability to obtain acceptable pricing and reimbursement for the ELAD System therapy;•If we are unable to implement our sales, marketing, distribution, training and support strategies, we will not be able to effectively commercialize the ELAD System and may not reach profitability;•We have limited experience in conducting pivotal clinical trials used to support regulatory approval and prior clinical trials of the ELAD System did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in survival,
therapy necessary to gain approval;•Random variations in the standard of care could cause our clinical trials to fail;•Ethical considerations require us to conduct open-label clinical trials of the ELAD System where control subjects do not receive a sham treatment and this may introduce unacceptable bias into our trial results;•Even if VTI-208 is successful in demonstrating a statistically significant improvement over standard of care, a single Phase 3 clinical trial may not be sufficient to support regulatory approval of our ELAD System, and
otherwise not perform as anticipated;•Cellular therapy is complex and we do not have a complete understanding of the mechanism of action of the ELAD System;•Our patent rights may prove to be an inadequate barrier to competition and we do not hold any patents covering our VTL C3A cells or the production processes we use to grow the VTL C3A cells in the ELAD cartridges;5Table of Contents•We will need to raise additional capital; and•If we do not remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timeliness of our
