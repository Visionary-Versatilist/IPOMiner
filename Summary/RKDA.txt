market currently, we expect that it will take several years before the first products containing our agricultural yield traits complete the development process and become commercially available.
If products containing our traits fail to achieve market acceptance or generate significant revenues, we may never become profitable.If ongoing or future field trials by us or our collaborators are unsuccessful, we may be unable to complete the regulatory process for, or commercialize, our products in
