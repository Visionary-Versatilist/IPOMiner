If we cannot raise required funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) fund necessary general and administrative expenses depending on market demands for our products and services; (ii) fund certain obligations as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements.Failure to generate sufficient revenue to make payments on the Hard Rock Note could result in our loss of the patents securing such note.As amended and restated effective August 10, 2016, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15, 2020.
The failure to retain and use the Drill-N-Ream Collateral in our business could cause a significant loss of our investment and might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation, as well as our ability to grow our drill string tool business.Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in our business or our industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage.As noted above, we are required to make payments on the Hard Rock Note of $1.5 million (plus accrued interest) on or before October 15, 2016 ($1.0 million of which was paid through the issuance of 700,000 shares of common stock in connection with the amendment and restatement of the Hard Rock Note and the balance of which we intend pay using a portion of the proceeds of this offering), accrued interest only in 2017, $2.0 million (plus accrued interest) in 2018 and $4.0 million (plus accrued interest) for 2019, with the balance due on maturity in January 2020.
