We also expect our costs to increase in future periods as we continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:•development of our cloud-based platform, including investments in research and development, product innovation to expand the features and functionality of our
outsourcers, and resellers;•additional international expansion in an effort to increase our customer base and sales; and•general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company.These investments may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business.
