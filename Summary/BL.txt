prospective customer’s purchasing decision or affect customer retention;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•the impact of new accounting pronouncements; and•the timing and the amount of grants or vesting of equity awards to employees.Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our revenue, operating results and cash
Factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:•the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our software solutions;•the need to educate potential customers on the differences between traditional,on-premisesoftware and SaaS solutions;•the relatively long duration of the commitment customers make in their agreements with us;•the discretionary nature and timing of potential customers’ purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;•the competitive nature of potential customers’ evaluation and purchasing processes;•announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; and•lengthy purchasing approval processes of potential customers.We may incur higher costs and longer sales cycles as a result of large enterprises representing an increased portion of our revenue.

For one or more of those transactions, we may:•issue additional equity securities that would dilute our existing stockholders;•use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;•incur large charges or substantial liabilities;•incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to repay;•encounter difficulties retaining key employees of the acquired company or integrating diverse software codes or business cultures; and•become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation and amortization or deferred compensation charges.30Table of ContentsThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the
