changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could adversely affect our results of operations and cause fluctuations in our earnings and earnings per share.Our business depends on the continued effectiveness and availability of our information systems, including the information systems we use to provide our services to our
because of new scientific information or regulatory judgments that affect the drugs as a class or if industry consolidation results in the rationalization of drug development pipelines.Our business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.We have significant operations in non-U.S. countries that may require complex arrangements to deliver services on global contracts for our clients.

our services with respect to such drugs, which would prevent us from earning the full amount of service revenue anticipated under the related service contracts.Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our
business could thus be harmed materially by events outside our control.Risks Relating to Our IndebtednessOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.As of September 30, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $1.3 billion, including the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Credit
material adverse impact on our financial condition and the levels of cash we maintain for working capital.Risks Relating to Our Common Stock and This OfferingKKR will continue to have significant influence over us after this offering, including control over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, which could limit
a material adverse effect on our business and share price and could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely.We will incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.As a privately-held company, we were not required to comply with certain corporate governance and financial reporting practices and policies required
