our novel product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, would have a meaningful patient impact and significant commercial applications for the treatment of MDR infections in both the community and hospital settings.Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are one of the largest threats to global health, and their prevalence is increasing.
Pending further evidence ofin vivoactivity and positive results from our additional toxicity studies, we plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of SPR720 in the first half of 2019.4Table of ContentsOur PipelineThe following table sets forth our product candidates, their status, our current estimated development timeline and anticipated milestones.
If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.•Our clinical program for SPR994 is subject to a number of specific risks, including our use of a new formulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of SPR994 and our reliance, in part, on clinical data from two

The success of SPR994 and SPR741 will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain manufacturing supply;•obtainment and maintenance of patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally, including our ability to maintain our license agreement with Meiji with respect to
prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for SPR994, SPR741 or any of our other product candidates, including:•the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials;•we may not reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly
Our product candidate development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or marketing approvals and we may be required to obtain additional funds to complete clinical trials.
and policies adopted by the FDA, the EMA or similar regulatory authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials of SPR994, SPR741 and our other product candidates and potential product candidates.The FDA has established regulations to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities.
