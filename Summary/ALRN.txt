Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of our current and future clinical trials and additional preclinical research of ALRN-6924;•the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical research and clinical trials for our other product candidates;•the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;•our ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;•the success of any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties;•the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies, including entering into licensing or collaboration arrangements for product candidates, although we currently have no commitments or
agreements to complete any such transactions;•the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval, to the extent that
such sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution are not the responsibility of any collaborator that we may have at such time;•the amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;13Table of Contents•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;•our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and our research and development activities; and•the costs of operating as a public company.Our product candidates, if approved, may not
may never receive such marketing approvals.The success of ALRN-6924 will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful and timely completion of our ongoing clinical trials of ALRN-6924;•initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials on a timely basis;•safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;•timely receipt of marketing approvals for both ALRN-6924 and any required companion diagnostic from applicable regulatory authorities;•the performance of our future collaborators, if any;•the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;•establishment of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials and drug product suppliers and manufacturers;•establishment of scaled production arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished products that are appropriately packaged for sale;•obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;•protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including our licensed intellectual property;•successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval;•a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;•commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and•our ability to compete with other therapies.We do not have complete control over many of

Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of
patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, it will be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation would have a material adverse effect on our business.Our commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary
