We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties that companies at a similar stage of development frequently experience, including the potential failure to:●obtain sufficient working capital and increase our registered capital to support expansion of our loan and guarantee portfolios;●comply with any changes in the laws and regulations of the PRC or local province that may affect our lending operations;●expand our borrowers base;●maintain adequate control of default risks and expenses allowing us to realize anticipated revenue growth;●implement our customer development, risk management and acquisition strategies and adapt and modify them as needed;●integrate any future acquisitions; and●anticipate and adapt to changing conditions in the Chinese lending industry resulting from changes in government regulations, mergers and acquisitions involving our competitors, and other significant competitive and market dynamics.If we are unable to address any or all of the foregoing risks, our business may be materially and adversely affected.PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investments in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies have delayed us from using the entire proceeds from our initial public offering to increase the registered capital of Wujiang Luxiang.As an offshore holding company with PRC subsidiaries, we may transfer funds to our PRC subsidiaries or finance our operating entity by means of loans or capital contributions.
The delay in receiving the approval to use the $1.4 million from our initial pubic offering to increase Wujiang Luxiang’s registered capital, currently prevents us from further expanding Wujiang Luxiang’s business.Our current operations in China are geographically limited to the city of Wujiang.In accordance with the PRC state and provincial laws and regulations with regard to microcredit companies, we are not allowed to make loans and provide guarantees to businesses and individuals located outside of the city of Wujiang.Our future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of the economy in the city of Wujiang.
Due to the restriction that our interest rate cannot be higher than three times the PBOC Benchmark Rate pursuant to certain Jiangsu banking regulations released in October 2012, if we have to reduce the interest rate we charge the borrowers to reflect the decrease of the PBOC Benchmark Rate, our interest rate spread will be negatively affected.As a microcredit company, our business is subject to greater credit risks than larger lenders, which could adversely affect our results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with our lending and guarantee activities, including credit risk, which is the risk that borrowers may not repay the outstanding loans balances in our direct loan business or that we may not recover the full amount of the payment we made to the lender in our guarantee business.
If we cannot establish such controls, or if we are unable to collect the financial data required for the preparation of our financial statements, or if we are unable to keep our books and accounts in accordance with the U.S. accounting standards for business, we may not be able to continue to file required reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which would likely have a material adverse affect on the performance of our shares of common stock.WFOE’s ability to pay dividends to us may be restricted due to foreign exchange control and other regulations of China.As an offshore holding company, we may rely principally on dividends from our subsidiaries in China, WFOE and PFL, for our cash requirements.
If the PRC courts or regulatory authorities determine that our contractual arrangements are in violation of applicable PRC laws, rules or regulations, our contractual arrangements will become invalid or unenforceable.If WFOE, Wujiang Luxiang, Pride Online or their ownership structure or the contractual arrangements, are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws, rules or regulations, or WFOE, Pride Online or Wujiang Luxiang fails to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:●revoking the business and operating licenses of WFOE, Pride Online or Wujiang Luxiang;●discontinuing or restricting the operations of WFOE, Pride Online or Wujiang Luxiang;●imposing conditions or requirements with which we, WFOE, Pride Online or Wujiang Luxiang may not be able to comply;●requiring us, WFOE, Pride Online or Wujiang Luxiang to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;28●restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from our initial public offering to finance our business and operations in China; or●imposing fines.The imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.On or around September 2011, various media sources reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (the “CSRC”) had prepared a report proposing pre-approval by a competent central government authority of offshore listings by China-based companies with variable interest entity structures, such as ours, that operate in industry sectors subject to foreign investment restrictions.
