Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:•our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments or to pay dividends;•we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms;25Table of Contents•we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;•we anticipate that a significant portion of our debt will bear interest at variable rates, and increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense;•we may be unable to distribute funds from a property to our operating partnership or apply such funds to cover expenses related to another property;•we could be required to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on disadvantageous terms;•we could default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases;•we could violate covenants in our loan documents, including provisions that may limit our ability to further mortgage a property, make distributions, acquire additional properties,
Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on:•our current debt levels, which were $295.9 million of pro forma consolidated debt and $195.0 million of unconsolidated debt as of June 30, 2004;•our current cash flow from operating activities, which was $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2004;•our current and expected future earnings;•the market’s perception of our growth potential;•the market price per share of our common stock; and•general market conditions.If we cannot obtain capital from third-party sources, we may not be able to acquire or develop properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our
contemplated in the forward-looking statements:•our inability to consummate the acquisition transactions described in this prospectus;•our dependence on our relationships with CalSTRS and restrictions on our ability to expand and diversify our revenue sources;•our lack of significant control in some of our joint ventures with third parties, including our joint venture with CalSTRS;•the lack of arms’-length negotiations relating to our master contribution agreement and formation transactions;•our reliance on revenue from significant tenants;•events giving rise to our tax indemnification obligations with respect to Mr. Thomas in connection with two of our properties;•the impact of adverse economic or real estate developments in the three regional markets in which we are currently active;•failure to obtain necessary third party financing;•defaults on or non-renewal of leases by tenants;•increased interest rates, tax rates, insurance and other operating costs;•difficulties in identifying properties to acquire and completing acquisitions;•our failure to successfully operate acquired properties and operations;•our failure to successfully develop or manage properties;•lower market rents or increased vacancy rates;•the effect on us of tax legislation or other legislation relating to or affecting the ownership of our properties; and•environmental uncertainties and risks related to natural disasters.For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the information under the
