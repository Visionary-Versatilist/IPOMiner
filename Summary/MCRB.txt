The success of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:•completion of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials with positive results;•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates;•making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for, or establishing our own, commercial manufacturing capabilities;•launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•entering into new collaborations throughout the development process as appropriate, from pre-clinical studies through to commercialization;•acceptance of our products, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•effectively competing with other therapies;•obtaining and maintaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government payors, for our products, if approved;•protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;•operating without infringing or violating the valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property of third parties;•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the products following approval; and•maintaining and growing an organization of scientists and business people who can develop and commercialize our products and technology.If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates based upon our technological approach, we will
unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:•regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective
only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:•be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;•lose the support of any future collaborators, requiring us to bear more of the burden of development of certain compounds;•not obtain marketing approval at all;•obtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;•obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intend or desire;17Table of Contents•obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;•be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or•have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.We recently completed our Phase 1b/2 clinical study of SER-109 and dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical study for this product candidate
competitors to bring products to market before we do, potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harming our business and results of operations.If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or
from which to draw for clinical studies.Patient enrollment is also affected by other factors including:•the severity of the disease under investigation;•the patient eligibility criteria for the study in question;•the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;•the availability of other treatments for the disease under investigation;•the existence of competing clinical trials;•the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;•our payments for conducting clinical trials;18Table of Contents•the patient referral practices of physicians;•the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and•the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon
Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional
Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, applicable regulatory approval would delay or prevent commercialization of SER-109 and would materially adversely impact our business and prospects.The development of therapeutic products targeting the underlying biology of the human microbiome is an emerging field, and it is possible that the
The degree of market acceptance of our approved product candidates, if any, will depend on a number of factors, including:•their efficacy, safety and other potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;•the clinical indications for which our products are approved;•our ability to offer them for sale at competitive prices;•their convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates;•the prevalence and severity of their side effects and their overall safety profiles;•any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications;•interactions of our products with other medicines patients are taking; and•inability of certain types of patients to take our product.24Table of ContentsWe currently have no sales organization.
eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:•regulatory investigations, product recalls or withdrawals, or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;•decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;•injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;•withdrawal of clinical trial participants;27Table of Contents•significant costs to defend the related litigation;•substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;•loss of revenue;•reduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and•the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.We currently hold $3.0 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per occurrence limit of $3.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur.
The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:•the success of competitive products or technologies;•actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;•results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;•developments related to any future collaborations;•regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;•development of new product candidates that may address our markets and may make our product candidates less attractive;•changes in physician, hospital or healthcare provider practices that may make our product candidates less useful;•announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;•developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;•the recruitment or departure of key personnel;•the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;•failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;•the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;•actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;•variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;•changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;•market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;•general economic, industry and market conditions; and•the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section.After this offering, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, if they choose to act together, will continue to have the ability to control or significantly influence all matters submitted
