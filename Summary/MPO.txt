Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects, including the following:•shortages of, or delays in, obtaining equipment and qualified personnel;•facility or equipment malfunctions;•unexpected operational events;•pressure or irregularities in geological formations;•adverse weather conditions;•reductions in oil and natural gas prices;•delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;•proximity to and capacity of transportation facilities;•title problems; and•limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.18Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will not be the same as
We could incur additional impairments of oil and natural gas properties in the future, particularly as a result of a decline in commodity prices.19Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since the beginning of 2008 and may continue to

In the future, we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties.Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:•a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;•a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay
Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.Derivative instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:•production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;•the counter-party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or•there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for basis differentials.In addition, our derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil.All of our operations are located in central Louisiana, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area.As of December 31, 2011, all of our proved reserves and our annual production were located in central Louisiana.
a material adverse effect on our business and financial results if a comparable additional location to drill a development well cannot be identified.We may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, and the integration of significant acquisitions may be difficult.We periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within
cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this prospectus.These factors include:•variations in the market demand for, and prices of, oil and natural gas;•uncertainties about our estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves;•the adequacy of our capital resources and liquidity including, but not limited to, access to additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility;•access to capital and general economic and business conditions;•uncertainties about our ability to replace reserves and economically develop our current reserves;•risks related to the concentration of our operations onshore in central Louisiana;•drilling results;•the potential adoption of new governmental regulations; and•our ability to satisfy future cash obligations and environmental costs.These cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf.Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way.
