In order to achieve this goal, we intend to:•Complete clinical development of eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI and seek regulatory approval.•Directly commercialize eravacycline in the United States with a targeted hospital sales force.•Establish one or more collaborations for the development and commercialization of eravacycline outside the United States.•Pursue development of eravacycline for other serious and life-threatening infections, such as hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonias.•Opportunistically advance development of other product candidates created using our proprietary chemistry technology.Recent Operating ResultsWe have

Our expenses also will increase if and as we:•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•in-license or acquire other products and technologies;•hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue.
unless and until we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, eravacycline, which will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including:•commencing and successfully completing Phase 3 clinical trials of eravacycline;•applying for and obtaining marketing approval for eravacycline;•protecting and maintaining our rights to our intellectual property portfolio related to eravacycline;•contracting for the manufacture of commercial quantities of eravacycline; and•establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to effectively market and sell eravacycline.13Table of ContentsBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product
approval for eravacycline or any other product candidate that we develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing.We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
will not achieve the progress that we expect with respect to eravacycline because the actual costs and timing of clinical development activities are difficult to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays.Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.
including:•the timing, design and costs of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial of eravacycline for the treatment of cIAI and our planned Phase 3 clinical trial of eravacycline for the treatment of cUTI;•the timing and costs of developing eravacycline for additional indications, including hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonias and other serious and life-threatening infections;•the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other product candidates and potential product candidates;•the amount of funding that we receive under our subcontracts awarded to us by our collaborator CUBRC, Inc., or CUBRC, under its government contracts with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or
additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, including purchasers of common stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.Upon completion of this offering, our only external source of funds will be funding under subcontracts and a subaward awarded to us by CUBRC
The success of eravacycline will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of clinical trials;•receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•establishment of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain manufacturing supply;•obtainment and maintenance of patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity;•protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;•launch of commercial sales of eravacycline, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•acceptance of eravacycline, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•competition with other therapies; and•a continued acceptable safety profile of eravacycline following approval.Successful
affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which could delay or prevent us from generating revenues from the sale of our products and harm our business and results of operations.Even if eravacycline or any other product candidate that we develop receives marketing approval, it may fail to achieve the degree
intravenous-to-oral step-down therapy;•the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;•whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the approval of other new products for the same indications;•the timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;•the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;•availability and level of coverage and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third party payors;•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;•adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and•the development of resistance by bacterial strains to the product.21Table of ContentsIn addition, the potential market opportunity for eravacycline is difficult to estimate.
If we are unable to establish a sales force and marketing and distribution capabilities, our operating results may be adversely affected.Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:•our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;•the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future products;•the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and•unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.We plan to commercialize eravacycline outside the United States with the assistance of collaborators.
can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of a product candidate that we license to a third party.Collaborations involving our product candidates may pose a number of risks, including the following:•collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;•collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected or in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements;•collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the
distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of any resulting products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.We contract with third parties for the manufacture of eravacycline for clinical trials and expect to continue to do so in connection
