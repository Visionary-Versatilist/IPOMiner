These risks are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus immediately following this prospectus summary.•We have incurred losses in the past and may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.​•We may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing commercial operations, develop and commercialize new products and expand our operations.​•Our long-term growth depends on our ability to commercialize our products in development and to develop and commercialize additional products through our research and development efforts, and if we fail to do so we may be unable to compete effectively.​•We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our products to achieve and sustain profitability.​•We lack published long-term data supporting superior clinical outcomes by our products, which could limit sales.​•If coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products significantly decline, orthopedic surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline.​•We may be unable to successfully demonstrate to orthopedic surgeons the merits of our products compared to those of our competitors.​•Our products and our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could harm our business.​•We rely on a network of third-party independent sales agencies and distributors to market and distribute our products, and if we are unable to maintain and expand this network, we may be unable to generate anticipated sales.​•If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.​Implications of Being an Emerging Growth CompanyAs a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies.
If our available cash balances, borrowing capacity, net proceeds from this offering and anticipated cash flow from operations are12TABLE OF CONTENTSinsufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower demand for our products as a result of the risks described in this prospectus, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into an additional credit facility or another form of third-party funding or seek other debt financing.We may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons, including to:•increase our sales and marketing efforts to increase market adoption of our products and address competitive developments;​•provide for supply and inventory costs associated with plans to accommodate potential increases in demand for our products;​•fund development and marketing efforts of any future products or additional features to then-current products;​•acquire, license or invest in new technologies;​•acquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and​•finance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.​Our present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:•our ability to achieve revenue growth and improve gross margins;​•our rate of progress in establishing coverage and reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international commercial third-party payors and government payors;​•the cost of expanding our operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;​•our rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of our products;​•the cost of research and development activities;​•the effect of competing technological and market developments;​•costs related to international expansion; and​•the potential cost of and delays in product development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our products.​Additional capital may not be available at such times or in amounts as needed by us.
If access to sufficient capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail one or more product development or commercialization programs, or we may be required to significantly reduce expenses, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors or liquidate all our assets.Our sales volumes and our results of operations may fluctuate over the course of the year.We have experienced and continue to experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, which may include, among other things:13TABLE OF CONTENTS•the number of products sold in the quarter;​•the unpredictability of sales of full sets of implants and instruments to our international distributors;​•the demand for, and pricing of, our products and the products of our competitors;​•the timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for our products;​•the costs, benefits and timing of new product introductions;​•increased competition;​•the availability and cost of components and materials;​•the number of selling days in the quarter;​•fluctuation and foreign currency exchange rates; or​•impairment and other special charges.​Our loan and security agreement with Squadron Capital LLC contains covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.In April 2017, we entered into a third amended and restated loan and security agreement, or the Loan Agreement, with Squadron Capital LLC, or Squadron.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Indebtedness — Loan Agreement.”14TABLE OF CONTENTSIf we do not have or are unable to generate sufficient cash available to repay our debt obligations when they become due and payable, either upon maturity or in the event of a default, we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which may negatively impact our ability to operate and continue our business as a going concern.Risks Related to Our Business and StrategyOur long-term growth depends on our ability to commercialize our products in development and to develop and commercialize additional products through our research and development efforts, and if we fail to do so we may be unable to compete effectively.In order to increase our market share in the pediatric orthopedic markets, we must successfully commercialize our current products in development, enhance our existing product offerings and introduce new products in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressures and technologies.
Convincing orthopedic surgeons to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we may not be successful in these efforts.Although we believe our interactions with orthopedic surgeons are conducted in compliance with FDA, federal and state fraud and abuse and other applicable laws and regulations developed both nationally and in foreign countries, if the FDA or other competent authority determines that any of our activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use or promotion of an intended purpose not covered by FDA approved labeling or the current European Union product certification, or CE Mark, affixed to our product, they could request that we modify our activities, issue corrective advertising or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalty.
Our international business operations are subject to a variety of risks, including:•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign and geographically dispersed operations;​•having to comply with various U.S. and international laws, including export control laws and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, and anti-money laundering laws;​​24TABLE OF CONTENTS•differing regulatory requirements for obtaining clearances or approvals to market our products;​•changes in, or uncertainties relating to, foreign rules and regulations that may impact our ability to sell our products, perform services or repatriate profits to the United States;​•tariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets;​•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;​•imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures;​•differing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors or patient self-pay systems;​•imposition of differing labor laws and standards;​•economic, political or social instability in foreign countries and regions;​•an inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action; and​•availability of government subsidies or other incentives that benefit competitors in their local markets that are not available to us.​We expect we will continue expanding into other international markets; however, our expansion plans may not be realized, or if realized, may not be successful.
