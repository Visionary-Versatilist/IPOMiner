Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including:•the portion of our revenue attributable to software-as-a-service, or SaaS, and license versus hardware and other sales;•fluctuations in demand, including due to seasonality, for our platform and solutions;•changes in pricing by us in response to competitive pricing actions;•our ability to increase, retain and incentivize the service providers that market, sell, install and support our platform and solutions;•the ability of our hardware vendors to continue to manufacture high-quality products and to supply sufficient products to meet our demands;•the timing and success of introductions of new solutions, products or upgrades by us or our competitors and the entrance of new competitors;•changes in our business and pricing policies or those of our competitors;•the ability to accurately forecast revenue as we generally rely upon our service provider network to generate new revenue;•our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and the costs of the hardware we purchase;•competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;•our ability to successfully manage any future acquisitions of businesses;•issues related to introductions of new or improved products such as shortages of prior generation products or short-term decreased demand for next generation products;•the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, increasing research and development, introducing new solutions or paying litigation expenses;•the ability to effectively manage growth within existing and new markets domestically and abroad;17Table of Contents•changes in the payment terms for our platform and solutions;•the strength of regional, national and global economies; and•the impact of natural disasters or manmade problems such as terrorism.Due to the foregoing factors and
