key competitive strengths:·Proprietary Technologies.Our research and development efforts since our inception in 1979 have resulted in the development of DC power systems with proprietary software and controls that are configured to meet the specific needs of our customers.
In addition, we have invested significant resources in developing technologies that improve fuel efficiency and generate lower emissions than conventional solutions available in the marketplace.·Engineering Expertise.We have a customer-centric approach, and we continually
key engineers each have over 25 years of engineering and production experience in the design and manufacturing of power systems.·Supply Chain Competitiveness.Our growth in sales volumes has enabled us to
The primary elements of our growth strategy include:·Further develop U.S. mobile telecommunications market.We plan to increase our direct sales infrastructure nationwide to promote our DC power systems to all the regions in the U.S., including mid-level mobile telecommunications tower service companies.
We also plan to qualify additional independent telecommunications tower service providers to increase our aftermarket service infrastructure nationwide.·Expand DC power systems sales into new geographic markets.We believe a significant opportunity exists for sales of our DC power systems to telecommunication customers located in developing nations, such as India, China and Sub-Saharan Africa.
DC power systems will provide us with an opportunity to increase our product offerings within the data center and telecommunications
output capacity up to 200 kW.·Expand renewable solar energy product offerings.We plan to expand our DC solar hybrid power system product line to address off-grid and bad-grid applications in telecommunications and military markets worldwide.
In particular, risks associated with our business include:·We are dependent on a limited number of customers.·To date, we have derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our DC base power systems to Verizon Wireless within the telecommunications market.
Our efforts to expand our product portfolio or markets within which we operate may not succeed, and may reduce our revenue growth rate.·Many of our DC power systems involve long design and sales cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial performance.·The high concentration of our sales within the telecommunications market could result in a significant reduction in sales and negatively affect our profitability if demand for our DC power systems within this market declines.·We may need to raise additional capital to fund our international operations, commercialize new products and further expand our existing operations.·If we are unable to continue to develop new and enhanced products and technologies that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner, our competitive position and operating results could be harmed.·If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we could lose important proprietary technology, which could materially and adversely affect our business.·Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer owns and will own after this offering a majority of our common stock and will exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, regardless of the wishes of other stockholders.Implications of Being an Emerging Growth CompanyWe are an “emerging growth company,”
include:·only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure in this prospectus;·reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;·no requirement that we hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and·exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.We have elected to adopt certain
