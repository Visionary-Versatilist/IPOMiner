grow production.Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:•the prices at which our production is sold;•our proved reserves;•the amount of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;•our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;•the amount of our operating expenses;•cash settlements from our derivative activities;•our ability to borrow under our new revolving credit facility; and•our ability to access the capital markets.If our revenues or the borrowing base under our new revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operational difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other
anticipated, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, production and
acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.Our decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend, in part, on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical
drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.We enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production.
addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs or from reductions in interest rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.
Our ability to drill and develop our acreage and establish production to maintain our leases depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and
These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.Historically, our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices.
