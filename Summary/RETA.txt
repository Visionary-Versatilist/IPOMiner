degree of participation by our collaborators;•the costs to initiate and continue research, preclinical, and clinical development efforts for any future product candidates;•the costs associated with identifying additional product candidates;•the costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, if any, for our product candidates in the United States and other jurisdictions, and the costs of
