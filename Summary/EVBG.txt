revenue recognition also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers generally is recognized over the applicable agreement term.We operate in an emerging and evolving market, which may develop more slowly or differently than we expect.
Fluctuations in our results of operations may be due to a number of factors, including:•fluctuations in demand for our platform and applications;•changes in our business or pricing policies in response to competitive pricing actions or otherwise;•the timing and success of introductions of new applications or upgrades to our platform;•the impact of acquisition transaction-related amortization expenses and other certain expenses on our gross profit;•competition, including entry into the industry by new competitors and new offerings by existing competitors;•changes in the business or pricing policies of our competitors;•the amount and timing of expenditures, including those related to expanding our operations, increasing research and development, enhancing our platform, introducing new applications or growing our sales and marketing
Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:•currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future;•economic or political instability in foreign markets;•greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;•more stringent regulations relating to technology, including with respect to privacy, data security and the unauthorized use of, access to, or deletion of commercial and personal information, particularly in the
these locations;•challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;28Table of Contents•difficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;•limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;•limited or insufficient intellectual property protection;•political instability or terrorist activities;•likelihood of potential or actual violations of domestic and international anticorruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, or of U.S. and international export control and
