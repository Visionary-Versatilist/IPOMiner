forces.We believe prominent drivers of supply include:·The declining cost and higher availability of energy storage technologies, specifically the cost and capacity of rechargeable lithium ion batteries;·Grants, loans, tax breaks, and other financial support available for energy storage and electric vehicle research and development;·Requirements that a specific percentage of automakers’ models be electric or other zero-emission vehicles; and·Fuel economy standards that require automakers to meet certain fleet-wide benchmarks.1We believe prominent drivers of demand include:·Mandates that government fleets purchase certain percentages of low emission, energy efficient, or alternative fuel vehicles;·Mandates for transport agencies, ports or school districts to purchase or convert to electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;·Rebates, tax credits, and other incentives for purchasing or leasing electric or other alternative fuel vehicles;·The availability of charging stations and other charging infrastructure, driven in turn by government funding, tax credits, rebates, and other incentives and regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing the number of charging stations;·The cost of electricity to recharge plug-in electric vehicles, or PEVs, impacted by special rates introduced by utilities;·Preferential treatment in registration, emissions testing, and access to highways, city centers, and high occupancy vehicle, or HOV, lanes; and·The cost of conventional diesel or gasoline and the resultant incremental costs of owning and operating an electric vehicle versus a conventionally fueled equivalent.Fleet Operator ChallengesIn addition, fleet operators and their companies
face a number of challenges, including:·Difficulty complying with existing and new federal and state emission restrictions and compliance requirements;·Finding cost savings while managing high fuel, maintenance and repair costs;·Extending the lives of existing vehicles;·Difficulty planning for the operation of their fleet when fuel supplies are interrupted, such as during a natural disaster; and·Difficulty in improving the environment around these heavy-duty commercial fleets.Our SolutionWe design advanced zero-emission electric and
We have multiple product offerings including zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains, new purpose-built zero-emission electric vehicles and stationary energy storage solutions and, as a result, the ability to scale-up, scale-down or refine a specific product line in response to market demands and the evolving local, state and federal regulatory and incentive programs.
By taking an active role in many trade industry groups and related events, we have developed and continually strive to maintain strong relationships with key local, state and federal regulatory agencies involved in the growing zero-emission and hybrid vehicle industry.
These potential additional sales could include: automated charging infrastructure, intelligent stationary energy storage systems that enable higher levels of vehicle fast-charging, emergency back-up facility power for use during grid power outages, enabling technologies to access the developing grid-connected opportunities for the aggregate power available from groups of large battery packs, or enabling technologies that allow for the avoidance of electric utility demand charges.·Unique Market Knowledge.
As new markets develop, we plan to expand our zero-emission systems into ancillary product verticals, such as charging infrastructure also called Electric Vehicle Service Equipment, stationary energy storage, vehicle-to-grid hardware and capabilities.·Develop Our International Business.
While we believe that China is an important market for us due in part to its publicly announced emphasis on hybrid and all-electric vehicles and large population, we remain in the early stages of the development of our business plan to pursue such opportunities, including the consideration of a proposal to develop a facility in Nantong, China to fulfill conversion kit orders within China, and continue to assess the logistics and costs associated with the production and sale of our zero-emission drivetrains into China.Selected Risks Associated with Our Business and IndustryAn investment in our securities involves a
These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:·we may not successfully execute our business plan to generate revenue and create a sustainable growth trajectory;·we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future;·our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed in its report on our audited consolidated financial statements a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;·our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and may increase the risk of your investment;·our future growth is dependent upon demand for conversion of existing diesel- and gasoline-powered buses, truck and other fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrain systems and demand for new buses, trucks and other fleet vehicles with zero-emission drivetrains;·we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors;·our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before executing a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and generate revenue from those customers;·developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for electric vehicles and our drivetrains;·we may be unable to keep up with advances in zero-emission electric drivetrain or hybrid vehicle technology;·the demand for commercial zero-emission electric and hybrid vehicles may decrease, as it depends, in part, on the continuation of current trends resulting from dependence on fossil fuels;·we may not be able to reduce and adequately control the costs and expenses associated with operating our business;·we may fail to manage our growth effectively and we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or address competitive challenges adequately;4·our zero-emission and hybrid drivetrains may fail to perform as expected;·we are dependent on third parties to deliver raw materials, parts, components and services in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner and at reasonable prices, quality levels and volumes;·our business success depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationship with third parties;·we may not be able to scale our manufacturing, assembling, and converting processes effectively and quickly from low volume production to high volume production;·we may become subject to product liability claims;·we may be compelled to undertake product recalls;·we may be unable to design, develop, market and sell our zero-emission electric and hybrid drivetrains or related products and services that address additional market opportunities;·our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and incentives and the application of regulations that encourage conversion to electric or hybrid vehicles, or replacing traditional petroleum-fueled vehicles with electric or hybrid vehicles;·our service model may be costly for us to operate and may not address the service requirements of our prospective customers;·our decentralized assembly, sales and service model will present numerous challenges and we may not be able to execute on our plan to establish sales, service and assembly facilities in the urban areas we have targeted and our facilities in any of those markets may underperform relative to our expectations;·we are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or any failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results;·any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology;·in many of our zero-emission electric or hybrid drivetrains we use battery packs composed of lithium-ion battery cells, which, if not appropriately managed and controlled, on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flames; and·we may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research and development tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.Implications of Being an Emerging Growth CompanyWe qualify as an “emerging growth company”
