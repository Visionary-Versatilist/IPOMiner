entitled "Forward-Looking Statements."Risks Relating to Our BusinessThe loss of or changes in our relationships with GSEs, HUD and institutional investors would adversely affect our ability to originate commercial real estate loans through
to increased market concerns about the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to withstand future credit losses associated with securities on which they provide guarantees and loans
existence of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could eliminate or substantially reduce the number of loans we originate, which would have a material adverse effect on us.We are subject to risk of loss in connection with defaults on loans sold under the Fannie Mae DUS program that could materially and adversely affect our results of
over time and may be materially and adversely affected by a number of factors, including competitors that may be willing to provide similar services at better rates.We originate mostly multifamily and other commercial real estate loans that are eligible for sale through GSE or HUD programs, which focus may expose us to greater risk if
liquidity in the commercial real estate finance market significantly increases, there may be less demand for loans that are eligible for sale through GSE or HUD programs, and our loan origination
were in breach of a covenant in one of our warehouse facilities that required the delinquency rate of the Fannie Mae loans on which we have risk-sharing to not increase more than 0.5% from
the event of a breach of any representation or warranty, investors could, among other things, increase the level of risk-sharing on the Fannie Mae DUS loan or require us to repurchase
Any such reduction could materially and adversely affect us.For most loans that we service under the Fannie Mae and HUD programs, we are required to advance payments due to investors if the borrower is delinquent in making such
Securitizing our loans would subject us to numerous additional risks, including:•delayed operating cash flows;•conditions in the general securities and securitization markets;•the need to obtain satisfactory credit enhancements;•retention of credit enhancing residual interests;•increased potential for earnings fluctuations; and•risk of mismatch between securitization yields and borrowing rates on our warehouse and other loan funding debt.20Table of ContentsIf
