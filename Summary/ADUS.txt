consider making to address their budget deficits include:•limiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;•redefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of homecare services under those programs;•increasing the consumer’s share of costs or co-payment requirements;•decreasing the number of authorized hours for recipients;•slowing payments to providers;•increasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or “all inclusive” programs; or•shifting beneficiaries to managed care programs.Certain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate.
If changes in Medicaid policy result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer, our net service revenues could be negatively impacted.Delays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits or otherwise have decreased, and may in the future further decrease, our liquidity.There is generally a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services.
