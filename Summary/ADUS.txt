http://www.medpac.gov/chapters/Jun09DataBookSec9.pdf.We believe growth in homecare is being driven by the following trends:•an aging population;•consumer preference to receive care in the home or in a community-based setting; and•the cost-effectiveness of the provision of care in the home.In addition to the projected growth of government-sponsored homecare services, the private duty market for our services is rapidly growing.
under the heading “Risk Factors,” such as:•changes to Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability;•delays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits or otherwise have decreased, and may in the future further decrease, our liquidity;•the implementation or expansion of self-directed care programs in states in which we operate may limit our ability to increase our market share and could
adversely affect our revenue;•failure to renew a significant agreement or group of related agreements may materially impact our revenue;•our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific, with limited barriers to entry;•our profitability could be negatively affected by a reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other payors;•we are subject to extensive government regulation; and•our current principal stockholders will continue to have significant influence over us after this offering.Company InformationAddus HomeCare Corporation

before deciding to purchase any shares of our common stock.Risks Related to Our BusinessChanges to Medicaid, Medicaid waiver or other state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our net service revenues and profitability.For the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we derived 80%, 81% and 82%, respectively, of our net service
consider making to address their budget deficits include:•limiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates;•redefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of homecare services under those programs;•increasing the consumer’s share of costs or co-payment requirements;•decreasing the number of authorized hours for recipients;•slowing payments to providers;•increasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives or “all inclusive” programs; or•shifting beneficiaries to managed care programs.Certain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate.
If changes in Medicaid policy result in a reduction in available funds for the services we offer, our net service revenues could be negatively impacted.Delays in reimbursement due to state budget deficits or otherwise have decreased, and may in the future further decrease, our liquidity.There is generally a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services.

Furthermore, any failure to comply with these laws, including even a seemingly minor infraction, can result in significant penalties which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.In addition, certain individuals and entities, known as excluded persons, are prohibited from receiving payment for their services

Our existing credit facility includes non-financial covenants including the following significant requirements that generally:•do not allow us to borrow additional debt without the approval of our lenders;•do not allow us to grant additional security interests in our assets;•do not allow us to become liable with respect to contingent obligations;•allow us to dispose of assets only in accordance with the terms of our existing credit facility;•restrict our ability to pay dividends without the approval of our lenders; and•prohibit us from impairing our lenders’ security interest in our assets.We intend to enter into a new credit facility at the completion of this offering.
Our new credit facility is also expected to include non-financial covenants including restrictions on our ability to:•transfer assets, enter into mergers, make acquisitions or experience fundamental changes;•make investments, loans and advances;•incur additional indebtedness and guarantee obligations;•create liens on assets;•make dividends and distributions;•enter into affiliate transactions;•enter into transactions other than in the ordinary course of business;•incur capital lease obligations; and•make capital expenditures.The restrictions in our existing credit facility and those proposed to be included in our new credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our ability to take actions that may be in our best interests.We may not be able to attract, train and retain qualified personnel.We must attract and retain qualified personnel in the markets in which we operate in order to provide our services.
Accordingly, certain public health catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees.Our success depends upon the continued employment of certain members of our senior management team.
Eos Funds will have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including:•changes to the composition of our board of directors, which has the authority to direct our business and appoint and remove our officers;•proposed mergers, consolidations or other business combinations; and•amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which govern the rights attached to our shares of common stock.In addition, we anticipate that at least two of our directors immediately following the completion of this offering will be affiliated with the Eos
The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:•our operating and financial performance;•variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;•the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;•future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur;•investor perception of our business and our prospects;•developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations;•changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; or•general economic and stock market conditions.In addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of homecare companies.
payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.If securities or industry analysts fail to publish research or reports about our business or publish negative research or reports, or our results are below analysts’ estimates, our stock price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock may depend in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts
exercised or converted, or if we issue additional shares of our common stock at prices lower than our net tangible book value at such time or in respect of acquisitions.Provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, both of which will be effective prior to the completion of this
