annual revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may vary significantly in the future depending on factors such as:•budgeting cycles of our customers;•the length of our sales cycle;•increased competition;•our ability to develop innovative products;•the timing of new product releases by us or our competitors;•market acceptance of our products;•changes in our and our competitors’ pricing policies;•the financial condition of our current and potential customers;•changes in the regulatory environment;•changes in operating expenses and personnel changes;•our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel;•the effect of potential acquisitions and consequent integration;10Table of Contents•changes in our business strategy; and•general economic factors, including factors relating to the disruptions in the world credit and equity markets and the related impact on our
significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of these customers could also have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivables, our liquidity and our future operating results.If our customers cancel their contracts or terminate or delay their clinical trials, we may lose or delay revenues and our business
single-study arrangement could result in decreased revenues and the delay of our customers’ clinical trials could result in delayed professional services revenues, which could materially harm our business.We currently have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our revenue recognition and
If the cost of meeting these data storage and management requirements increases, our results of operations could be harmed.13Table of ContentsIn March 2008 we acquired Fast Track, a provider of clinical trial planning solutions,
For example, in March 2008, we acquired Fast Track.Acquisitions, including the Fast Track acquisition, involve numerous risks, including some or all of the following:•difficulties in identifying and acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses;•substantial cash expenditures;•incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which we may not identify at the time of acquisition;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;•diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns;•risk associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience;•potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the target company’s business; and•delays in customer purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses.If we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
credit and equity markets;•political instability;14Table of Contents•longer payment cycles;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and enforcement of agreements;•compliance with foreign laws;•changes in regulatory requirements;•fewer legal protections for intellectual property and contract rights;•tariffs or other trade barriers;•difficulties in obtaining export licenses;•staffing and managing foreign operations;•exposure to currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations;•transportation delays;•potentially adverse tax consequences; and•recently proposed changes to taxation of offshore earnings.Moreover, with regard to our international operations, we frequently enter into transactions in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and we
our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including•our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;•general economic and stock market conditions, including the disruptions in the world credit and equity markets;•the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;•future sales of our common stock; and•the other factors described in these “Risk Factors.”In recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and
