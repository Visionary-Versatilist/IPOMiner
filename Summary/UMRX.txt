Key elements of our strategy include the following objectives:•Expedite clinical development, regulatory approval,and commercialization of our product candidate ACTR087 used in combination with rituximab.We

Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of clinical product supplies or product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.•We depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.5Table of ContentsConcurrent Private PlacementSeattle Genetics has agreed to purchase from us, concurrently with this offering in a private placement, $5.0 million of shares of our common

that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:•differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;•difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;•challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting fromgeo-politicalactions, including war and terrorism.These and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain

Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:•decreased demand for our product candidates or products that we may develop;•injury to our reputation;•withdrawal of clinical trial participants;•initiation of investigations by regulators;•costs to defend the related litigation;•a diversion of management’s time and our resources;•substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;•product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;•loss of revenue;•exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;•the inability to commercialize any product candidate; and•a decline in our share price.Failure to obtain or retain sufficient product liability
