Our ability14TABLE OF CONTENTSto generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including but not limited to:•completing research and nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates;•obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies;•establishing collaborations for the development of certain of our drug candidates;•establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support clinical development and the market demand for our product candidates, if approved;•launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;•obtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;•addressing any competing technological and market developments;•negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter;•maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights; and•attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.Even if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate.
If we are unable to successfully license our other drug candidates, we may need to raise additional capital to finance the completion of theSteadfastStudy through equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.If the FDA or other regulators require that we perform additional studies beyond those we currently expect, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our drug candidates, our expenses could increase beyond what we currently anticipate and the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed.
If worldwide economic conditions and the international equity and credit markets deteriorate and return to depressed states, it will be more difficult for us to obtain additional equity or credit financing, when needed.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the progress, costs, results and timing of the STEADFAST Study, and the clinical development ofazeliragon;•the willingness of the FDA to accept the STEADFAST Study, as well as our other completed and planned clinical and preclinical studies and other work, as the basis for review and approval ofazeliragon;•the outcome, costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and any other regulatory approvals;•the number and characteristics of drug candidates that we pursue, including our drug candidates in preclinical development;•the ability of our drug candidates to progress through clinical development successfully;•our need to expand our research and development activities;•the costs associated with securing, establishing and maintaining commercialization capabilities;•the costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in businesses, products, drug candidates and technologies;•our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;•our need and ability to hire additional management and scientific and medical personnel;•the effect of competing technological and market developments;•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; and•the economic and other terms, timing and success of our existing licensing arrangements and any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future.Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, including purchasers of Class Acommon stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologiesor drug candidates.Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial revenue, we may finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements.
Our drug candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;•we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a drug candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;•the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;19TABLE OF CONTENTS•we may be unable to demonstrate that a drug candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;•the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the companion diagnostics we contemplate developing with partners; and•the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.This lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our drug candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our drug candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for our products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a drug candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that drug candidate.
The commencement, enrollment and completion of the STEADFAST Study or other clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:•inability to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;•regulatory objections to commencing a clinical trial;•inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our drug candidates;•withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;•inability to obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial;20TABLE OF CONTENTS•difficulty recruiting and enrolling subjects to participate in clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including willingness of subjects to undergo required study procedures, meeting the enrollment criteria for our study and competition from other clinical trial programs for the same indication as our drug candidates;•inability to retain subjects in clinical trials due to the treatment protocol, personal issues, side effects from the therapy or lack of efficacy; and•difficulty in importing and exporting clinical trial materials and study samples.Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.
The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty, including:•a collaboration partner may shift its priorities and resources away from our drug candidates due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing;•a collaboration partner may seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us due to unsatisfactory clinical results, manufacturing issues, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;•a collaboration partner may cease development in therapeutic areas which are the subject of our strategic collaboration;29TABLE OF CONTENTS•a collaboration partner may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our drug candidates;•a collaboration partner may change the success criteria for a drug candidate thereby delaying or ceasing development of such candidate;•a significant delay in initiation of certain development activities by a collaboration partner will also delay payment of milestones tied to such activities, thereby impacting our ability to fund our own activities;•a collaboration partner could develop a product that competes, either directly or indirectly, with our drug candidate;•a collaboration partner with commercialization obligations may not commit sufficient financial or human resources to the marketing, distribution or sale of a product;•a collaboration partner with manufacturing responsibilities may encounter regulatory, resource or quality issues and be unable to meet demand requirements;•a partner may exercise a contractual right to terminate a strategic alliance;•a dispute may arise between us and a partner concerning the research, development or commercialization of a drug candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of an alliance and possibly resulting in costly litigation or arbitration which may divert management attention and resources; and•a partner may use our products or technology in such a way as to invite litigation from a third party.For example, we previously licensed the development ofazeliragonto Pfizer Inc. in 2006, before Pfizer determined not to pursue the development of the program and we reacquiredazeliragonin 2011, and Forest Laboratories had previously licensed our GKA programs, includingTTP399, but decided to return the GKA programs to us in 2013, shortly before its acquisition by Actavis plc.
