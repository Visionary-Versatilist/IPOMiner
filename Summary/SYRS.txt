Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of SY-1425 and SY-1365;•research and preclinical development efforts for any future product candidates that we may develop;•our ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements;•the number of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;•the outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;•the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs
are not the responsibility of any future collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;•the costs of acquiring potential new product candidates or technology;15Table of Contents•the costs of any physician education programs relating to selecting and treating genomically defined patient populations;•the timing and amount of milestone and other payments due to licensors for patent and technology rights used in our development

failure to successfully initiate and complete clinical trials of our product candidates and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market
candidates that we develop may be identified during development and could delay or prevent their marketing approval or limit their use.Adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, SY-1425, SY-1365 or any future product
In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.Failure to successfully validate, develop and obtain regulatory approval for companion diagnostics
