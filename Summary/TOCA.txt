FC, we believe cytosine deaminase, or CD, as our therapeutic gene paired with 5-FC (5-fluorocytosine) is a promising choice for the following reasons:•CD is able to convert the anti-fungal drug, 5-FC, into the broadly applicable anti-cancer drug, 5-FU, in the cancer microenvironment;•CD provides additional anti-cancer selectivity, as humans do not have this gene;•the short half-life of 5-FU limits its direct killing to the localized area of the tumor micro-environment;•local 5-FU has powerful effects on increasing survival in immune competent animals after only a few cycles of5-FC;and•MDSCs and TAMS are very sensitive to 5-FU-mediated killing, which may reduce immune tolerance to the cancer.Our PipelineOur StrategyOur focus is to develop and commercialize first-in-class cancer-selective immunotherapies using our proprietary gene therapy platform.
We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.•The FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.•The FDA may disagree with our regulatory plans, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates.•We rely, and expect to continue to rely, in part, on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials and to manufacture our vectors, product candidates and other key materials.

Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:•completing clinical trials through all phases of clinical development of our current and future product candidates;•seeking and obtaining marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;•launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;•identifying and developing new product candidates;•progressing our preclinical programs into human clinical trials;•establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;13Table of Contents•maintaining, protecting, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property; and•attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.Because of the numerous risks and
beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, to perform studies and clinical trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate or if there are any delays in the development of any of our product
developments in clinical trials of gene therapy products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to change the requirements for performing studies or for obtaining approval of any of our product candidates.These regulatory review committees and advisory groups, and the new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process,
require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval
clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:•difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations, or CROs, and physicians;•different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;•our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and•the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatments.If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or
enrollment, other events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:•the availability of financial resources to commence and complete our planned clinical trials;•delays in reaching a consensus with clinical investigators on study design;•delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design or approval from regulatory authorities to commence a trial;•reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different clinical trial sites;•delays in obtaining required IRB and/or biologic safety committee approval at each clinical trial site;•imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies, after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or study sites, or otherwise;•failure by our CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical trial requirements;•failure to perform in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCP, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;•failure to adequately acquire, preserve and quality assure clinical trial data;•delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical sites;•inadequate shipping or storage of our products, resulting in loss of activity;•delays in having patients complete participation in a study or return for post-treatment follow-up;•clinical trial sites dropping out of a study;•changes in legislation or regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; and•technical equipment and/or operating room supply limitations at a clinical trial site.We

failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, if approved, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.Our reliance on third parties may require us to share our trade secrets, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or
product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:•differing regulatory requirements and reimbursement regimes in foreign countries;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;•difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•potential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;•challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.These and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain
