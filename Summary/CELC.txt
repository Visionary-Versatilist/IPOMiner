This coordination of commercialization strategies will allow us to significantly leverage the sales, marketing and reimbursement resources of our pharmaceutical partner, unlike traditional molecular diagnostic companies.We have a number of key strengths that enhance our ability to achieve our mission and build a successful company:•First mover.We are the first company we are aware of to launch diagnostic tests that measure the signaling pathway activity in a patient’s live tumor cells, which we believe gives us a significant first mover advantage.​•High barriers to entry.Our issued and pending patents, as well as our proprietary information and trade secrets give, us a strong intellectual property position that we believe creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors.​•Broad range of applications for our platform.We can develop tests for a wide range of signaling pathways and a wide range of cancer types.
This allows us to build a deep new product pipeline that creates multiple paths to build a large and profitable business.​•Multi-billion-dollar addressable market.The broad range of pathways and cancer tissues we can test with our CELx platform enables us to initially target up to approximately 880,000 cancer patients per year, creating a $3.5 billion addressable market for our CELx tests based on our expected selling price of at least $4,000 per test.​•Diverse revenue streams including pharma partnerships.We anticipate generating significant revenue from CDx pharmaceutical partners, including revenue from the sale of tests to identify patients eligible for clinical trials, milestone payments, and potentially, royalties on the incremental drug revenues our tests enable.
Some of these risks include:•we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate us, and we may never generate revenue or profit;​•our initial success is heavily dependent on the success of our CELx HSF Test;​•we have no ability to determine whether our CELx tests are currently commercially viable;​•we may not be successful in finding pharmaceutical company partners for continuing development of additional CELx tests;​•developing our CELx tests involves a lengthy and complex process that may not be successful;​•clinical trials are expensive and complex with uncertain outcomes, which may prevent or delay commercialization of our CELx tests;​•even if our CELx tests achieve positive clinical trial results, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success;​•our business, operational and financial goals may not be attainable if the market opportunities for our CELx tests or our pharmaceutical company partners are smaller than we expect;​•the actual price we are able to charge for our CELx tests may be substantially lower than our expected price range;​•the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of new diagnostic products is uncertain;​•we face significant competition from other diagnostic companies; and​•we may encounter difficulties in commercializing and marketing our products, or in managing growth.​​5TABLE OF CONTENTSImplicationsofBeinganEmergingGrowthCompanyAs a company with less than $1.0 billion of revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from the date of the first sale in this offering.
The degree of market acceptance of our CELx tests, will depend on a number of factors, including:•their efficacy and other potential advantages compared to alternative diagnostic tests;​•our ability to offer them for sale at competitive prices;​•their convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative diagnostics;​•the willingness of the target patient population to try new diagnostics and of physicians to initiate such diagnostics;​•the strength of marketing and distribution support;​•the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement for our diagnostic tests; and​•our ability partner with pharmaceutical companies to develop CDx programs for the new cancer sub-types we discover.​​14TABLE OF CONTENTSIf our CELx tests do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may never generate significant product revenues and we may not become profitable.Our business, operational and financial goals may not be attainable if the market opportunities for our CELx tests or our pharmaceutical company partners are smaller than we expect.
In addition, established medical technology, biotechnology and/or pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of diagnostic tests that could make our CELx tests less competitive.Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:•discover and develop CELx tests for cancer sub-types that are superior to other products in the market;​•demonstrate compelling advantages in the efficacy and convenience of our CELx tests on a cost competitive basis;​•attract qualified scientific, product development and commercial personnel;​•obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection as necessary for our CELx platform;​•obtain required U.S. and international regulatory approvals;​•successfully collaborate with research institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of our current and future CELx tests; and​•successfully expand our operations and build a sales force to support commercialization.​We may not be able to compete effectively if we are unable accomplish one or more of the these objectives.If our sole laboratory facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to perform our tests and our business will be harmed.We do not have redundant laboratory facilities.
