We intend to further develop G100 with local radiation in a Phase 1 trial for the treatment of patients with a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to commence in the second quarter of 2015.We recently released topline, qualitative data from these ongoing trials and have submitted abstracts for the trials to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and hope to have the opportunity to present data at the 2015 Annual Meeting later this year.4Table of ContentsThe Difference of Our Immuno-Oncology Product CandidatesWe have designed our product candidates to be different from current and traditional immuno-oncology products in the following ways:▪Focus on in vivo CTL generation because we believe they are the optimal mechanism for killing tumor cells.▪Select and administer tumor antigens effectively by delivering the antigen in the form of RNA directly to the DCs.▪Administer the therapy in vivo.▪Implement a prime-boost strategy to enhance CTL generation and trigger mechanisms to augment the immune response.▪Leverage combination therapies such as those with checkpoint inhibitors and other immuno-oncology approaches to provide significant therapeutic benefit.▪Cause antigen spreading from tumor lysis, leading to a second wave of diverse and targeted CTL generation.Our Strategy▪Develop product candidates to treat a broad patient population.▪Continue to rapidly advance first-in-class immuno-oncology product candidates through clinical development.▪Leverage our platforms’ ability to address multiple tumor types to build a robust product pipeline.▪Continue to selectively monetize non-oncology indications, while retaining optionality for internal development.▪Establish infrastructure and capabilities to support the future commercialization of our products.Risks Associated with Our BusinessOur ability to implement our business strategy is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.
These risks include, among others, the following:▪we had a net loss of $34.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, and an accumulated deficit of $90.8 million as of December 31, 2014, and we anticipate that we will incur net losses for the foreseeable future;▪our only source of revenue is from the sale of GLA and collaboration and licensing agreements and, as a result, we may never achieve or maintain profitability;▪we will require additional capital to finance our operations;▪our success is dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, all of which are novel and in early clinical development;▪if our product candidates fail to meet safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, they will not receive regulatory approval and we will be unable to market them;▪we are subject to regulatory approval processes that are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable and we may not obtain approval for any of our product candidates from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;▪our ZVex platform is novel, which may raise new regulatory issues that could delay or make regulatory approval of our ZVex product candidates more difficult;▪we may encounter delays in our clinical enrollment or other unforeseen challenges because the viral vector used in LV305 and CMB305 was constructed from genetic sequences, some of which were derived from HIV;▪termination of our licenses with the Infectious Disease Research Institute, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the California Institute of Technology would result in our losing rights to critical patents, including GLA patents, and our ability to commercialize our product candidates relating to the underlying patents;▪manufacturers have limited or no experience producing our product candidates and may not produce our vectors and product candidates at the quality, quantities, locations and timing needed to support clinical trials or commercialization;▪we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, including the patents related to GLA, which we license from the Infectious Disease Research Institute, and patents related to our ZVex-based product candidates, which we license from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the California Institute of Technology;▪we may be unable to recruit or retain key employees, particularly those with experience in immuno-oncology, including our executive officers; and5Table of Contents▪we depend on the performance of third parties, including contract research organizations and third-party manufacturers, including the manufacturer of ZVex.Our Corporate InformationWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in February 2008.
Our ability to generate significant product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including but not limited to our ability to:▪successfully complete the research and clinical development of and receive regulatory approval for current and future product candidates, including those of our licensees for the use of GLA in specific indications;▪launch, commercialize and achieve market acceptance of our current and future product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, if any, and if launched independently, successfully establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure;▪establish and maintain supplier and manufacturing relationships with third parties, and ensure adequate and legally compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain that supply;▪obtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;▪establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights; and▪attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.In addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biotechnology product development, including that our product candidates may not achieve the clinical endpoints of applicable trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, and if or when we will achieve or maintain profitability.
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:▪the scope, rate of progress, results and costs of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other research and development activities;▪the scope, rate of progress and costs of our manufacturing development and commercial manufacturing activities;▪the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory proceedings, including FDA review of any Biologics License Application, or BLA, we file;▪payments required with respect to development milestones we achieve under our in-licensing agreements;▪the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;▪the costs associated with commercializing our product candidates, if they receive regulatory approval;▪the cost and timing of developing our ability to establish sales and marketing capabilities;▪the costs of current or future litigation or judgments;▪competing technological efforts and market developments;▪changes in our existing research relationships;▪our ability to establish collaborative arrangements to the extent necessary;▪revenues received from any existing or future products; and▪payments received under any current or future strategic partnerships.We anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to complete our clinical trial programs for our product candidates, build commercial capabilities, develop our product pipeline and expand our corporate infrastructure.
Our current and future clinical trials may be delayed or terminated as a result of many factors, including:▪efforts by TVS to slow down our clinical development, including through the entry of a permanent injunction or other equitable relief by the Chancery Court of Delaware after a trial on the merits in our ongoing litigation with TVS;▪delays in, or failure to obtain, approval from institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees, or ECs, or institutional biosafety committees, to begin clinical trials at study sites;▪imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or a decision by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, IRBs, ECs, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;▪delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;▪deviations from the trial protocol by clinical trial sites and investigators, or failure to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;▪failure of third parties, such as CROs, to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;▪delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates to the clinical sites;▪for clinical trials in selected patient populations, delays in identification and auditing of central or other laboratories and the transfer and validation of assays or tests to be used to identify selected patients;▪delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;▪delays caused by patients dropping out of a trial due to side effects, disease progression or other reasons;▪slow patient enrollment because of the perceived risk of contracting HIV because the viral vector we use in LV305 and CMB305 was constructed from genetic sequences, some of which were derived from HIV;▪withdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials; or▪changes in government regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trials.Any inability of us or our partners to timely complete clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate product revenues or development, regulatory, commercialization and sales milestone payments and royalties on product sales.If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical trials could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.We may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients or those with required or desired characteristics to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner.
Patient enrollment is affected by factors including:▪the nature and size of the patient population;▪the number and location of clinical sites we enroll;▪competition with other companies for clinical sites or patients;14Table of Contents▪design of the trial protocol;▪eligibility criteria for the study in question;▪slow patient enrollment because of the perceived risk of contracting HIV because the viral vector we use in LV305 and CMB305 was constructed from genetic sequences, some of which were derived from HIV;▪ability to obtain and maintain patient consents; and▪clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, either of which would have an adverse effect on our business.Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial scope of their approved uses, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.
Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish new development collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such development collaborations if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product candidate are disappointing.Moreover, if we fail to establish and maintain additional development collaborations related to our product candidates:▪the development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;▪our cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates would increase significantly, and we may need to seek additional financing;▪we may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted; and▪we will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.If we enter into one or more collaborations, we may be required to relinquish important rights to and control over the development of our product candidates or otherwise be subject to unfavorable terms.Any future collaborations we enter into could subject us to a number of risks, including:▪we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators devote to the development or commercialization of our product candidates;▪collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding, terminate a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new version of a product candidate for clinical testing;▪collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from the strategic partnering arrangement or may elect to discontinue research and development programs;▪collaborators may not commit adequate resources to the marketing and distribution of our product candidates, limiting our potential revenues from these products;▪disputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management’s attention and consumes resources;▪collaborators may experience financial difficulties;▪collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in a manner that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;▪business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator’s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator’s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;▪collaborators could decide to move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; and▪collaborators could terminate the arrangement or allow it to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates.We have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on third-party manufacturers for the development and commercialization of our products.We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our product candidates.
