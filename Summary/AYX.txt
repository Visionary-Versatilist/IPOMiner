Our operating results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which are unpredictable or are outside of our control, including:•our ability to generate significant revenue from new products and services;•our ability to maintain and grow our customer base;•our ability to expand our number of partners and distribution of our platform;•the development and introduction of new products and services by us or our competitors;•increases in and timing of operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;•seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers;•the timing of our Inspire customer conferences;•costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies, or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs;•failures or breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with remediating any such failures or breaches;•adverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, such as with respect to privacy;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies; and•general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets.We have been growing rapidly and expect

If this occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.Our platform may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties and this may create liability for us or otherwise harm our business.Third parties may claim that our current or future products and services infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may result in legal

These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which we
