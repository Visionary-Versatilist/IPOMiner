If the volume of sales of these products declines, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Furthermore, we believe spine surgeons will not widely adopt our disruptive technology products unless they determine, based on
Surgeons may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:•lack of experience with MIS or our motion preservation or advanced biomaterials technologies;•lack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;•perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;•limited or lack of availability of coverage and reimbursement within healthcare payment systems;•costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment; and•the time commitment that may be required for training.15Table of ContentsWe have also recently implemented plans to begin selling our existing and planned
physicians successfully, we will not achieve expected sales, and our financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected.In addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential spine surgeons are essential for market acceptance and adoption.
These competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:•greater financial, human and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing and litigation;•significantly greater name recognition;•established relationships with spine surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers;•large and established sales and marketing and distribution networks;•products supported by long-term clinical data;•greater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances or approvals for products and product enhancements;•more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights; and•greater ability to cross-sell their products or to incentivize hospitals or surgeons to use their products.The spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new participants.

Our international operations expose us and our independent distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions, including:•exposure to different legal and regulatory standards;•lack of stringent protection of intellectual property;•obstacles to obtaining domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses and compliance with foreign laws;•potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems;•adverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions;•limitations on the repatriation of earnings;•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;•transportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels;23Table of Contents•longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;•increased financing costs; and•political, social and economic instability and increased security concerns.These risks may limit or disrupt our expansion, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair
Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including:•problems assimilating the purchased technologies, products or business operations;•issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;•unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;•diversion of management’s attention from our core business;•adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;•potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and•increased legal and accounting compliance costs.We have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment.
adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.26Table of ContentsRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory EnvironmentOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation both in the United States and abroad, and our failure
of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.Outside the United States, our products and operations are also often required to comply with standards set by industrial standards bodies, such as the International Organization for Standardization, or

Our sales and results of operations will be affected by numerous factors, including:•our ability to drive increased sales of our products;•our ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales force;•pricing pressure applicable to our products, including adverse third-party coverage and reimbursement outcomes;•results of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;•the mix of our products sold because profit margins differ amongst our products;•timing of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;•the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of materials and components;•the evolving product offerings of our competitors;•regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;•interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;38Table of Contents•the effect of competing technological, industry and market developments;•changes in our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products; and•our ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts.Many of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require FDA approval or clearance before commercialization
Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the revenues generated by sales of our products;•the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;•the expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;•the costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;•the cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of our products and products in development;•the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions;•the costs associated with our planned international expansion;•the costs associated with increased capital expenditures, including fixed asset purchases of instrument sets which we loan to hospitals to support
