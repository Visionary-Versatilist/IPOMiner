community offering.Reasons for the Offering (page _____)Our primary reasons for this offering are to:•increase the capital of East Boston Savings Bank to   support future lending and operational growth;•enhance profitability and earnings through investing   and leveraging the proceeds;•enable us to increase lending limits and support our   emphasis on commercial real estate, construction and commercial business   loans;•support future branching activities and/or the   acquisition of financial services companies or their assets; and•implement equity compensation plans to retain and   attract qualified directors, officers and staff and to enhance our current   incentive based compensation programs.As part of our business planning process, our board of directors concluded that additional capital was needed in order to increase our profitability and support asset growth and that the best way to accomplish this would be through a stock offering.
We chose not to sell more than 43.7% of our shares to the public so that we would have shares to contribute to the charitable foundation and have the flexibility to issue authorized but unissued shares to fund future stock benefit plans, in each case without exceeding the regulatory limit on the percentage of shares that can be owned by persons other than Meridian Financial Services.We will also be able to increase our philanthropic endeavors to the communities we serve through the contribution to Meridian Charitable Foundation.Purchase PriceThe purchase price is $10.00 per share.

Keller & Company also considered the following factors, among others:•our historical, present and projected operating   results and financial condition and the economic and demographic   characteristics of our market area;•a comparative evaluation of the operating and   financial statistics of East Boston Savings Bank with those of other   similarly-situated, publicly-traded savings banks and bank holding companies;•the effect of the capital raised in this offering on   our net worth and earnings potential;4•the trading market for securities of comparable   institutions and general conditions in the market for such securities; and•our intention to make a contribution to Meridian   Charitable Foundation of 300,000 shares of our common stock.Our board of directors determined that the common stock should be sold at $10.00 per share and that 43.7% of the shares of our common stock should be offered for sale to the public in the offering.

Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Operating Strategy.”Changes in interest rates could hurt our profits.Our profitability, like most financial institutions, depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between our interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and our interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds.
This ability to make larger loans may expose us to greater risk of loss.Our business strategy includes the continuation of significant growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.Our assets
Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.A downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could hurt our profits.Unlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, our profitability depends on the general economic conditions in the Boston metropolitan area.
Pro forma benefits expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.9 million (tax effected) at the maximum of the offering range, as set forth in the pro forma financial information under “Pro Forma Data” assuming the $10.00 per share purchase price as fair market value.
Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors:•general economic conditions, either nationally or in   our market area, that are worse than expected;•changes in the interest rate environment that reduce   our interest margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;•increased competitive pressures among financial services   companies;•changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings   habits;•legislative or regulatory changes that adversely   affect our business;•adverse changes in the securities markets; and•changes in accounting policies and practices, as may   be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting   Standards Board or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.21Any of the forward-looking statements that we make in this prospectus and in other public statements we make may later prove incorrect because of inaccurate assumptions we might make, the factors illustrated above or other factors that we cannot foresee.
