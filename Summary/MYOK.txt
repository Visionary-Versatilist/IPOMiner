prior to December 31, 2016, we will not receive additional funding from this relationship and may not be able to successfully commercialize certain product candidates, including MYK-461;•If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient intellectual property protection for our product candidates or our platform technology, we may not be able to compete effectively;•Even if this offering is successful, we will need to raise additional funding before we can expect to complete the development of any of our product candidates or generate any revenue from product sales; and•Our success depends in part upon our ability to retain our key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate other qualified personnel.Implications of Being an Emerging Growth CompanyWe qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS

believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.Our funding requirements and the timing of our need for additional capital are subject to change based on a number of factors, including:•the rate of progress and the cost of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of MYK-461 and any future clinical trials of MYK-491;•whether Sanofi determines to terminate or continue with our collaboration, which decision will come prior to December 31, 2016, and, as a result, whether we will receive any additional funding pursuant to the
Collaboration Agreement and timing thereof;•the number of product candidates that we intend to develop using our precision medicine platform;•the costs of research and preclinical studies, including our IND-enabling studies for MYK-491, to support the advancement of additional product candidates into clinical development;•the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities to require that
we perform more studies than those that we current expect;•the costs of preparing to manufacture MYK-461 on a larger scale, and to manufacture MYK-491 for clinical development;•the costs of commercialization activities if MYK-461 or any future product candidate is approved, including the formation of a sales force;•the degree and rate of market acceptance of any products launched by us or our partners;•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;•our need and ability to hire additional personnel;•our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and•the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.Any additional

one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.Preclinical and clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and observations and results from earlier
