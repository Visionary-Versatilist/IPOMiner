We believe CR845-based products, if approved, have the potential to be attractive for patients with moderate-to-severe pain and their physicians due to the following attributes:•novel, peripherally-acting, kappa opioid receptor mechanism of action;•strong evidence of efficacy;•potential for reducing opioid use and mu opioid-related adverse events such as nausea and vomiting;•avoidance of mu opioid-related CNS side effects, such as respiratory depression and euphoria;•absence of euphoria which lowers addiction or abuse potential;•avoidance of drug-drug interactions; and•availability in I.V. form for acute pain treatment in the hospital setting and oral form for treatment of acute and chronic pain in either a

increase substantially as we:•commence our planned Phase 3 and other trials for I.V. CR845;•initiate and enroll our Phase 1 clinical trials of Oral CR845;•discover and develop additional product candidates;•conduct late-stage clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete early clinical trials;•increase our I.V. CR845 manufacturing batch sizes to satisfy FDA requirements for Phase 3 clinical trials and a New Drug Application, or NDA,
which we may obtain regulatory approval and that we choose not to license to a third party;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned
commercialization of I.V. CR845 and our other future product candidates, if approved by the FDA;•qualify and outsource the commercial-scale manufacturing of our products under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;•advance Oral CR845 beyond Phase 2 clinical trials;•develop additional product candidates, including CR701; and•in-license other product candidates.We believe that with our available cash and cash equivalent balance as of September 30, 2013, along with the net proceeds
not limited to:•the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for I.V. CR845, and any costs associated with such delays;•the costs of establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute I.V. CR845;•the rate of progress and costs related to our Phase 1 and Phase 2 development of Oral CR845;•the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of an NDA for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire
in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product
candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;•the cost and timing of manufacturing sufficient supplies of I.V. CR845 in preparation for commercialization;•the effect of competing technological and market developments;•the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish;•defending our intellectual property and patent rights; and•the success of the commercialization of I.V. CR845 and our other product candidates.12Table of ContentsFuture capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or
products, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.Our lead product candidate, I.V. CR845, will require additional clinical development, regulatory approval, commercial manufacturing arrangements, establishment of a commercial organization, significant marketing efforts and further investment before we generate any revenues from
approval;•maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for I.V. CR845;•launch commercial sales of I.V. CR845, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•achieve market acceptance of I.V. CR845 by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;13Table of Contents•achieve appropriate reimbursement for I.V. CR845;•effectively compete with other therapies; and•maintain a continued acceptable safety profile of I.V. CR845 following launch.As we continue to develop our other product candidates, including Oral CR845 and CR701, we expect to face similar risks to our
If we do not successfully develop and commercialize product candidates, we may not be able to obtain product revenues in future periods.The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and
including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;•changes in marketing approval policies during the development period;•changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations;•changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application;•the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;•the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be
tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:•be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;•not obtain marketing approval at all;•obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;•obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;•be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; or•have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.Furthermore, regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any
commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.If any of our product candidates are classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors,
manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:•restrictions on manufacturing such products;•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;20Table of Contents•restrictions on product distribution or use;•requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;•warning letters;•withdrawal of the products from the market;•refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;•recall of products;•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;•suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;•product seizure; or•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay
