If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for birinapant may be adversely impacted.The therapeutic efficacy of birinapant is unproven in humans, and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize birinapant pursuant to these programs.Birinapant is a novel compound and its potential benefit as a therapeutic cancer or antiviral drug is unproven.

products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.If we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell birinapant, we may be unable to generate any
a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize birinapant.
Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, for example:•decreased demand for birinapant;•termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;•injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;28Table of Contents•withdrawal of clinical trial subjects;•significant costs to defend the related litigation;•substantial monetary awards to clinical trial subjects or patients;•loss of revenue;•diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;•the inability to commercialize birinapant; and•increased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the HHS,
