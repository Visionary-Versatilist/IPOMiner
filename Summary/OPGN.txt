If we are unable to make such investments our business will suffer.5·We are an early stage company with a history of losses, and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.·Our products and services may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.·Our future success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base.·We depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.·The healthcare industry is highly regulated by both federal and state governments, and our compliance with laws and regulations, which are often changing, is critical to our success·We face competition from large, well-capitalized companies which are developing rapid diagnostic systems for MDROs. If we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.6THE OFFERINGUnits offered by us in this offering:1,694,915 units, each consisting of one share of our common stock and one common warrant to purchase 0.5 of a share of our common stockPre-funded units offered by us in this offering:We are also offering to each purchaser whose purchase of units in this offering would otherwise result in the purchaser, together with its affiliates and certain related parties, beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our outstanding common stock immediately following the consummation of this offering, the opportunity to purchase, if the purchaser so chooses, pre-funded units (each pre-funded unit consisting of one pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of our common stock and one common warrant to purchase 0.5 of a share of our common stock) in lieu of units that would otherwise result in the purchaser's beneficial ownership exceeding 4.99% of our outstanding common stock (or, at the election of the purchaser, 9.99%).

The market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as :·our ability to grow our revenue and customer base;·the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;·developments concerning regulatory oversight and approvals;·variations in our and our competitors' results of operations;·changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our common stock is covered by analysts;·successes or challenges in our collaborative arrangements or alternative funding sources;·developments in the health care and life science industries;·the results of product liability or intellectual property lawsuits;·future issuances of common stock or other securities;·the addition or departure of key personnel;·announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances; and·general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.Further, the stock market in general, and the market for health care and life science companies in particular, has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations.
The failure to obtain sufficient capital to support our operations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.With financing, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses relating to, among other things:·developing our Acuitas Rapid Test products and services for antibiotic resistance testing, and our automated rapid molecular diagnostic products;·commercializing our rapid pathogen identification and Acuitas MDRO and Acuitas Lighthouse informatics services;·developing, presenting and publishing additional clinical and economic utility data intended to increase clinician adoption of our current and future products and services;·expansion of our operating capabilities;·maintenance, expansion and protection of our intellectual property portfolio and trade secrets;·future clinical trials as we seek regulatory approval for some of our product offerings;·expansion of the size and geographic reach of our sales force and our marketing capabilities to commercialize potential future products and services; and·continued focus on recruiting and retaining our quality assurance and compliance personnel and activities.Even if we achieve significant revenues, we may not become profitable, and even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.
Our relationships with future collaborators may pose several risks, including the following:·collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;·collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;·we may not achieve any milestones, or receive any milestone payments, under our collaborations, including milestones and/or payments that we expect to achieve or receive;·the clinical trials, if any, conducted as part of these collaborations may not be successful;·a collaborator might elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator's strategic focus or available funding or external factors, such as an acquisition, that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;·we may not have access to, or may be restricted from disclosing, certain information regarding product or services candidates being developed or commercialized under a collaboration and, consequently, may have limited ability to inform our stockholders about the status of such product or services candidates;·collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;18·product or services candidates developed in collaboration with us may be viewed by our collaborators as competitive with their own product or services, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product or services candidates;·a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product or services candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product candidate;·disagreements with collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development of any product or services candidates, may cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of such product or services candidates, may lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such product or services candidates or may result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;·collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;·disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of intellectual property developed pursuant to a collaboration;·collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and·collaborations may be terminated for the convenience of the collaborator and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product or services candidates.If our future collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products or services, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaborations.
If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure we may make, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.Risks Related to Regulation of Our BusinessIf we fail to comply with federal, state and foreign laboratory licensing requirements, we could lose the ability to perform our tests or experience disruptions to our business.We are subject to CLIA for our Acuitas MDRO tests, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease.
