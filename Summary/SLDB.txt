expenses will increase substantially if, and as, we:•conduct our clinical trials ofSGT-001;•continue research and preclinical development of our other product candidates;•seek to identify additional product candidates;•seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;•arrange for manufacture of larger quantities of our product candidates for clinical development and potential commercialization;•maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio;•hire and retain additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;•build out new facilities or expand existing facilities to support our ongoing development activity;•acquire orin-licenseother drugs, technologies and intellectual property; and•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel.To become and
fund our current operating plans through at least the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will need additional funding to complete the development ofSGT-001and our other product candidates.Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the progress and results of our current and future clinical trials ofSGT-001and our other product candidates;•the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review ofSGT-001and our other product candidates;•the scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, laboratory testing, manufacturing, preclinical development and clinical trials for other product candidates that we may pursue in the future, if any;•the costs associated with our manufacturing process development and evaluation of third-party manufacturers;•the costs associated with constructing and validating our own manufacturing facility;•revenue, if any, received from commercial sale ofSGT-001or our other product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval;•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;•the terms of our current and any future license agreements and collaborations; and•the extent to which we acquire orin-licenseother product candidates, technologies and intellectual property.Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain

Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:•delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;•delays in successfully addressing the specific deficiencies raised by the FDA with respect to the partial clinical hold placed on our Phase I/II clinical trial for SGT-001;•delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;•delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;20Table of Contents•delays in recruiting suitable subjects to participate in our clinical trials, including because such trials may be placebo-controlled trials and patients are not guaranteed to receive treatment with our product
contracted to perform certain of those functions;•delays in subjects completing participation in a trial or returning for post-treatmentfollow-up;•clinical trial sites or subjects dropping out of a trial;•selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;•imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations, trial sites or manufacturing facilities;•occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; or•changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.Additionally, if the results of any clinical trials are inconclusive or if there are safety concerns or serious adverse events associated withSGT-001or our other product candidates, we may:•be delayed or fail in obtaining marketing approval forSGT-001or our other product candidates;•obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as we intended or desired;•obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;•be subject to changes in the way the products are administered;•be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;•have regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified REMS;•be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or•experience damage to our reputation.Our product development costs will increase if we
is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:•different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;•absence in some countries of established groups with sufficient regulatory expertise for review of gene therapy protocols;•difficulty in identifying and partnering with qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and•the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology research and products.Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercializeSGT-001or our other product candidates and the approval may be for a more narrow indication than we seek.We cannot commercializeSGT-001or our other product candidates until the appropriate regulatory
degree of market acceptance of gene therapy products and, in particular,SGT-001,if approved for commercial sale, will depend on multiple factors, including:•the efficacy and safety ofSGT-001as demonstrated in clinical trials;•the efficacy and potential and perceived advantages ofSGT-001over alternative treatments;•the cost of treatment relative to alternative treatments;•the clinical indications for whichSGT-001is approved by the FDA or the European Commission;•the willingness of physicians to prescribe new therapies;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;•relative convenience and ease of administration;•the strength of marketing and distribution support;•the timing of market introduction of competitive products;•the availability of products to meet market demand;•publicity concerning our product candidates or competing products and treatments;•any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications; and•favorable third-party payor coverage and adequate reimbursement.Even if a potential product displays a
