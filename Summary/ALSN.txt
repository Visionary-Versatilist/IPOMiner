We also have royalty agreements with third parties that provide net sales as a result of joint efforts in developing marketable products.45Table of ContentsCost of salesOur most significant components of cost of sales are purchased parts, the overhead expense related to our manufacturing operations and
actual and expected returns on assets during a year and actuarial gains and losses on liabilities together with any prior service costs are charged (or credited) to income over the average remaining service lives of employees.The benefit cost components shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are based upon certain data specific to our company,
stock based on an analysis of relevant factors, including the following:•our historical and projected operating and financial performance;•observed market multiples for comparable businesses;•the uncertainty in our business associated with uncertain economic conditions;•the fact that the option grants involve illiquid securities in a private company; and•the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company.In October 2007, we granted equity instruments for the first time at a fair market value based upon the price paid in the Acquisition
Committee determined that the fair market value of our common stock underlying option grants, derived based on historic multiples and the price paid for the Acquisition Transaction, had either declined or not increased above the share price paid in
value to the shares due to, among other things, increased liquidity and marketability; however, the extent (if any) of such additional value cannot be measured with precision or certainty and the shares could suffer a decrease in value.Results of OperationsThe following table sets forth certain financial information for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and should be
