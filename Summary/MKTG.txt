risk factors listed in this section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:•demand for our software and related services and the size and timing of sales;•the volume of email messages sent above contracted levels for a particular quarter and the amount of any associated additional charges;•customer renewal rates, and the pricing and volume commitments at which agreements are renewed;•customers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;•market acceptance of our current and future products and services;•changes in spending on interactive marketing or information technology and software by our current and/or prospective customers;•budgeting cycles of our customers;•changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or customers;•our lengthy sales cycle;•lengthy or delayed implementation times for new customers or customers that upgrade to our current platform;•the timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter as a result of revenue recognition rules;•the amount of services sold and the amount of fixed fee services, which can affect gross margin;•our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;•the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and

In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our services.A limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of a major customer or group of customers could harm our operating results.Our 20 largest customers accounted for approximately 35.1% and 37.0% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010,
Although we do not currently derive a significant amount of revenue through third parties, we may in the future seek to expand sales of subscriptions to our on-demand software through these and other indirect sales channels.These third parties may offer customers the solutions of several different companies, including solutions that compete with
senders of commercial emails and text messages, which could minimize the effectiveness of our on-demand software or increase our operating expenses to the extent financial penalties are triggered.The Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or the CAN-SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements
