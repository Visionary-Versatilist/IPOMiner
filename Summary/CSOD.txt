clients may elect to decrease their information technology and learning and talent management budgets by deferring or reconsidering product purchases, which would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results.Our financial results may fluctuate due to our long, variable and, therefore, unpredictable sales cycle and our focus on large and mid-market
variability of our sales cycle include:Ÿthe need to educate potential clients about the uses and benefits of our solution;Ÿthe relatively long duration of the commitment clients make in their agreements with us;Ÿthe discretionary nature of potential clients’ purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;Ÿthe competitive nature of potential clients’ evaluation and purchasing processes;Ÿevolving functionality demands of potential clients;Ÿfluctuations in the learning and talent management needs of potential clients;Ÿannouncements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors; andŸlengthy purchasing approval processes of potential clients.The fluctuations that result from the length and variability of our sales cycle may be magnified by our focus on sales to large and mid-sized organizations.
fluctuate from period to period, including:Ÿthe extent to which new clients are attracted to our solution to satisfy their learning and talent management needs;Ÿthe timing and rate at which we sign agreements with new clients;Ÿthe extent to which we retain existing clients and satisfy their requirements;Ÿthe extent to which existing clients renew their subscriptions to our solution and the timing of those renewals;Ÿthe extent to which existing clients purchase or discontinue use of additional platforms in our solution and add or decrease the number of users;Ÿthe addition or loss of large clients, including through acquisitions or consolidations;Ÿthe number and size of new clients, as compared to the number and size of renewal clients in a particular period;Ÿthe mix of clients between small, mid-sized and large organizations;Ÿchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;Ÿchanges in billing cycles and the size of advance payments relative to overall contract value in client agreements;Ÿseasonal factors affecting demand for our solution or potential clients purchasing decisions;Ÿthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our clients;Ÿthe amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;10Table of ContentsŸthe timing and success of new product and service introductions by us;Ÿthe timing and success of current and new competitive products and services by our competitors;Ÿother changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, clients or strategic partners;Ÿthe timing of expenses related to the development of new products and technologies, including enhancements to our solution;Ÿour ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including in terms of additional clients, incremental users and new geographic regions;Ÿexpenses related to our data centers and the expansion of such data centers;Ÿthe effects and expenses of acquisition of third-party technologies or businesses and any potential future charges for impairment of goodwill resulting from
If our clients do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, fail to purchase additional platforms, or fail to add new users, our revenue may decline, and our operating results may be harmed.11Table of ContentsThe market in which we participate is intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our

We may also not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:Ÿunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;Ÿincurrence of acquisition-related costs;Ÿdiversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;Ÿharm to our existing relationships with distributors and clients as a result of the acquisition;Ÿthe potential loss of key employees;Ÿthe use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; andŸthe use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets,
unable to achieve expected productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to significantly increase our revenue and grow our business.If we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel, our business could be harmed.We believe that our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees, such as our chief executive officer.
