We also believe our solar cells provide the following benefits compared with conventional solar cells:•Superior performance, including the ability to generate up to 50% more power per unit area;•Superior aesthetics, with our uniformly black surface design which eliminates highly visible reflective grid lines and metal interconnect ribbons; and•Efficient use of silicon, a key raw material used in the manufacture of solar cells.We offer solar power products, including solar cells, solar panels and inverters, which convert sunlight to electricity
supply-chain opportunities, increase the efficiency of the downstream channel and reduce the cost of products delivered to end customers.Our Corporate HistoryWe were incorporated in 1985 by Dr. Richard Swanson to develop and commercialize high-efficiency photovoltaic, or solar, cell technology.

product performance, including defects, in our solar cells could result in a decrease in customers and revenue, unexpected expenses and loss of market share.Our solar cells are complex and must meet stringent quality requirements.
our imaging detectors are lengthy for a number of reasons, including:•our customers usually complete an in-depth technical evaluation of our imaging detectors before they place a purchase order;•the commercial adoption of our imaging detectors is typically limited during the initial release of their products to evaluate performance and consumer demand;•failure to deliver a product in a timely manner can seriously delay or cancel introduction; and•the development and commercial introduction of products incorporating complex technology frequently are delayed or canceled.As a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur substantial expenses
before we earn associated revenue because a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed and based on expected revenue.If customer cancellations or product changes occur, this could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our
