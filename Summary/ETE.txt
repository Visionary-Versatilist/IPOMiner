partners, including us, each quarter principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the amount of natural gas transported in its pipelines and gathering systems;•the throughput volumes in its natural gas processing and treating facilities;•the fees it charges and the margins it realizes for its services;•prices of natural gas and propane;•relationships among crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;•weather conditions;•the level of its operating costs, including reimbursements to its general partner; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash that ETP will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level of capital expenditures it makes;•the sources of cash used to fund its acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and restrictions contained in its obligations for borrowed money;•fluctuations in its working capital needs; and•the amount of cash reserves established by Energy Transfer Partners GP for the proper conduct of ETP’s business.Because of these factors, ETP may not have sufficient available cash each
amount of such increased or decreased distributions, if any, will not necessarily be comparable to the timing and amount of the increase or decrease in distributions made by ETP to us.Our ability to distribute cash received from ETP to our unitholders is limited by a number of factors, including:•interest expense and principal payments on our indebtedness;•restrictions on distributions contained in any current or future debt agreements;•our general and administrative expenses, including expenses we will incur as the result of being a public company;•expenses of our subsidiaries other than ETP, including tax liabilities of our corporate subsidiaries, if any;•capital contributions to maintain our 2% general partner interest in ETP as required by the partnership agreement of ETP upon the issuance of additional partnership securities by
completion of this offering, affiliates of our general partner will own approximately 74.2% of our common and Class B units, a sufficient number to change our cash distribution policy, amend a majority of the provisions of our partnership agreement
The following factors could affect our unit price:•ETP’s operating and financial performance and prospects;•quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as distributable cash flow per unit, net income and revenues;•changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;•speculation by the press or investment community;•sales of our common units by our unitholders;•actions by our existing unitholders prior to their disposition of our common units;•announcements by ETP or its competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, securities offerings or capital commitments;•general market conditions; and•domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors related to ETP’s performance.The equity markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance
