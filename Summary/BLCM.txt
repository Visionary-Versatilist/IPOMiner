We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.nWe have concentrated our therapeutic product research and development efforts on our CID platform, a novel therapeutic approach, and our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach.nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our CID platform to build a pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.nThe FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.
Coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
These provisions include, but are not limited to:nbeing permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this prospectus;nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; andnexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.We may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this offering.
