We have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.nWe have concentrated our therapeutic product research and development efforts on our CID platform, a novel therapeutic approach, and our future success depends on the successful development of this therapeutic approach.nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.nWe may not be successful in our efforts to use and expand our CID platform to build a pipeline of product candidates and develop marketable products.nThe FDA regulatory approval process is lengthy and time-consuming, and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval of our product candidates.
Coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, which could make it difficult for us to sell our product candidates profitably.nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
These provisions include, but are not limited to:nbeing permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this prospectus;nnot being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended;nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; andnexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.We may use these provisions until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the closing of this offering.

Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:ncompleting clinical trials through all phases of clinical development of our current product candidates, as well as the product candidates that are being developed by our partners and licensees;nseeking and obtaining marketing approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;nlaunching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, with a partner or, if launched independently, successfully establishing a sales force, marketing and distribution infrastructure;nidentifying and developing new product candidates;nprogressing our pre-clinical programs into human clinical trials;nestablishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties;ndeveloping new molecular switches based on our proprietary CID technology platform;nmaintaining, protecting, expanding and enforcing our intellectual property; andnattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.12Table of ContentsBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biologic product development, we are unable to predict the

As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.Switching or adding third parties to conduct our clinical trials involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus.
As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.Additionally, we are conducting multiple clinical trials in Europe and may plan additional testing of our technology and product candidates in other foreign
other regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidate or require us to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to marketing approval, which would increase our costs.
our clinical trials may increase if the FDA does not agree with our clinical development plans or requires us to conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation.
