Our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We have granted sales representation rights to an affiliated company, which restricts our distribution.Our affiliates American DG Energy and EuroSite Power Inc. have certain exclusive sales representation rights to our cogeneration products only (not including chillers) and exclusive rights to our Ultra low-emissions technology if it is applied to engines from other CHP manufacturers in projects developed by American DG Energy (see “The Company and Its Affiliates” in the “Business” section of this preliminary prospectus).
Also, potential customers may perceive the unpredictable swings in natural gas and electricity prices as an increased risk of investing in on-site CHP, and may decide not to purchase CHP products.We are exposed to credit risks with respect to some of our customers.To the extent our customers do not advance us sufficient funds to finance our costs during the execution phase of our contracts, we are exposed to the risk that they will be unable to accept delivery or that they will be unable to make payment at the time of delivery.We may make acquisitions that could harm our financial performance.To expedite development of our corporate infrastructure, particularly with regard to equipment installation and service functions, we anticipate the future acquisition of complementary businesses.
The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their Common Stock, which might affect the prevailing market price for our Common Stock.Further, if John Hatsopoulos or George Hatsopoulos were to sell a substantial portion of their shares in the Company, it may have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company, and substantial sales of their Common Stock may result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock.There has been a material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.As of our fiscal year end, December 31, 2013, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer performed an evaluation of controls and procedures and concluded that our controls were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by our Company in reports that we file under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as when required.
We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.We are and we will remain an “emerging growth company”, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a large accelerated filer under the Exchange Act.For so long as we remain an emerging growth company we are not required to:•have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;•comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);•submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder non-binding advisory votes;•submit for shareholder approval golden parachute payments not previously approved; and•disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and financial performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation to median employee compensation, when such disclosure requirements are adopted.In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
All of the shares sold in this offering will be held by the selling stockholders at the time of the sale, so that no dilution will result from the sale of the shares.CAPITALIZATIONThe following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of March 31, 2014:•on an actual basis;You should read this table in conjunction with the sections titled “Selected Consolidated Financial Data” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.March 31, 2014(unaudited)December 31, 2013(audited)Cash and cash equivalents$1,946,891$7,713,899Short term investments583,720—Convertible Debentures3,000,0003,000,000Demand notes payable—2,950,000Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share - 100,000,000 shares authorized; 15,155,200 issued shares, actual; and 15,156,600 issued shares;15,16215,155Additional paid-in capital22,508,01322,463,996Accumulated deficit(16,229,257)(15,209,212)Noncontrolling interest(262,439)(204,046)Total shareholders’ equity$6,031,479$7,065,893Total capitalization$6,031,479$7,065,893May 31, 2014(unaudited)Cash and cash equivalents$3,686,959Short term investments583,720Convertible Debentures3,000,00015Table of ContentsBUSINESSOverviewTecogen designs, manufactures, sells, and services systems that produce electricity, hot water, and air conditioning for commercial installations and buildings and industrial processes.
These include the Ultra low-emissions technology, sponsored by the California Energy Commission and Southern California Gas Company, and new 35-kW engine technology we developed with the California Energy Commission’s support.Pursuant to the terms of the grants from the California Energy Commission, the California Energy Commission has a royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive license to these technologies, for government purposes.For the years endedDecember 31, 2013and2012, we spent approximately$866,700and $384,500, respectively, in research and development activities, of which$127,500and$126,500, was reimbursed through a grant agreement, respectively.Tecogen’s SolutionOur CHP products address the inherent efficiency limitation of central power plants by siting generation close to the loads being served.
Consequently, theUltralow-emissions technology is potentially transformative to the engine’s reputation in the energy marketplace, allowing it to now be characterized as a source of clean power.23Table of ContentsFigure 5 — Comparison of Tecogen Ultra Low-Emissions Technology to Other TechnologiesSource:Tecogen Inc.(1)Tecogen emissions based upon actual third party source test data.(2)Microturbine and Fuel Cell NOx data from California Energy Commission, Combined Heat and Power Market Assessment 2010, by ICF international.(3)Stationary engine BACT as defined by SCAQMD.(4)Limits represent CARB 2007 emission standard for Distributed Generation with a 60% (HHV) Overall Efficiency credit.(5)CO data not available for microturbine and fuel cell.Our ProductsWe manufacture natural gas engine-driven cogeneration systems and chillers, all of which are CHP products that deliver more than one form of energy.
