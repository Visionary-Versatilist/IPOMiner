Existing borrowers also provide new leads that could result in new lending opportunities.​•Knowledge of the market.We have intimate knowledge of the Connecticut real estate market, which enhances our ability to identify attractive opportunities and helps distinguish us from many of our competitors.​•Disciplined lending.We utilize rigorous underwriting and loan closing procedures that include numerous checks and balances to evaluate the risks and merits of each potential transaction.​•Vertically-integrated loan origination platform.We manage and control the loan process from origination through closing with our own personnel or independent third parties, including legal counsel and appraisers, with whom we have long relationships.​•Structuring flexibility.As a small, non-bank, geographically-focused real estate lender, we can move quickly and have much more flexibility than traditional lenders to structure loans to suit the needs of our clients.​•No legacy issues.Unlike many of our competitors, we are not burdened by distressed legacy real estate assets.​Market OpportunityWe believe there is a significant market opportunity for a well-capitalized ‘‘hard money’’ lender to originate attractively priced loans to small-scale real estate developers with strong equity positions (i.e.,good collateral), particularly in Connecticut where real estate values in many neighborhoods are stable and substandard properties are being improved, rehabilitated and renovated.
Nevertheless, we remain flexible to take advantage of other real estate opportunities that may arise from time to time, whether they relate to the mortgage market or to direct or indirect investments in real estate.Our strategy to achieve our objective includes the following:•capitalize on opportunities created by the long-term structural changes in the real estate lending market and the continuing lack of liquidity in the commercial and investment real estate markets;​•take advantage of the prevailing economic environment as well as economic, political and social trends that may impact real estate lending currently and in the future as well as the outlook for real estate in general and particular asset classes;​•remain flexible to capitalize on changing sets of investment opportunities that may be present in the various points of an economic cycle; and​•operate to qualify as a REIT and for an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act.​Leverage Policies/Financing StrategyWe use a combination of equity capital and the proceeds of debt financing to fund our operations.
In that case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose a portion or your entire investment.•Our loan origination activities, revenues and profits are limited by available funds.​•We operate in a highly competitive market and competition may limit our ability to originate loans with favorable terms and interest rates.​​4TABLE OF CONTENTS•We may change our investment, leverage, financing and operating strategies, policies or procedures without shareholder consent.​•Management has broad authority to make lending decisions.​•Our future success depends on the continued efforts of our senior executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.​•Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may adversely impact the real estate industry and, hence, our business.​•Security breaches and interruptions could expose us to liability.​•If we overestimate the value of the collateral securing the loan, we may experience losses.​•Difficult conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage-related assets as well as the broader financial markets have resulted in a significant contraction in liquidity for mortgages and mortgage-related assets.​•Short-term loans may involve a greater risk of loss than traditional mortgage loans.​•We may be subject to ‘‘lender liability’’ claims.​•If the loans that we originate or acquire do not comply with applicable laws, we may be subject to material penalties.​•An increase in the rate of prepayment rates may have an adverse impact on the value of our portfolio as well as our revenue and income.​•Our loan portfolio is illiquid.​•The geographic concentration of our loan portfolio may make our revenues and the values of the mortgages and real estate securing our portfolio vulnerable to adverse changes in local and regional economic conditions.​•A prolonged economic slowdown, a lengthy or severe recession or declining real estate values could impair our investments and harm our operations.​•Our due diligence may not reveal all of a borrower’s liabilities or other risks.​•Loans to investors have greater risks than loans to homeowners.​•In the event of a default we may not be able to enforce our rights.​•We do not require borrowers to fund an interest reserve.​•Interest rate fluctuations could reduce our income.​•Liability relating to environmental matters may adversely impact the value of properties securing our loans.​•Defaults on our loans may cause declines in revenues and net income.​•Our revenues and the value of our portfolio may be negatively affected by casualty events occurring on properties securing our loans.​•Borrower concentration could lead to significant losses.​•Our existing credit facility has numerous covenants, which could restrict our growth or lead to a default.​•Our access to additional funding may be limited.​•Our use of leverage may adversely affect the return on our assets and may reduce cash available for distribution to our shareholders, as well as increase losses when economic conditions are unfavorable.​​5TABLE OF CONTENTS•Our management has no experience managing a REIT and limited experience managing a portfolio of assets in the manner necessary to maintain an exemption under the Investment Company Act.​•Complying with REIT requirements may hinder our ability to maximize profits, which would reduce the amount of cash available to be distributed to our shareholders.​•If we fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes.​•REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and may require us to incur debt or sell assets to make such distributions.​•Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.​•Our qualification as a REIT may depend on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given and the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our REIT qualification and result in significant corporate-level tax.​•We may choose to make distributions in our common shares, in which case you may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends you receive.​•Dividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates on dividend income from regular corporations, which could adversely affect the value of our common shares.​•Liquidation of our assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification.​•The ownership limitation in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, may not prevent five or fewer shareholders from acquiring control and may inhibit market activity in our common shares and restrict our business combination opportunities.​•The tax on prohibited transactions

impact the market price of our common shares.​•We may not generate sufficient cash to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements.​•We could be materially and adversely affected if we cannot qualify

unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and any trading volume could decline.​•We have a substantial number of shares of authorized but unissued capital stock, and if we issue additional shares of our capital stock in the future, our existing shareholders will be diluted.​•Investors in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in net tangible book value.​•We have not determined a specific use for a portion of the net proceeds from this offering, and we may use these proceeds in ways with which you may not agree.​​6TABLE OF CONTENTS•We are an “emerging growth company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common shares less attractive to investors.​•We have elected to avail ourselves of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act.​•As a publicly-held, reporting company, we incur significant costs and that management must devote substantial time to reporting and other compliance matters.
We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may change our investment, leverage, financing and operating strategies, policies or procedures without shareholder consent, which may adversely affect the market value of our common shares and our ability to make distributions to shareholders.Currently, we have no policies in place that limit or restrict our ability to borrow money or raise capital by issuing debt securities.
Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from loans in our portfolio as well as our ability to originate new loans, which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and the market price of our common shares.20TABLE OF CONTENTSOur due diligence may not reveal all liabilities of a borrower or other risks.Before making a loan to a borrower, we assess the strength and skills of such entity’s management and other factors that we believe are material to the performance of the loan.
Given the nature of our business, we cannot assure you that we will always be able to borrow the maximum allowed under the terms of the Bankwell Credit Line.These limitations include the following:•prohibiting any liens on any of the collateral securing the Bankwell Credit Line, which is essentially all of our assets;​•prohibiting us from merging, consolidating or disposing of any asset;​•prohibiting us from incurring additional indebtedness exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate;​•prohibiting us from forming or transacting business with any subsidiary or affiliate other than to make loans to our borrowers;​•prohibiting us from allowing any litigation exceeding $50,000 against any of our assets unless we are fully insured against such loss;​•prohibiting us from declaring or paying any cash dividends exceeding our REIT taxable income;​•prohibiting us from purchasing any securities issued by or otherwise invest in any public or private entity; and​•Jeffrey Villano and John Villano must remain as our senior executive officers with day-to-day operational involvement.​Loan covenants include the following:•punctually pay amounts due;​•pay on demand any charges customarily incurred or levied by Bankwell;​•pay any and all taxes, assessments or other charges assessed against us or any of our assets;​​24TABLE OF CONTENTS•pay all insurance premiums;​•maintain our principal deposit and disbursement accounts with Bankwell;​•perfect Bankwell’s lien on the assets;​•comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations of any governmental authority; or​•change the form of or nature of our ownership structure from a REIT.​The loan agreement also includes the following covenants:•we must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.35:1.00 at the end of each fiscal quarter;​•we must maintain a tangible net worth of not less than the sum of  (x) seventy-five percent (75%) of shareholders’ equity immediately following the consummation of the IPO plus (y) sixty percent (60%) percent of net cash proceeds from the sale of any of our equity securities following the consummation of the IPO; and​•each of Jeffrey Villano and John Villano must own not less than 500,000 shares of our issued and outstanding capital stock.​If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under our agreement with Bankwell, and Bankwell could elect to declare outstanding amounts due and payable, terminate its commitments to us, require us to post additional collateral and/or enforce their interests against existing collateral.
Incurring substantial debt could subject us to many risks that, if realized, would materially and adversely affect us, including the risk that:•our cash flow from operations may be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness or we may fail to comply with all of the other covenants contained in the debt, which is likely to result in (i) acceleration of such debt (and any other debt containing a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision) that we may be unable to repay from internal funds or to refinance on favorable terms, or at all, (ii) our inability to borrow unused amounts under our financing arrangements, even if we are current in payments on borrowings under those arrangements and/or (iii) the loss of some or all of our assets pledged or liened to secure our indebtedness to foreclosure or sale;​•our debt may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions with no assurance that yields will increase with higher financing costs;​​26TABLE OF CONTENTS•we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for operations, future business opportunities, shareholder distributions or other purposes; and​•we may not able to refinance debt that matures prior to the asset it was used to finance on favorable terms, or at all.​Risks Related to REIT Status and Investment Company Act ExemptionWe have no experience operating as a REIT or managing a portfolio of assets in the manner necessary to maintain an exemption under the Investment Company Act, which may hinder our ability to achieve our business objectives or result in the loss of our qualification as a REIT.We have no experience operating as a REIT and none of our executive officers have any experience managing a loan portfolio under a set of complex laws, rules and regulations or operating a business in compliance with a set of technical limitations and restrictions as those applicable to REITs. Similarly, we have no experience operating under or avoiding being subject to the Investment Company Act. In addition, we are subject to all of the customary business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business, including the risk that we will not achieve our objectives and, as a result, the value of our common shares could decline substantially.
We intend to distribute our net income to our shareholders in a manner that will satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% nondeductible excise tax.Our ability to pay dividends, the amount of the dividend and the frequency at which we will pay dividends is subject to numerous factors, including the following:•how quickly we can deploy the net proceeds from this offering to make new loans;​•our ability to increase the interest rate on our loans to keep pace with the frequency and size of rate increases under our credit line;​•our ability to manage and control our operating and administrative expenses, particularly those relating to our status as a public reporting REIT;​•defaults by our borrowers;​​28TABLE OF CONTENTS•regional and national economic conditions;​•competition from banks and other financing sources;​•our cash flow from operations;​•unanticipated developments, write-offs or liabilities;​•restrictions and limitations imposed by the BCL; and​•restrictions in our existing and future credit facilities.​Our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, known as U.S. GAAP, and differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur.
