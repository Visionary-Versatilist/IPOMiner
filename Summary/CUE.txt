This portfolio includes our core technology platform for the engineering of biologics to selectively control T cell activity, which we call CUE Biologics™, a growing portfolio of precision immuno-modulatory drug candidates, and two supporting technologies we call MOD™ and viraTope™ that enable the discovery of costimulatory signaling molecules (ligands) and T cell targeting peptides, respectively.The Immune System, Cancer and Autoimmune DiseaseThe human immune system comprises a number of specialized cell types which collectively function to identify and defend the body against foreign threats.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:•our limited operating history, limited cash and a history of losses;​•our ability to achieve profitability;​•our ability to secure required FDA or other governmental approvals for our product candidates and the breadth of the indication sought;​•the impact of competitive or alternative products, technologies and pricing;​•whether we are successful in developing and commercializing our technology, including through licensing;​•the adequacy of protections afforded to us and/or our licensor by the anticipated patents that we own or license and the cost to us of maintaining, enforcing and defending those patents;​•our and our licensor’s ability to protect non-patented intellectual property rights;​•our exposure to and ability to defend third-party claims and challenges to our and our licensor’s anticipated patents and other intellectual property rights;​•our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund our business operations in the future;​•our ability to continue as a going concern; and​•other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus.​The forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions and are made as of the date of this prospectus.
Our efforts may not lead to commercially successful products for a number of reasons, including:•we and our licensor, prospective business partners and other collaborators may not be able to complete research regarding, and nonclinical and clinical development of, our planned product candidates;​•regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations may not be achieved for our planned product candidates, or the scope of the approved indication may be narrower than sought;​​16TABLE OF CONTENTS•we and our licensor, prospective business partners and other collaborators may experience delays in our development program, clinical trials and the regulatory approval process;​•our technology may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical or preclinical trials and our planned product candidates may have adverse side effects which outweigh any potential benefit to patients;​•we may not be able to identify suitable collaborators to complete development or commercialization of our potential products;​•we may not be able to maintain, protect or expand our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;​•any future products that are ultimately approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies may not be commercially accepted in the marketplace by physicians or patients;​•our future products may not be able to be manufactured in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost;​•physicians may not receive any reimbursement from third-party payors, or the level of reimbursement may be insufficient to support widespread adoption of any of our future products; and​•rapid technological change may make our technology and future products obsolete.​Significant additional research and development and clinical testing will be required before we can potentially seek regulatory approval for or commercialize any of our product candidates.We have product candidates in our oncology preclinical development pipeline, but significant additional research and development activity and clinical testing are required before we and our collaborators will have a chance to achieve a commercially viable product from such candidates.
Relying on third-party clinical investigators, CROs or collaborators may result in delays that are outside of our control.17TABLE OF CONTENTSFurthermore, we may not have the financial resources to continue development of, or to enter into collaborations for, a product candidate if we experience any problems or other unforeseen events that delay or prevent regulatory approval of, or our ability to commercialize, product candidates, including:•negative or inconclusive results from our IND-enabling studies, clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for product candidates similar to ours, leading to a decision or requirement to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or abandon a program;​•delays in submitting INDs or comparable foreign applications or delays or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators to commence a clinical trial, or a suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;​•conditions imposed by the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority regarding the number, scope or design of our clinical trials;​•delays in enrolling patients in clinical trials;​•high drop-out rates of patients;​•inadequate supply or quality of clinical trial materials or other supplies necessary to conduct our clinical trials;​•greater than anticipated clinical trial costs;​•poor effectiveness or unacceptable side effects of our product candidates during clinical trials;​•unfavorable FDA or other regulatory agency inspection and review of a clinical trial site;​•failure of our third-party contractors or investigators to comply with regulatory requirements or otherwise meet their contractual obligations in a timely manner, or at all;​•serious and unexpected drug-related side effects or other safety issues experienced by participants in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;​•delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including the imposition of additional regulatory oversight around clinical testing generally or with respect to our technology in particular; or​•varying interpretations of data by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities.​We have never dosed any of our product candidates in humans.
If we are unable to establish additional strategic partnerships or other alternative arrangements to develop our drug candidates, the costs for us to independently develop our drug candidates may be higher than we currently anticipate, which could materially harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operation.19TABLE OF CONTENTSFurther, collaborations involving our planned product candidates are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:•our collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to our collaboration as compared to their other then-existing collaborations;​•our collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization of our programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;​•our collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;​•our collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates;​•a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of each of our potential products;​•our collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights in accordance with the terms of our contractual arrangements with them or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to other potential liability;​•disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our managements’ attention and our other resources;​•collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and​•our collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our potential products that results from our collaboration with them, and in such case, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property without our collaborators’ involvement and consent.​As a result, we may not be able to realize the benefit of collaboration agreements, strategic partnerships or licenses of our technology or potential products, which could delay our product development timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business.
To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information (such as individually identifiable health information), we could incur significant liabilities and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal MattersIf we or our licensor are unable to protect our/its intellectual property, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our technology and potential products could be adversely affected.Patents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies.
We cannot be sure that additional financing from any of these sources will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing will be obtained on favorable terms.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:•the progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll patients in our planned and potential future clinical trials;​•the outcome, timing and cost of regulatory approvals by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities, including the potential that the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities may require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;​•the number and characteristics of product candidates that we may in-license and develop;​​31TABLE OF CONTENTS•our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates;​•the amount of sales and other revenues from product candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party reimbursement;​•selling and marketing costs associated with our potential products, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities;​•the terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;​•cash requirements of any future acquisitions and/or the development of other product candidates;​•the costs of operating as a public company;​•the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale, outsourced manufacturing activities;​•the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;​•any disputes which may occur between us and Einstein, employees, collaborators or other prospective business partners; and​•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.​If we raise additional funds by selling shares of our common stock or other equity-linked securities, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted.
