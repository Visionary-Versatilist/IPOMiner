If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties (which we use to plan our business) are incorrect or change due to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.We have not been profitable historically and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.We have posted a net loss in each fiscal year since we began operations in 2008, including net losses of approximately$30 millionin fiscal2012,$28 millionin fiscal2013and$28 millionfor theninemonths endedSeptember 30, 2014.While we have experienced significant revenue growth in recent periods, we are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of subscriptions to sustain or increase our growth or achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
We anticipate that additional investments in sales personnel, infrastructure and research and development spending will be required to:•scale our operations and increase productivity;•address the needs of our customers;•further develop and enhance our existing solutions and offerings;•develop new technology; and•expand our markets and opportunity under management, including into new solutions and geographic areas.We cannot assure you that our controls, systems and procedures will be adequate to support our future operations or that we will be able to manage our growth effectively.
Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include, without limitation, those listed below:•our ability to attract new customers in multiple regions around the world;•the addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;•the timing of recognition of revenue;•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;17•network outages, security breaches, technical difficulties or interruptions with our services;•general economic, industry and market conditions;•customer renewal rates and the extent to which customers subscribe for additional seats or solutions;•pricing changes upon any renewals of customer agreements;•changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;•the mix of solutions sold during a period;•seasonal variations in sales of our solutions;•the timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;•the announcement or adoption of new regulations and policy mandates or changes to existing regulations and policy mandates;•changes in foreign currency exchange rates;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;•general economic conditions, both domestically and in the foreign markets in which we sell our solutions;•the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill from acquired companies; and•unforeseen litigation and intellectual property infringement.To date, we have derived a substantial majority of our revenue from customers using our Wdesk platform for SEC filings.
We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:•inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;•unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;•incurrence of acquisition-related costs;•difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;•difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;•difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our solutions and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;•diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;•adverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;•the potential loss of key employees;•use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and•use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually.
