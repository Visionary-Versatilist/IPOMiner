We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:•continue development of our product candidates, including initiating additional clinical trials of trilaciclib and G1T38 and initiating clinical trials of our product candidate, G1T48;•identify and develop new product candidates;•seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval;•achieve market acceptance of our product candidates in the medical community and with third-party payors;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire additional personnel;•enter into collaboration arrangements, if any, for the development of our product candidates orin-licenseother products and technologies;•achieve milestones requiring payment under ourin-licensingprograms;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and•incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company.Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies, and conducting clinical trials of
with other companies’ products;•our ability to establish collaboration arrangements for the development of our product candidates on favorable terms, if at all;•the achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under our license agreement and any collaboration agreements into which we may enter, if any;•the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;•the extent to which we acquire orin-licenseproduct candidates and technologies, such as G1T48, and the terms of suchin-licenses;•the costs of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;•revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval; and•the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims.Conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that can take years to complete, and we may never generate the
For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:•execute development activities for our product candidates, including successful enrollment in and completion of clinical trials;•obtain required marketing approvals for the development and commercialization of our product candidates;•obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates and ensure that we do not infringe the valid patent rights of third parties;•protect, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;•establish and maintain clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities or make arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical and commercial manufacturing;•build and maintain robust sales, distribution and marketing capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with strategic partners, if our product candidates are approved;•gain acceptance for our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•compete effectively with other therapies;•obtain and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;•maintain a continued acceptable safety profile for our product candidates following approval, if approved;•develop and maintain any strategic relationships we elect to enter into, if any;14Table of Contents•enforce and defend intellectual property rights and claims; and•manage our spending as costs and expenses increase due to preclinical development, clinical trials, marketing approvals and commercialization.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize
though trilaciclib has demonstrated positive results in preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials, we may not succeed in demonstrating safety and efficacy of trilaciclib in larger-scale clinical trials.Advancing this novel therapy creates significant challenges for us, including:•obtaining marketing approval, as the FDA and other regulatory authorities have limited experience with commercial development of a CDK4/6 inhibitor for this type of use;•educating medical personnel regarding the potential safety benefits, as well as the challenges, of incorporating our product candidates, if approved, into their treatment regimens; and•establishing sales and marketing capabilities upon obtaining any marketing approval to gain market acceptance of a novel therapy.If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, development of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented, which

Our product candidates could be delayed in receiving, or fail to receive, marketing approval for many reasons, including the following:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;•we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;•the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;•we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate’s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;18Table of Contents•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;•the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission to obtain marketing approval in the United States or elsewhere;•third-party manufacturers or our clinical or commercial product candidates may be unable to meet the FDA’s cGMP requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory authorities; and•the approval requirements or policies of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.In addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may

including:•our customers’ ability to obtain reimbursement for our product candidates in foreign markets;•our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;•the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;•different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;•import or export licensing requirements;•longer accounts receivable collection times;•longer lead times for shipping;•language barriers for technical training;•reduced or no protection on pharmaceutical products or their use in some foreign countries;•the unwillingness of courts in some foreign jurisdictions to enforce patents even when valid and infringed in that country;•the possibility ofpre-grantor post-grant review proceedings in certain foreign countries that allow a petitioner to hold up patent rights for an extended period or permanently

The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•the timing of our receipt of any marketing approvals;•the terms of any approvals and the countries in which approvals are obtained;•the efficacy and safety and potential advantages and disadvantages compared to alternative treatments;•the prevalence and severity of any side effects associated with our products;•the indications for which our products are approved;•adverse publicity about our products or favorable publicity about competing products;•the approval of other products for the same indications as our products;•our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;•the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;31Table of Contents•the success of our physician education programs;•the strength of our marketing and distribution support;•the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement, including patient cost-sharing programs such as copays and deductibles; and•any restrictions on the use of our products together with other medications.If any product we commercialize fails to
