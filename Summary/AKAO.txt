patients, hospitals, third-party payors, and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.•We may not be able to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors for plazomicin.•Our use of government funding adds uncertainty to our research and commercialization efforts and subjects us to additional requirements and costs.•If our intellectual property for plazomicin or any future product candidates is not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively.Corporate InformationWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2002 and commenced operations in 2004.
If we are unable to develop, obtain marketing approval for and successfully commercialize plazomicin or experience significant delays in doing so, our business could be materially harmed.We currently have no products approved for sale, and since 2007, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial
Our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize plazomicin effectively will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of our Phase 3 trial or other clinical trials, which will depend substantially upon the satisfactory performance of third-party
benefits and a favorable risk-benefit outcome;•receipt of marketing approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;•establishing commercial manufacturing and supply arrangements;•establishing a commercial infrastructure;•identifying and successfully establishing one or more collaborations to commercialize plazomicin;•acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•establishing market share while competing with other therapies;•successfully executing our pricing and reimbursement strategy;•a continued acceptable safety and adverse event profile of the product following regulatory approval; and•qualifying for, identifying, registering, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims covering the product.In addition, our product development program includes the development of anin vitroassay, which
thein vitroassay in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to commercialize plazomicin, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes that may lead to delayed timelines and
that any interim analyses with respect to such trials will be completed on schedule or support continued clinical development of the associated product candidate.Clinical trials can be delayed or aborted for a variety of reasons, including delay or failure:•to obtain regulatory approval to commence a trial;•to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be
subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;•to obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;•to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;•to have patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•of clinical sites to adhere to trial protocols or continue to participate in a trial;•to address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;•to address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;•to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or•to manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, slow down or halt our

during development or after approval that could delay, prevent or cause the withdrawal of regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval.Serious adverse events or undesirable side effects caused by, or other unexpected properties of, our product candidates could cause us, an
If such an event occurs after plazomicin or such other product candidates are approved, a number of potentially significant negative consequences may result, including:•regulatory authorities may withdraw the approval of such product;•regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label or impose distribution or use restrictions;•regulatory authorities may require one or more post-market studies;•we may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;•we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, if approved, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses,
Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:•continued funding under our contract with BARDA;•the size and type of the nonclinical and clinical trials that we decide to pursue in the development of our product candidates, including plazomicin;•the type, number, costs and results of the product candidate development programs which we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future;•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;•the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals;19Table of Contents•our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;•the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, including litigation
development efforts;•the amount of funds we receive in this offering; and•the costs associated with being a public company.Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies.
