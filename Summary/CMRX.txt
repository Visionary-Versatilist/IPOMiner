Our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in:•obtaining favorable results for and advancing the development of brincidofovir, initially for the prevention of CMV in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, including successfully initiating and completing our Phase 3 clinical development;•obtaining accelerated approval in the United States for brincidofovir for CMV prevention in HCT recipients and equivalent foreign regulatory approvals for brincidofovir;•launching and commercializing brincidofovir, including building a sales force and collaborating with third parties;•achieving broad market acceptance of brincidofovir in the medical community and with third-party payors;•obtaining traditional approval in the United States for brincidofovir for CMV prevention; and•generating a pipeline of product candidates.Conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and achieve product sales.
As a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate revenues from sales of any approved product candidates, or that we will achieve or maintain profitability even if we do generate sales.10TABLE OF CONTENTSIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, seek corporate partners for the development of our product development programs or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates.Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete.
The success of brincidofovir will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of nonclinical studies and successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials;•receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States for our product candidates;•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities, either by building such facilities ourselves or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers;12TABLE OF CONTENTS•launching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•effectively competing with other therapies;•a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval; and•obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize brincidofovir, which would materially harm our business.We have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug and we may be unable to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approval for brincidofovir.We have never obtained regulatory approval for a drug.
state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following:•the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or from knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) which, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly or willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters;•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and its implementing regulations, and as amended again by the final HIPAA omnibus rule, Modifications to the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Enforcement, and Breach Notification Rules Under HITECH and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act; Other Modifications to HIPAA, published in January 2013, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, clearinghouses and healthcare providers;•the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) which prohibits, among other things, the adulteration or misbranding of drugs and devices;•the federal transparency law, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Care Reform Law), and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and•analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state governmental and non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that18TABLE OF CONTENTSrequire pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; and state laws and regulations that require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities.Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs.
We expect that in the future we will continue to rely on such manufacturers for drug supply that will be used in clinical trials of our product candidates, including brincidofovir, and for commercialization of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval.Our reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates ourselves, including:•inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;•delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;•manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;•costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;•failure to comply with cGMP and similar foreign standards;•inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;•termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;•reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;•lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;•operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier;•carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and•failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.Any of these events could lead to clinical study delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products.
