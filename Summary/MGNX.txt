Under this collaboration, one DART program is currently being pursued and we completed our research obligations under this program in January 2014.Our StrategyOur goal is to be a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer, autoimmune disorders and other complex diseases.Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are to:•Rapidly and concurrently advance our clinical oncology product candidates in multiple tumor types.We intend to pursue the fastest feasible
We anticipate that we would structure these collaborations in ways that would allow us to retain development and commercialization rights in key markets.•Create new product candidates that combine the potency and target selectivity of our DART and Fc Optimization technologies with small molecule and
drug development is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and we may ultimately not be able to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercialization of some or all of our product candidates.The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive
that site, or us, due to a number of factors, including:•failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols;•unforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;•lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions; and•upon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason by, current or future collaborators that have responsibility for
pharmacies;•we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;•we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;•sales of the product may decrease significantly;•we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us, our collaborators or our potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase
eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:•decreased demand for our future approved products;•injury to our reputation;•withdrawal of clinical trial participants;21Table of Contents•termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;•increased regulatory scrutiny;•significant litigation costs;•substantial monetary awards to or costly settlement with patients or other claimants;•product recalls or a change in the indications for which they may be used;•loss of revenue;•diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and•the inability to commercialize our product candidates.If any of our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we will be highly dependent upon consumer perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products.
Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:•economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;•potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;•difficulties in compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations;•changes in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers;•changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls;•changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment;22Table of Contents•trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;•negative consequences from changes in tax laws;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•difficulties associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including differing labor relations;•production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods
product candidates.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:•the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we pursue;•the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, pre-clinical development, and clinical trials;•the costs, timing and outcome of seeking and obtaining FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals;•the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates and establishing sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;•our ability to maintain, expand, and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be
required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;•our need and ability to hire additional management, scientific, and medical personnel;•the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our product candidates;•our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; and•the economic and other terms, timing of and success of our existing collaborations, and any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which
collaborations, and any future collaborations we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following:•collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;•collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;•collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue
or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such
commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our technology platforms and our business may be materially and adversely affected.We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential
capital commitments;•changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any cover our common stock;•fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;•public concern over our product candidates or any future approved products;•litigation;37Table of Contents•future sales of our common stock;•share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;•additions or departures of key personnel;•changes in the structure of health care payment systems in the United States or overseas;•failure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;•economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises;•period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or other payments
