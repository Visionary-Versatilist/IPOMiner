We believe that compared with conventional chemical pesticides, our products:nAre competitive in both price and efficacy;nProvide viable alternatives where conventional chemical pesticides and genetically modified crops are subject to regulatory restrictions;nComply with market-imposed requirements for pest management programs by food processors and retailers;nAre environmentally friendly;nMeet stringent organic farming requirements;nImprove worker productivity by shortening field re-entry times after spraying and allowing spraying up to the time of harvest;nAre exempt from residue restrictions applicable to conventional chemical pesticides in both the agriculture and water markets; andnAre less likely to result in the development of pest resistance.In addition, our experience has shown that when our products are used in connection with conventional chemical pesticides, they can:nIncrease the effectiveness of conventional chemical pesticides while reducing their required application levels;nIncrease levels of pest control and consistency of control;nIncrease crop yields;nIncrease crop quality, including producing crops with higher levels of protein, better taste and color and more attractive flowers; andnDelay the development of pest resistance to conventional chemical pesticides.4Table of ContentsOur Sales and Distribution PlatformWe currently sell our crop protection product lines, Regalia, Grandevo and Venerate, through leading agricultural distributors such as Crop Production Services, Simplot and members of the Integrated Agribusiness
