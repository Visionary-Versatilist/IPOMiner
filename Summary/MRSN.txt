future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing XMT-1522 and XMT-1536 and any other potential ADC product candidates and
candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution costs;•our ability to establish and maintain strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;12Table of Contents•the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, including litigation costs and the
outcome of such litigation; and•the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any, or products developed by our partners.Based on our current operating plan, we estimate that the net proceeds we receive from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our projected
our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or ADC product candidates on unfavorable terms to us.We may seek additional capital through a variety of means, including through private and public equity offerings and debt financings.
withdrawal would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.14Table of ContentsWe currently have only one ADC product candidate, XMT-1522, in clinical studies.
operations or study sites;•failure by CROs, other third parties or us to adhere to clinical study requirements;•failure to perform in accordance with the FDA's good clinical practices, or GCP, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;•inadequate quantity or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical studies, including, for example, delays
result in increased costs and longer development periods for our product candidates.Clinical studies require sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including:•the size and nature of the patient population;•the severity of the disease under investigation;•the nature and complexity of the study protocol, including eligibility criteria for the study;•the number of clinical study sites and the proximity of patients to those sites;•standard of care in the diseases under investigation;•the commitment of clinical investigators to identify eligible patients;•competing studies or trials; and•clinicians' and patients' perceptions as to the potential advantages and risks of the drug being studied in relation to other available
application, or BLA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;•the FDA may not accept data generated at our preclinical studies and clinical study sites;•the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical studies;•we may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate's risk-benefit ratio for its
significant negative consequences could result, including:•our clinical studies may be put on hold;•we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for our ADC product candidates;•regulatory authorities may withdraw or limit their approvals of our ADC product candidates;•regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a contraindication, black box warnings or additional warnings;•the FDA may require development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, with Elements to Assure Safe Use, or ETASU, as a
of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our ADC product candidates and could substantially increase commercialization costs.If we or our third-party collaborators are unable to successfully develop and
products in future periods could be compromised, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely impact our stock price.Risks related to our reliance on third partiesBecause we rely on third-party manufacturing and supply partners, our supply of
in a number of ways, including:•an inability to initiate or continue clinical studies of ADC product candidates under development;•delay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for ADC product candidates;•loss of the cooperation of an existing or future strategic partner;•subjecting third-party manufacturing facilities or our manufacturing facilities to additional inspections by regulatory authorities;•a requirement to cease distribution or to recall batches of our ADC product candidates; and•in the event of approval to market and commercialize an ADC product candidate, an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.We, or our third-party manufacturers, may be unable to successfully scale-up
product candidates, including XMT-1522, or generate revenues through technology licensing, or may otherwise negatively affect our business.We have established strategic partnerships and intend to continue to establish strategic partnerships with third parties to research, develop and
partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products, negatively impacting our operating results.We continue to strategically evaluate our partnerships and, as appropriate, we expect to enter into additional strategic partnerships in the future, including
including with respect to any changed or increased regulatory restrictions; and•enter into additional strategic partnerships to advance the development and commercialization of our product candidates.Risks related to our intellectual propertyIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our
Our failure to apply these funds effectively could adversely affect our ability to continue to develop and commercialize our ADC product candidates and harm our business.50Table of ContentsWe will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, and our
