information presented under the heading “Risk factors” and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.OUR COMPANYWe are the leading manufacturer of aluminum-bodied railroad freight cars, which we also refer to as railcars, in North America, based on the number of railcars delivered.
A number of industries in North America rely heavily on rail for the transport of the various inputs and outputs associated with their operations.We believe the main characteristics and trends affecting the railcar industry are:Øthe cyclical nature of the railcar market;Øthe replacement demand for the aging North American railcar fleet;Øthe shift from steel-bodied to aluminum-bodied railcars;Øthe shift in the customer base from railroads to financial institutions and shippers; andØthe consolidation of railcar manufacturers.We believe the main trends affecting the coal-carrying railcar business are:Øthe increase in demand for electricity;Øthe increase in demand for coal as a fuel source; andØthe increase in demand for coal from the western United States.These trends affecting the railcar industry and the coal-carrying railcar business are summarized in the section entitled “Industry.”2Table of ContentsOUR BUSINESS STRENGTHS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGESWe believe that the following key business strengths and competitive advantages will contribute to our growth:ØLeader in coal-carrying railcar market.

Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock, and you may lose all or part of your investment.RISKS RELATED TO THE RAILCAR INDUSTRYWe operate in a highly cyclical industry.
the number of railcars purchased by our financial institution customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The current high cost of the raw materials that we use to manufacture railcars, especially aluminum and steel, and delivery delays associated with
to any such customer, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Since railcars are typically sold pursuant to large, periodic orders, a limited number of customers typically represent a significant percentage of our railcar sales in
business and/or meet any increase in demand, with new or additional manufacturing capabilities, depends on our ability to obtain an adequate supply of these railcar components.While we believe that we could secure alternative sources, we may incur substantial delays and significant expense in doing so, the quality
convention or otherwise), these restrictions could adversely impact the price of and demand for coal, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.17Table of ContentsRisk factorsWe rely upon a single supplier to supply us with all of our cold-rolled center sills for our railcars, and any disruption of our relationship with
reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our manufactured new products under limited warranties, generally for periods of five years or less.
Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including:Øthe cyclical nature of our business;Øadverse economic and market conditions;Øfluctuating costs of raw materials, including steel and aluminum, and delays in the delivery of raw materials;Øour ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components;Øour reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales;Øthe variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion, delivery and acceptance of customer orders;Øthe highly competitive nature of our industry;Ørisks relating to our relationship with our unionized employees and their unions;Øour ability to manage our health care and pension costs;Øour reliance on the sales of our aluminum-bodied coal-carrying railcars;Øthe risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings by our customers;Øthe cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations;Øthe costs associated with being a public company;Øpotential significant warranty claims; andØvarious covenants in the agreement governing our indebtedness that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses.Our actual results could be different from the results described in or anticipated by our
