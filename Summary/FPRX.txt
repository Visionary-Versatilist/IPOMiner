development and regulatory processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing these products.Even if we generate revenues from the sale of any of our products that may be approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.
Our future funding requirements, both short and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical and clinical studies for our product candidates and future product candidates we may develop;nthe outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential
required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights;nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;nmarket acceptance of any approved product candidates;nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;nthe cost and timing of selecting, auditing and potentially validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing; andnthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we
our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our products, if ever, we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt
the FDA, other regulatory authorities, IRBs or the company, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;ndeviations from the trial protocol by clinical trial sites and investigators, or failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;nfailure of our third parties, such as CROs, to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of the product candidates to the clinical sites;nfor clinical trials in selected patient populations, delays in identification and auditing of central or other laboratories and the transfer and validation of
competition for recruiting cancer and rheumatoid arthritis patients in clinical trials, and we or our partners may be unable to timely enroll the patients we need to complete clinical trials on a timely basis or at all.We may not successfully identify, test, develop or commercialize potential product candidates.The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify and validate new protein therapeutic targets, including through the use of our discovery
actions and penalties for noncompliance;nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;nsuspend any ongoing clinical studies;nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; ornseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the
antibody.We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:nthe efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates, including relative to marketed products and product candidates in development by third parties;nthe time it takes for our product candidates to complete clinical development and receive marketing approval;nthe ability to commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;nthe price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;nwhether coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement are available under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;nthe ability to establish, maintain and protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates;nthe ability to manufacture commercial quantities of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval; andnacceptance of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval by physicians and other healthcare providers.Our product candidates may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary
a number of factors, including:nthe efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials;nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products;nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;nacceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment by physicians, clinics and patients;nthe potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third parties and government authorities;nrelative convenience and ease of administration;nthe frequency and severity of adverse events;nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; andnunfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.18Table of ContentsIf any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals,
could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.Recently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or
