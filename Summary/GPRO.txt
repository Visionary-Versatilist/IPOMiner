performance.ŸIf our sales during the holiday season fall below our forecasts, our overall financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.ŸWe may have difficulty in accurately predicting our future customer demand, which could adversely affect our operating results.ŸOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.ŸTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, we must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions.ŸWe are subject to international business uncertainties.ŸWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO.7Table of ContentsŸIf we do not effectively maintain and further develop our sales channels, including developing and supporting our retail sales channel and distributors, our

Our reliance on single source, or a limited number of, suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:Ÿsupplier capacity constraints;Ÿprice increases;Ÿtimely delivery;Ÿcomponent quality;Ÿfailure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions;Ÿdelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies; andŸnatural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events.16Table of ContentsIn particular, we incorporate video compression and image processing semiconductors from one provider, Ambarella,
sales, due to macroeconomic conditions, a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities or supply chain disruptions, or for any other reason, would cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly.In contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation
If we fail to continue to develop the infrastructure that enables us to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.17Table of ContentsOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, including our primary trademarks “GoPro” and “Be a Hero.” The GoPro name and

If we fail to effectively manage new product introductions, our revenue and profitability may be harmed.18Table of ContentsAny material disruption of our information systems could adversely affect our operating results.We are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our ecommerce website, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries,
