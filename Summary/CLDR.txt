These risks include:•we have a history of losses, and we may not become profitable in the future;•we have a short operating history, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations;•the market for our data management and analytics platform may develop more slowly than we expect;•we face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors;•our customers may not renew or expand their subscriptions, or may do so on unfavorable terms;•our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large subscriptions, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense;•we do not have an adequate history with our subscription or pricing models to accurately predict the long‑term rate of customer adoption or renewal, or the impact these will have on our revenue or operating results;•our results may fluctuate significantly from period to period;•we face risks because we derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform, and we may fail to satisfy customer demands or achieve increased market acceptance;•we have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, and we may fail to adequately protect confidential information and our intellectual property rights; and•our directors, executive officers and stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock, and their affiliates, who after this offering will collectively hold approximately 43.6% of our outstanding common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of August 31, 2017, will have the ability to influence or control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.If we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected.Corporate History and InformationWe were incorporated in Delaware in 2008, and we had 1,606 full‑time employees as of July 31, 2017.
Furthermore, to the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur increased losses because customer acquisition costs and upfront costs associated with new customers are higher in the first year than the aggregate revenue we recognize from those new customers in the first year.We expect to continue to make significant future expenditures related to the development and expansion of our business, including:•investments in our research and development team and in the development of new solutions and enhancements of our platform, including contributions to the open source data management ecosystem;•investments in sales and marketing, including expanding our sales force, increasing our customer base, increasing market awareness of our platform and development of new technologies;•expanding of our operations and infrastructure, including internationally;•hiring additional employees; and•incurring costs associated with general administration, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to being a public company upon completion of this offering.As a result of these increased expenses, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to be profitable in future periods.
If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our growth rate or revenue that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our main sources of current and potential competition fall into four categories:•legacy data management product providers such as HP, IBM, Oracle and Teradata;•public cloud providers who include proprietary data management, machine learning and analytics offerings, such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure;•strategic and technology partners who may also offer our competitors’ technology or otherwise partner with them, including our strategic partners who provide Partner Solutions (see “Business—Partners and Strategic Alliances”) as they may offer a substantially similar solution based on a competitor’s technology; and•open source companies, including Hortonworks and MapR, as well as internal IT organizations that provide open source self‑support for their enterprises.Many of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:•greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger customer bases;16Table of Contents•larger sales and marketing budgets and resources and the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products;•broader, deeper or otherwise more established relationships with technology, channel and distribution partners and customers;•wider geographic presence or greater access to larger customer bases;•greater focus in specific geographies;•lower labor and research and development costs;•larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and•substantially greater financial, technical and other resources to provide support, to make acquisitions and to develop and introduce new products.In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader and more diverse product and service offerings and may be able to leverage their relationships with distribution partners and customers based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our platform, including by selling at zero or negative margins, product bundling or offering closed technology platforms such as IBM Watson.
If we are unable to sufficiently differentiate our solutions from the integrated or bundled products of our competitors, such as by offering enhanced functionality, performance or value, we may see a decrease in demand for those solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.In addition, new innovative start‑up companies, and larger companies that are making significant investments in research and development, may introduce products that have greater performance or functionality, are easier to implement or use, or incorporate technological advances that we have not yet developed or implemented or may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our platform.
Factors that may cause fluctuations in our periodic financial results include, without limitation, those listed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section and those listed below:•the budgeting cycles and purchasing practices of our customers, including their tendency to purchase in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, and near the end of each quarter;•the achievement of milestones in connection with delivery of services, impacting the timing of services revenue recognition;•subscriptions from the Global 8000 and other large enterprises;•price competition;19Table of Contents•our ability to attract and retain new customers;•our ability to expand penetration within our existing customer base;•the timing and success of new solutions by us and our competitors;•changes in customer requirements or market needs and our ability to make corresponding changes to our business;•changes in the competitive landscape, including consolidation among our competitors or customers;•general economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets;•the timing and amount of certain payments and expenses, such as research and development expenses, sales commissions and stock‑based compensation, including the recording of stock‑based compensation expense as a result of the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units (RSUs) including in connection with this offering;•our inability to adjust certain fixed costs and expenses, particularly in research and development, for changes in demand;•increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as an increasing portion of our revenue is collected and expenses are incurred and paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar;•the cost of and potential outcomes of existing and future claims or litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business;•future accounting pronouncements and changes in our accounting policies; and•changes in tax laws or tax regulations.Any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of some of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our operating results.
If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our platform and solutions, our business operations, financial results and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.20Table of ContentsWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights.
Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:•an acquisition may negatively impact our results of operations because it:–may require us to incur charges, including integration and restructuring costs, both one‑time and ongoing, as well as substantial debt or liabilities, including unanticipated and unknown liabilities,–may cause adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges,–may result in acquired in‑process research and development expenses or in the future may require the amortization, write‑down or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill and other intangible assets, or–may not generate sufficient financial returns for us to offset our acquisition costs;•we may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;•an acquisition and integration process is complex, expensive and time consuming, and may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;•an acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;•an acquisition may result in increased regulatory and compliance requirements;•an acquisition may result in increased uncertainty if we enter into businesses, markets or business models in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have stronger market positions;•we may encounter difficulties in maintaining the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire, and we may be dependent on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of the companies we acquire;•we mail fail to maintain sufficient controls, policies and procedures, including integrating any acquired business into our control environment;•we may fail to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary software or services;•we may obtain unanticipated or unknown liabilities, including intellectual property or other claims, or become exposed to unanticipated risks in connection with any acquisition; and•an acquisition may involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience.29Table of ContentsIf we are unable to address these difficulties and challenges or other problems encountered in connection with any future acquisition or investment, we might not realize the anticipated benefits of that acquisition or investment, we might incur unanticipated liabilities or we might otherwise suffer harm to our business generally.To the extent we pay the consideration for any future acquisitions or investments in cash, the payment would reduce the amount of cash available to us for other purposes.
