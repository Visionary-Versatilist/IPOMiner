as an adjunctive therapy for schizophrenia, and ACP-104 for the treatment of schizophrenia.In connection with clinical trials, we face risks that:•a drug candidate may not prove to be efficacious;•patients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the drug candidate being tested;•the results may not confirm the positive results of earlier trials; and•the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory agencies.1Table of ContentsIf we do not successfully complete preclinical and clinical development, we will be unable to market and
can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:•demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;•reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and clinical trial sites;•manufacturing sufficient quantities of a drug candidate;•obtaining approval of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, from the FDA;•obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; and•insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical
Our future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:•progress in, and the costs of, our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development programs;•the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;2Table of Contents•the ability of our collaborators and us to reach the milestones, and other events or developments, triggering payments under our collaboration agreements or to otherwise make
payments under these agreements;•the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production; and•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our drug candidates.Until we can generate significant continuing revenues, we expect to satisfy
using our drug candidates or technologies because they:•do not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as limited cash or human resources;•decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration; or•cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.The continuation of our collaborations is dependent on our collaborators’ periodic renewal of the governing agreements.

trials of our drug candidates, they may fail for other reasons.Even if we successfully complete the clinical trials of our drug candidates, they may fail for other reasons, including the possibility that the drug candidates will:•fail to receive the regulatory clearances required to market them as drugs;•be subject to proprietary rights held by others requiring the negotiation of a license agreement prior to marketing;4Table of Contents•be difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;•have adverse side effects that make their use less desirable; or•fail to compete with drug candidates or other treatments commercialized by our competitors.Our drug candidates may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to

Any legal action against our company or our collaborators could lead to:•payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent rights;•injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products; or•we or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.As a result, we could be prevented from commercializing current or future
