can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in:•demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial;•reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations and clinical trial sites;•manufacturing sufficient quantities of a drug candidate;•obtaining approval of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, from the FDA;•obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; and•insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical
Our future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:•progress in, and the costs of, our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other research and development programs;•the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;2Table of Contents•the ability of our collaborators and us to reach the milestones, and other events or developments, triggering payments under our collaboration agreements or to otherwise make
payments under these agreements;•the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production; and•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our drug candidates.Until we can generate significant continuing revenues, we expect to satisfy

trials of our drug candidates, they may fail for other reasons.Even if we successfully complete the clinical trials of our drug candidates, they may fail for other reasons, including the possibility that the drug candidates will:•fail to receive the regulatory clearances required to market them as drugs;•be subject to proprietary rights held by others requiring the negotiation of a license agreement prior to marketing;4Table of Contents•be difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;•have adverse side effects that make their use less desirable; or•fail to compete with drug candidates or other treatments commercialized by our competitors.Our drug candidates may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to

ACP-104 and ACP-103, we have not been issued any patents with respect to ACP-104, and have been issued only two patents with respect to ACP-103.Our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and technologies is uncertain due to a number of factors, including:•we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications or issued patents;•we may not have been the first to file patent applications for our drug candidates or the technologies we rely upon;•others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;•our disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;•any or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;•we may not seek or obtain patent protection in all countries that will eventually provide a significant business opportunity;9Table of Contents•any patents issued to us or our collaborators may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by
Any legal action against our company or our collaborators could lead to:•payment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent rights;•injunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize and sell products; or•we or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.As a result, we could be prevented from commercializing current or future
lose our competitive advantage and competition we face would increase, reducing our potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.Risks Related to Our IndustryWe will be subject to stringent regulation in connection with the marketing of any products derived from our drug candidates, which could delay the development and
failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues from the particular drug candidate.Outside the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities.

Prior to the completion of our initial public offering in June 2004, our Board of Directors determined the fair market value of our common stock after considering many factors, including:•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities,•the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish,•the fact that our options involved illiquid securities in a non-public company,•prices of preferred stock issued by us to outside investors in arm’s-length transactions,•the rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock over our common stock, and•the likelihood that our common stock would become liquid through an initial public offering, an acquisition of us or another event.Following the completion of our initial public offering, pursuant to the 2004
