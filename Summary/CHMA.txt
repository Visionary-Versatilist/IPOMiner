to achieve our corporate and strategic goals based on the following key strengths:•Based on our clinical data and feedback from patients and healthcare providers, we believe oral octreotide has the potential to become a standard of care in the treatment of acromegaly.•Oral octreotide is the only somatostatin analog formulated for oral administration to complete a Phase 3 clinical trial.•Treatment of acromegaly is a well-characterized market that we believe we can address with a focused and differentiated commercial infrastructure.•Our business model and regulatory strategy utilizing the FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway target shorter development timelines and lower associated expenses.•We believe that we have the ability to leverage our proprietary TPE platform to develop additional high-value oral therapeutics.•Our leadership team has significant drug development and commercial experience and possesses important intellectual capital.Risks Affecting UsOur business is subject to a number
The FDA may determine that our NDA for oral octreotide for the treatment of acromegaly is not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.4Table of Contents•Even if we receive regulatory approval of oral octreotide, we may still face future development and regulatory challenges.•We face substantial competition from larger companies with considerable resources that already have somatostatin analogs available in the market, and they or others may also discover, develop or commercialize additional
collaborators and, even if we do, our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business.•We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the next several years and thus may never achieve or maintain profitability.•We may need additional capital to support our growth, which may be difficult to obtain and restrict our operations and would result in additional dilution to our stockholders.•If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our technology and product candidates, our competitors could develop and commercialize
Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization of Oral Octreotide and any Future Product CandidatesWe are heavily dependent on the regulatory approval of oral octreotide for the treatment of acromegaly in the United States and Europe, and subsequent
The success of oral octreotide, if approved, will depend on several factors, including:•execution of an effective sales and marketing strategy for the commercialization of oral octreotide;•acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•the incidence and prevalence of acromegaly in those markets in which oral octreotide is approved;•the prevalence and severity of side effects, if any, experienced with oral octreotide;•the availability, perceived advantages, cost, safety and efficacy of alternative treatments;•our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of oral octreotide;•successful implementation of our manufacturing processes that are included in our new drug application, or NDA, and production of sufficient quantities of commercial drug product;•maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs; and•obtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio.11Table of ContentsWe may also fail to develop future product candidates.
success of oral octreotide will depend on the receipt and maintenance of regulatory approval and the issuance and maintenance of such approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees may disagree with the design or conduct of our clinical trials;•we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of oral octreotide’s safety and efficacy;•the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;•the dosing of oral octreotide in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;•patients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to oral octreotide;•the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;•the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies or may later
