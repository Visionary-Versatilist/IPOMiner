We intend to use the proceeds of this offering to reduce our leverage, which, along with our access to cash, the SG Credit Line and our stock, will give us the flexibility to pursue these opportunities, facilitating our strategy of increasing revenue and our share of the OTP market.Our IndustryWe currently compete in three distinct markets within the OTP industry: (i) the smokeless products market, which includes loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff, (ii) the smoking products market, which includes cigarette papers, MYO cigar wraps and related products as well as cigars, MYO cigarettes and traditional pipe tobacco, and (iii) the new generation (“NewGen”) products market, which includes liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products and other products without tobacco and/or nicotine.We believe that the OTP industry is characterized by non-cyclical demand, relative brand loyalty, consistent profit margins, relatively low price elasticity and the ability to generate consistent cash flows.
In 2015, our five most important producers were:•Bolloré, which provides us with exclusive access to theZig-Zag®cigarette paper and accessories brand for the U.S. and Canada;•Swedish Match, which manufactures all of our loose leaf chewing tobacco;•VMR, which provides us with the exclusive supply ofV2®branded electronic cigarettes, e-liquids, and vaporizers in the U.S.;•Durfort, from which we source our MYO cigar wraps; and•JJA, from which we source ourZig-Zag®branded cigarillos.By outsourcing the production of products that represent over 85% of our revenues to a select group of producers with whom we have strong relationships, we are able to maintain low overhead and minimal capital expenditures, which together drive our margins.Experienced Management TeamWith an average of 23 years of consumer products experience, including an average of 19 years in the tobacco industry, our senior management team has enabled us to grow and diversify our business while improving operational efficiency.

An Emerging Growth Company may take advantage of specified reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies, such as:•we are not required to engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”);•we are not required to include more than two years of audited financial statements in this prospectus;•we are not required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the “PCAOB”) regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);•we are not required to submit certain executive compensation matters to stockholder advisory votes, such as “say-on-pay,” “say-on-frequency” and “say-on-golden parachutes;” and•we are not required to disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the chief executive officer’s compensation to median employee compensation.We may take advantage of these exemptions for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.For as long as we continue to be an Emerging Growth Company, we expect that we will take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements available to us as a result of that classification.
Some of these limitations are:•They do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;•They do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;•They do not reflect our significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and17TABLE OF CONTENTS•Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.To compensate for these limitations, we consider the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently and through the use of other financial measures, such as capital expenditure budget variances, investment spending levels and return on capital analysis.The following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated.Year EndedDecember 31,(U.S. dollars in thousands)201520142013Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income:Net income (loss)$9,149$(29,405)$(1,609)Add:Interest Expense34,28434,31144,094Amortization Expense——27Depreciation Expense1,059933905Income Tax Expense1,078370486EBITDA$45,570$6,209$43,903Components of Adjusted EBITDALoss on extinguishment of debt(a)—42,780441LIFO adjustment(b)(56)(798)716Pension/Postretirement expense(c)34116407Non-cash stock option and incentives expense234585234Foreign exchange hedging(d)(35)——Other items(e)4,550—3,908Adjusted EBITDA$50,604$48,792$49,609(a)Represents loss related to the repurchase and redemption of our previously outstanding second and third lien notes in 2014 and the termination of a revolving credit facility in 2013.(b)Represents non-cash expense related to an inventory valuation allowance for last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) reporting.(c)Represents our Pension/Postretirement expense.(d)Represents non-cash gain and loss stemming from our foreign exchange hedging activities.(e)Other items:•For the year ended December 31, 2015, the adjustment amounted to approximately $4.6 million, which consisted of $0.4 million relating to the one-time relocation of finished product for improved logistical services from three third-party distribution warehouses to a new third-party distribution warehouse, $2.3 million in fees for the study of strategic initiatives and $1.9 million of product launch costs of our new product lines, including our vaporizers within the NewGen segment.•For the year ended December 31, 2013, the aggregate adjustment amounted to $3.9 million, which consisted of approximately $3.2 million in expense related to the settlement of a contractual dispute regarding Gordian Group, LLC’s alleged right to remuneration under the terms of a 2009 engagement letter, an additional $0.1 million consisting of $0.5 million in legal expenses less $0.4 million reimbursement from our insurance company relating to the Langston Complaint (as described below) that was paid in 2013, and $0.6 million in expense relating to product launch costs of our new product lines, including our e-cigarettes and cartomizers within our NewGen segment.(5)We calculate our Leverage Ratio by dividing Notes payable and long-term debt by Adjusted EBITDA.
In addition, we do not know whether we will be able to renew any or all of our agreements on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all.Any disruptions in our relationships with Bolloré, Swedish Match, Durfort, JJA or VMR, a failure to renew any of our agreements, an inability or unwillingness by any supplier to produce sufficient quantities of our products in a timely manner or finding a new supplier would have a significant impact on our ability to continue distributing the same volume and quality of products and maintain our market share, even during a temporary disruption, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be unable to identify or contract with new suppliers or producers in the event of a disruption to oursupply.In order to continue selling our products in the event of a disruption to our supply, we would have to identify new suppliers or producers that would be required to satisfy significant regulatory requirements.
