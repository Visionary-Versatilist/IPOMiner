Two of the five ASICs are expected to be included in reference designs for certain of our strategic partners to enable them to develop consumer-facing products incorporating our technology for sale beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2015.We are also developing what we believe will be an enterprise class management and control system for our WattUp solution that will incorporate cloud based network management as well as the necessary local interface and control for the transmitter and receiver.We believe that if our development, regulatory and commercialization efforts are successful, our transmitter and receiver solutions will initially be able to simultaneously charge up to 24 devices, ranging from ¼ watt up to sixteen (16) watts, depending on the number of devices, with a range of fifteen (15) feet in radius or in1TABLE OF CONTENTSa charging envelop bounded by thirty (30) feet.
The risks are discussed more fully in the section of this prospectus below titled “Risk Factors.”•We have no history of generating revenue, have a history of operating losses, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.•We expect that we will need additional capital to achieve our business goals.•We may raise additional financing by issuing new securities that may have terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock and our business.•Our technology under development is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and by other governmental agencies and we may have difficulty complying with applicable regulations.•Even if we do successfully commercialize our technology, it may never achieve widespread market acceptance.•Our industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in products or new solutions that are superior to our technology under development or other future products we may bring to market from time to time.
If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our technology may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer.•We may be unable to protect our intellectual property and could face infringement claims on our intellectual property which could damage our prospects for future revenue opportunities with current and prospective partners.•We intend to pursue licensing of our technology as a primary means of commercialization but we may not be able to secure advantageous license agreements.•We could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management’s attention and harm our business.3TABLE OF CONTENTSTHE OFFERINGThe information below is only a summary of more detailed information included elsewhere in this prospectus.

The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•actual or anticipated variations in operating results;•the limited number of holders of the common stock;•changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other technology companies;14TABLE OF CONTENTS•our announcements of significant strategic partnerships or other events;•announcements by other companies in the wire-free charging space;•additions or departures of key personnel; and•sales or other transactions involving our capital stock, including sales that may occur following the termination of applicable lock-up periods.We are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (“JOBS Act”), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:•our limited cash and a history of losses;•our ability to achieve profitability;•our limited operating history;•emerging competition and rapidly advancing technology;•customer demand for the products we develop;•our ability to secure required FCC or other governmental approvals;•the impact of competitive or alternative products, technologies and pricing;•our ability to successfully license any products we develop to consumer electronics supply chain firms;•general economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our potential customers;•the adequacy of protections afforded to us by the patents that we own and the cost to us of maintaining, enforcing and defending those patents;•our ability to obtain, expand and maintain patent protection in the future, and to protect our non-patented intellectual property;•our exposure to and ability to defend third-party claims and challenges to our patents and other intellectual property rights;•our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future;•our ability to continue as a going concern;•our success at managing the risks involved in the foregoing items; and•other factors discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this prospectus.The forward-looking statements are based upon management’s beliefs and assumptions and are made as of the date of this prospectus.
available parts and components, which are not optimized and may be too large to be incorporated into commercially marketed products.We are developing multiple generations of transmitter and receiver application specific integrated circuits (“ASICs”) that we believe will optimize our technology by reducing size and cost, while increasing performance to a level that we believe will allow for them to be integrated into low-power devices (defined as devices requiring less than 10 watts), thereby eliminating the need for a charging cord or pad to maintain a charge.
financing to, among other reasons, accelerate our product development efforts, regulatory activities and business development and support functions with a view to capitalizing on the market opportunity we see for our wire-free charging technology.During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, cash flows used in operating activities were $8,490,970, consisting of a net loss of $36,579,100 less non-cash expenses aggregating $27,024,780 (representing principally the amortization of debt discount of $964,851, stock based compensation of $1,659,404 and the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of $26,265,177 offset by the gain on the conversion of notes of $2,084,368).
