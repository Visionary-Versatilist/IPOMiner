PF Black Card members, and could in turn have an adverse effect on our and our franchisees’ reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition as well as our ability to profit from sales of tanning equipment to our franchisees.In addition, from time to time, government agencies and other regulatory authorities have shown an interest in taking investigative or regulatory action
