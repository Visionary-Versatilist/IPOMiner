December 31, 2005 and the nine months ended September 30, 2006, Pollo Tropical generated total revenues of $137.0 million and $115.3 million, respectively.Taco Cabana:Our Taco Cabana restaurants serve fresh Tex-Mex and traditional Mexican style food, including sizzling fajitas,
related liabilities from our consolidated balance sheet and recognized gains from the sales, which were generally deferred and are being amortized as an adjustment to rent expense over the remaining term of the underlying leases.As a result of the above transactions that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2006, we reduced our lease financing obligations by $52.8

Carrols used those net proceeds as follows:•approximately $74.4 million was used to repay borrowings outstanding under the prior senior credit facility;•approximately $3.1 million was paid to repurchase stock options held by a former employee;•approximately $175.9 million was used to retire all $170 million aggregate principal amount of Carrols’ 91/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008, which we refer to in this prospectus as the “old notes,” that were then outstanding;•approximately $116.8 million was used to pay a dividend to our stockholders; and•approximately $20.9 million was distributed to our employees (including management) and a director who owned options to purchase our common stock on a pro rata basis in proportion
to the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options owned by those persons (which included $0.6 million in employer payroll taxes).In this prospectus we refer to the debt offering, Carrols entering into the senior credit facility and the term loan borrowings thereunder, the repayment
These changes in pricing and other marketing strategies have had, and in the future may continue to have, a negative impact on our sales and earnings.Factors specific to the quick-casual and quick-service restaurant segments may adversely affect our results of operations, which may cause a decrease in earnings and
many factors, including:•changes in local, regional or national economic conditions;•changes in demographic trends;•changes in consumer tastes;•changes in traffic patterns;•increases in fuel prices, including a continuation of the current relatively higher levels of gasoline prices;•consumer concerns about health and nutrition;•increases in the number of, and particular locations of, competing restaurants;•inflation;•increases in utility costs;•increases in the cost of food, such as beef and chicken, and packaging;•consumer dietary considerations;14Table of Contents•increased labor costs, including healthcare and minimum wage requirements;•regional weather conditions; and•the availability of experienced management and hourly-paid employees.Our continued growth depends on our ability to open and operate new restaurants profitably, which in turn depends on our continued access to capital, and newly acquired or developed restaurants may not perform as we expect and we cannot
Development involves substantial risks, including the following:•the inability to fund development;•development costs that exceed budgeted amounts;•delays in completion of construction;•the inability to obtain all necessary zoning and construction permits;•the inability to identify, or the unavailability of, suitable sites on acceptable leasing or purchase terms;•developed restaurants that do not achieve desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened;•incurring substantial unrecoverable costs in the event a development project is abandoned prior to completion;•the inability to recruit, train and retain managers and other employees necessary to staff each new restaurant;•changes in governmental rules, regulations and interpretations; and•changes in general economic and business conditions.We
to pursue our business strategies; and defaults under our debt instruments may allow the lenders to declare borrowings due and payable.The senior credit facility and the Indenture governing the Notes limit our ability, among other things, to:•incur additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;•pay dividends or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments;•sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;•agree to limitations on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to make distributions;•enter into transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates;•incur liens;•enter into new lines of business; and•engage in consolidations, mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets.In addition, the senior credit facility requires us to comply with various operational and other covenants and restricts our ability to prepay our subordinated indebtedness.
