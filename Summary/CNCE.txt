Net losses and negative cash flows have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity (deficit) and working capital.We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:Øcontinue to develop and conduct clinical trials with respect to CTP-354;Øinitiate and continue research, preclinical and clinical development efforts for our other product candidates and potential product candidates;Øseek to identify additional product candidates;Øseek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;Øestablish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which we may obtain
marketing approval;Ørequire the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;Ømaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;Øhire additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;Øadd operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and personnel and
Our future funding requirements, both short-term and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:Øthe progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for, our product candidates and
and commercialization of CTP-499;Øour current collaboration agreements remaining in effect and achievement of milestones under these agreements;Øour ability to enter into and the terms and timing of any additional collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;Øthe number of product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements;Øthe outcome, timing and costs of seeking regulatory approvals;Øthe costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval, to the extent such costs are not the
responsibility of one of our collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities;Øsubject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates;Øour headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure;Øthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against
intellectual property related claims; andØthe costs of operating as a public company.14Table of ContentsRisk factorsRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, including purchasers of common stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product

approval of CTP-354.The success of CTP-354 will depend on several factors, including the following:Øsuccessful completion of clinical trials, which could require lifting of the partial clinical hold onCTP-354or agreement by the FDA that the dosing protocols necessary to support successful completion of clinical trials are not subject to the partial clinical hold;Øreceipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;Øour ability to develop a solid dose formulation of CTP-354;Øthe performance of our future collaborators for CTP-354, if any;Øthe extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;Øestablishment of supply arrangements with third party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers;Øestablishment of arrangements with third party manufacturers to obtain finished drug products that are appropriately packaged for sale;Øobtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;Øprotection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;Ølaunch of commercial sales if and when approved;17Table of ContentsRisk factorsØa continued acceptable safety profile of CTP-354 following any marketing approval;Øcommercial acceptance, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third party payors; andØcompetition with other therapies, including baclofen, tizanidine, benzodiazepines and injected botulinum toxin.If we are unable to develop, receive marketing approval for, or successfully commercialize CTP-354, or experience delays as a result of any of these

The degree of market acceptance of CTP-354 or any of our other product candidates, including those licensed to our collaborators, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:Øthe efficacy and safety of the product;Øthe potential advantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;Øthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;Øthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;Øwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;Ølimitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product’s approved labeling;Øour ability, or the ability of our collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;Øthe product’s convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;Øthe willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;Øthe strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;Øthe approval of other new products for the same indications;Øchanges in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;Øthe timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;Øavailability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third party payors;Øadverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; andØpotential product liability claims.The potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to precisely estimate.
