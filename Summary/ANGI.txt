Moreover, as our base of paid memberships expands and the number of local service providers rated and reviewed by our members grows, we may see an increase in fraudulent or
advertising revenue depends on a number of factors, including:•increasing the number of paid memberships in our existing markets;•maintaining high levels of member engagement;•competing effectively for advertising dollars with other online and offline advertising providers; and•continuing to develop and diversify our advertising offerings.Historically, advertising markets for local service providers have been dominated by traditional offline advertising media, such as
information services could negatively impact our relationship with our members, our brand and reputation and our ability to attract, retain and serve our members and service providers.If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, operating and financial results may suffer.We have recently experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant growth in new and existing markets, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and
maintain the necessary level of discipline and efficiency, or if we fail to allocate limited resources effectively in our organization as it grows, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.We may not maintain our current rate of revenue growth.Our paid membership base has grown rapidly in recent periods in new and existing markets.
