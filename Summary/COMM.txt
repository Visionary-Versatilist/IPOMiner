including, but not limited to:•successfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology;•integrating the sales organizations and maintaining and increasing the customer base;•retaining key employees, suppliers and distributors;•integrating management information, inventory, accounting and research and development activities; and•addressing operating losses related to individual facilities or product lines.Any future acquisition could
subject to a number of risks, including:•the ability of our selected channel partners to effectively sell our products to end customers;•our ability to continue channel partner arrangements into the future because most are for a limited term and subject to mutual agreement to extend;•a reduction in gross margins realized on sale of our products; and•a diminution of contact with end customers which, over time, could adversely impact our ability to develop new products that meet customers’ evolving requirements.In the past, we have seen some distributors acquired and consolidated.
contract manufacturers, to meet customer demand for our products, we may experience lost sales opportunities and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business depends on effective information management systems.We rely on our enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing; inventory control;
Factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements and projections include:•our dependence on customers’ capital spending on communication systems;•concentration of sales among a limited number of customers or distributors;•changes in technology;•our ability to fully realize anticipated benefits from prior or future acquisitions or equity investments;•industry competition and the ability to retain customers through product innovation, introduction and marketing;•risks associated with our sales through channel partners;•possible production disruptions due to supplier or contract manufacturer bankruptcy, reorganization or restructuring;•the risk our global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays causing difficulty in meeting customer demands;•the risk that internal production capacity and that of contract manufacturers may be insufficient to meet customer demand or quality standards for our products;•our ability to maintain effective information management systems and to successfully implement major systems initiatives;•cyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses;•product performance issues and associated warranty claims;•significant international operations and the impact of variability in foreign exchange rates;•our ability to comply with governmental anti-corruption laws and regulations and export and import controls worldwide;•risks associated with currency fluctuations and currency exchange;•the divestiture of one or more product lines;•political and economic instability, both in the U.S. and internationally;40•potential difficulties in realigning global manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities, including delays or challenges related to removing, transporting or reinstalling equipment,
that may affect ability to meet customer demands for products;•possible future restructuring actions;•possible future impairment charges for fixed or intangible assets, including goodwill;•increased obligations under employee benefit plans;•cost of protecting or defending intellectual property;•changes in laws or regulations affecting us or the industries we serve;•costs and challenges of compliance with domestic and foreign environmental laws and the effects of climate change;•changes in cost and availability of key raw materials, components and commodities and the potential effect on customer pricing;•risks associated with our dependence on a limited number of key suppliers;•our ability to attract and retain qualified key employees;•allegations of health risks from wireless equipment;•availability and adequacy of insurance;•natural or man-made disasters or other disruptions;•income tax rate variability and ability to recover amounts recorded as value-added tax receivables;•labor unrest;•risks associated with future research and development projects;•increased costs as a result of operating as a public company;•our ability to comply with new regulations related to conflict minerals;•risks associated with the seasonality of our business;•substantial indebtedness and maintaining compliance with debt covenants;•our ability to incur additional indebtedness;•cash requirements to service indebtedness;•ability of our lenders to fund borrowings under their credit commitments;•changes in capital availability or costs, such as changes in interest rates, security ratings and market perceptions of the businesses in which we operate, or the ability to obtain capital on commercially reasonable
Amortization of purchased intangible assets excludes amortization amounts included in cost of sales of $0.5 million for the period from January 1, 2011 to January 14, 2011.(2)During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded net restructuring charges of $20.6 million as a result of integration and cost reduction actions initiated in 2008 to realign and lower our cost structure and
experienced a substantial increase in net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the comparable period in the prior year primarily as a result of higher capital spending by U.S. wireless operators, including 4G
increase in Enterprise segment operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to higher net sales, a favorable shift in mix, the positive impact of cost reduction
