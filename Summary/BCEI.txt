exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both.A decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure
default in their obligations, we have significant exposure to adverse changes in the prices of oil and natural gas that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Our identified drilling locations are scheduled to be developed over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or
drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling
For the year ended December 31, 2008, we based the estimated discounted future net revenues from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect at
cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:•our proved reserves;•the volume of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce and sell from existing wells;•the prices at which our crude oil and natural gas are sold;•our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and•the ability of our banks to lend.If
our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower crude oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any
future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.We may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.We purchase working and revenue interests in oil and natural gas leasehold interests from third parties or directly from the mineral
and retaining the personnel required to grow and operate our business profitably.Our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we
currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements, subject to certain limitations pursuant to our credit facility, for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including
customers could have an adverse effect on us, temporarily reducing our cash flow.Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.On September 12, 2011, President Obama sent to Congress a legislative package that includes proposed legislation that, if enacted into
exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local
year-end tax rates to future pretax net cash flows relating to proved oil and natural gas reserves.
