including:•lack of acceptable prospective acreage;•inadequate capital resources;•reductions in oil and natural gas prices;•unexpected drilling conditions, including pressure or irregularities in formations and equipment failures or accidents;•adverse weather conditions, such as blizzards and ice storms;•unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment or labor;•title problems;•compliance with governmental regulations;•delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; and•mechanical difficulties.According
exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both.A decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure
Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and may affect our proved reserves.Additionally, as of November 30, we had commodity price hedging agreements on approximately 29% of our estimated Boe production.

drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling
drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the

cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:•our proved reserves;•the volume of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce and sell from existing wells;•the prices at which our crude oil and natural gas are sold;•our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves; and•the ability of our banks to lend.If
our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower crude oil or natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any

currently, and may in the future, enter into derivative arrangements, subject to certain limitations pursuant to our credit facility, for a portion of our oil and natural gas production, including
addition, these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas.The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the United States Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect
customers could have an adverse effect on us, temporarily reducing our cash flow.Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.On September 12, 2011, President Obama sent to Congress a legislative package that includes proposed legislation that, if enacted into
exploration and development, and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.Our oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local
We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.Federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.Our operations utilize hydraulic fracturing, an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells in
formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing.Climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of "greenhouse gases" could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that

following factors could affect our stock price:•our operating and financial performance and drilling locations, including reserve estimates;•quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and

response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•domestic and worldwide supplies and prices of, and demand for, oil and gas;•changes in environmental and other governmental regulations affecting the oil and gas industry;•variations in our quarterly results of operations or cash flows; and•changes in general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the oil and gas industry.The
