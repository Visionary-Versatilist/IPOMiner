Our strategy consists of:•focusing our investments primarily in loans secured by single-family residences with opportunistic mortgages or direct investment in smaller commercial properties, such as smaller mixed-use commercial facilities with ground floor retail units and residences above them;​​3TABLE OF CONTENTS•constructing and owning a portfolio of re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans at significant discounts to UPB and underlying property values;​•concentrating our investments in geographic areas, cities and neighborhoods with certain demographic and economic trends and attributes that we believe will lead to HPA above the national average;​•working, through Gregory, to (1) support the continued performance of re-performing loans; (2) convert a portion of our non-performing loans to re-performing status; (3) determine optimal loss mitigation strategy on an asset-by-asset basis for remaining loans; and (4) manage the process and timelines for converting non-performing loans to sale or rental REO, including potentially offering financing to REO purchasers;​•when economically efficient, securitizing our re-performing whole loan portfolios to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing, while retaining one or more tranches of any subordinated securities we may create; and​•opportunistically mitigating our interest rate and prepayment risk by using a variety of hedging instruments.​Based on the experience of our Manager’s management team, we believe that acquiring re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans will result in a more efficient way to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns and provide us a material cost advantage over other real property acquisition channels, such as foreclosure auctions and REO acquisitions.
In addition, our Manager and the Servicer own an aggregate of 373,168 shares of our common stock and their institutional equity owners or their affiliates own an aggregate of 4,882,353 shares of our common stock (assuming redemption of 624,106 OP Units purchased by one such investor on a 1-for-1 basis into shares of our common stock).Our PortfolioAs of January 31, 2015, our portfolio of mortgage-related assets consisted of the following:Portfolio as of January 31, 2015​No. of Loans(1)​​​​1,449​​​Total UPB​​​​$321,133,153​​​Interest-Bearing Balance​​​​$299,932,870​​​Deferred Balance(2)​​​​$21,200,284​​​Market Value of Collateral(3)​​​​$332,302,084​​​Price/Total UPB(3)​​​​69.9%​​​Price/Market Value of Collateral​​​​67.7%​​​Weighted Average Coupon(4)​​​​5.06%​​​Weighted Average LTV(5)​​​​114%​​​Remaining Term (as of 1/31/2015)​​​​295.5​​​No. of first liens​​​​1,434​​​No. of second liens​​​​15​​​No. of Rental Properties​​​​3​​​Market Value of Collateral​​​​$366,900​​​Capital Invested​​​​289,954​​​Price/Market Value ofCollateral​​​​79.0%​​​Gross Rent/Month​​​​$3,800​​​Other REO​​​​18​​​Market Value of Collateral(1)​​​​$3,009,500​​​​(1)Information reflects 1 loan in which we hold a 40.5% beneficial interest through an equity method investee, 24 loans in which we have a 95% participation interest and are owned by the Servicer because neither we nor our subsidiaries have the necessary licenses in certain states and 39 loans that closed in February 2015 with a total UPB of  $8.62 million.​(2)Amounts that have been deferred in connection with a loan modification on which interest does not accrue.
Certain of our existing stockholders, including certain affiliates, purchased an aggregate of 730,000 shares of our common stock in the IPO at the initial public offering price.In the Original Private Placement, Flexpoint Great Ajax Holdings LLC, or the Flexpoint REIT Investor, an affiliate of an investment fund managed by Flexpoint Ford LLC, and an investment fund for which Wellington Management Company LLP is the investment advisor, or the Wellington Management Institutional Investor, each directly or through one or more affiliated entities purchased (i) an aggregate of 3,290,726 shares of our common stock (in the case of the Wellington Management Institutional Investor, assuming redemption of 468,106 OP Units on a 1-for-1 basis into shares of our common stock); (ii) 9.8% of the equity of Great Ajax FS LLC (“GA-FS”), the parent of the Servicer (4.9% of which was represented by a note that converted automatically into shares in September 2014); (iii) two non-transferable ten-year warrants, which permit each holder to acquire an additional 9.9% equity interest in GA-FS at a premium to the original purchase price, exercisable subject to certain regulatory requirements or in the event of a contemporaneous sale of the equity interests of GA-FS; and (iv) 26.73% of the equity of our Manager.
For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders’ equity means: (a) the sum of (i) the net proceeds from any issuances of common stock or other equity securities issued by us or our operating partnership (without double counting) since inception (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), and (ii) our and our operating partnership’s (without double counting) retained earnings calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, at the end of the most recently completed fiscal quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less (A) any amount that we or our operating partnership pays to repurchase shares of common stock or OP Units since inception, (B) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have affected consolidated stockholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (C) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors.
Our Manager has agreed that, for so long as the management agreement is in effect and provided that either we have on hand an average of  $25 million in capital available for investment over the previous two fiscal quarters or our independent directors determine that we have the ability to raise capital at or above our most recent book value, neither it nor any of its affiliates will (i) sponsor or manage any investment vehicle or company whose investment strategy will involve acquiring re-performing or non-performing mortgage loans unless our Manager obtains the prior approval of a majority of our independent directors or (ii) acquire assets consistent with our investment mandate on behalf of another investment vehicle unless we are first offered the investment opportunity and a majority of our board of directors (including a majority of our independent directors) decide not to acquire such assets.In addition, to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our Manager, we will not purchase portfolio assets from (or sell portfolio assets to) our directors or officers, our Manager, Aspen, or any of their affiliates, nor will we engage in any transaction in which these persons have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including in connection with the securitization of any of our mortgage loan assets.
Gregory has agreed, provided that either we have on hand an average of  $25 million in capital available for investment over the previous two fiscal quarters or our independent directors determine that we have the ability to raise capital at or above our most recent book value, not to service re-performing or non-performing mortgage loans for either affiliates of our Manager or independent third parties; however, as long as the majority of our independent directors approve, Gregory can service any assets for affiliates or independent third parties, including if we determine not to acquire assets that would otherwise be appropriate for us.Our Exclusion from Regulation as an Investment CompanyWe intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
See “Risk Factors” beginning on page21of this prospectus, for more detailed discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock.•We have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business in accordance with the REIT requirements or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders.​•A significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we acquire are, or may become, non-performing loans, which could increase our risk of loss.​•The supply of re-performing and non-performing loans may decline over time as a result of higher credit standards for new loans and/or general economic improvement, and the prices for re-performing and non-performing loans may increase, which could materially and adversely affect us.​•We may be materially and adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the single-family rental properties in which our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.​•Recent changes in consumer mortgage loan regulations may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance our purchased mortgage loans.​•A significant change in delinquencies for the loans we will own could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​​17TABLE OF CONTENTS•Market conditions and other factors may affect our ability to securitize assets, which could increase our financing costs and adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions.​•Prepayment rates can change, adversely affecting the performance of our assets and our ability to reinvest the proceeds thereof.​•The real estate assets and real estate-related assets we intend to or may invest in are subject to the risks associated with real property.​•An increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the amount of certain of our target assets that are available for acquisition, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire target assets that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends.​•The principal and interest payments on our retained MBS are not guaranteed by any entity and, therefore, are subject to increased risks, including credit risk.​•The Servicer’s operations are heavily regulated at the U.S. federal, state and local levels and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could materially adversely affect our expenses and results of operations, and there is no assurance that we could replace the Servicer with servicers that satisfy our requirements or with whom we could enter into agreements on satisfactory terms.​•The failure of the Servicer to service our assets effectively would materially and adversely affect us.​•We may incur significant costs in restoring our properties, and we may underestimate the costs or amount of time necessary to complete such restorations.​•We may change our investment strategy, investment guidelines and asset allocation without notice or stockholder consent, which may result in riskier investments.
In addition, our charter provides that our board of directors may authorize us not to seek to elect to be taxed as a REIT or to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of our stockholders.​•Our inability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.​•Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend on our operating results, our financial condition and other factors and we may not be able to make regular cash distributions at a fixed rate or at all under certain circumstances.​•We use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the return on our assets and may reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and increase losses when economic conditions are unfavorable.​•Hedging against interest rate changes and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.​•We operate in a highly regulated industry and continually changing U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.​•We have conflicts of interest with our Manager, the Servicer and Aspen, and certain members of our board of directors, as well as our management team, have, or could have in the future, conflicts of interest due to their respective relationships with these entities, and such conflicts could be resolved in a manner adverse to us.​•Our board of directors has approved a very broad investment policy and guidelines for our Manager and will not review or approve each investment decision.
These provisions may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares of common stock.​•Failure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock and would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.​•The taxable mortgage pool, or TMP, rules may increase the taxes that we, or certain of our stockholders, may incur and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.​•Failure to comply with the tax regulations with respect to Thetis TRS and any other TRS that we form would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax.​•The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, may deem the gains from sales of our properties to be subject to a 100% prohibited transaction tax.​Our Principal OfficeOur principal offices are located at 9400 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy, Suite 131, Beaverton, OR 97005.
The results of our operations depend on factors over which we have no control, including the availability of acquisition opportunities, the level and volatility of interest rates, the availability of adequate short and long-term financing, conditions in the mortgage loan and financial markets and general economic conditions.A significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we acquire are, or may become, non-performing loans, which could increase our risk of loss.We expect to acquire residential mortgage loans where the borrower has failed to make timely payments of principal and/or interest currently or in the past.
There can be no assurance that we will conduct any specific level of due diligence, or that, among other things, our due diligence processes will uncover all relevant facts or that any purchase will be successful, which could result in losses on these assets, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.The failure of a seller of mortgage loans to provide all the necessary documentation to us could adversely affect our ability to leverage our assets or otherwise service the mortgage loans that we will own.Pursuant to customary provisions in the purchase agreements governing our loan acquisitions, we also generally will have the right to cause the sellers to repurchase certain loans if they do not provide proper documentation to evidence ownership or first lien status with respect to such loans within a specified time period.
The valuation process has been particularly difficult recently because market events have made valuations of certain assets unpredictable, and the disparity of valuations provided by third-party dealers has widened.29TABLE OF CONTENTSOur business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially adversely affected if our fair value measurements of these assets were materially higher than the values that would exist if a ready market existed for these assets.The lack of liquidity of our assets may adversely affect our business, including our ability to sell our assets.We acquire assets, securities or other instruments that are not liquid or publicly traded, and market conditions could significantly and negatively affect the liquidity of other assets.In addition, mortgage-related assets generally experience periods of illiquidity, including the recent period of delinquencies and defaults with respect to residential and commercial mortgage loans.
If borrowers default on the mortgage loans backing our MBS and we are unable to recover any resulting loss through the foreclosure process, our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially adversely affected.The Servicer’s operations are heavily regulated at the U.S. federal, state and local levels and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could materially adversely affect our expenses and results of operations, and there is no assurance that we could replace the Servicer with servicers that satisfy our requirements or with whom we could enter into agreements on satisfactory terms.The Servicer must comply with a wide array of U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that regulate, among other things, the manner in which it services our mortgage loans and manages our real property in accordance with the servicing agreement, including recent CFPB mortgage servicing regulations promulgated pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. These laws and regulations cover a wide range of topics such as licensing; allowable fees and loan terms; permissible servicing and debt collection practices; limitations on forced-placed insurance; special consumer protections in connection with default and foreclosure; and protection of confidential, nonpublic consumer information (privacy).
If those assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our operating results and cash available for distribution could be lower than expected, potentially materially.Rental rates and occupancy levels for single-family residential properties have benefited in recent periods from macroeconomic trends affecting the U.S. economy and residential real estate and mortgage markets in particular, including:•a tightening of credit that has made it more difficult to finance a home purchase, combined with efforts by consumers generally to reduce their exposure to credit;​•economic and employment conditions that have increased foreclosure rates;​•reduced real estate values that challenged the traditional notion that homeownership is a stable investment; and​•the unprecedented level of vacant housing comprising the REO owned by banks, GSEs, and other mortgage lenders or guarantors.​The single-family rental market is currently significantly larger than in historical periods.
We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments, either upon maturity or if accelerated, upon an event of default, or that we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on those debt instruments.37TABLE OF CONTENTSHedging against interest rate changes and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.Subject to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT and exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates.
Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:•interest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;​•available interest rate hedges may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;​•the duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related assets or liabilities being hedged;​•to the extent hedging transactions do not satisfy certain provisions of the Code or are not made through a TRS, the amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions to offset interest rate losses is limited by the Code provisions governing REITs;​•the value of derivatives used for hedging is adjusted from time to time in accordance with accounting rules to reflect changes in fair value; and downward adjustments, or “mark-to-market losses,” would reduce our stockholders’ equity;​•the credit quality of the hedging counterparty owing money on the hedge may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and​•the hedging counterparty owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.​Our hedging transactions, which would be intended to limit losses, may actually adversely affect our earnings, which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders.Our use of certain hedging techniques may expose us to counterparty risks.If an interest rate swap counterparty cannot perform under the terms of the interest rate swap, we may not receive payments due under that swap, and thus, we may lose any unrealized gain associated with the interest rate swap.
Laws, regulations, rules and judicial and administrative decisions relating to mortgage loans include those pertaining to real estate settlement procedures, equal credit opportunity, fair lending, fair credit reporting, truth in lending, fair debt collection practices, service members protections, compliance with net worth and financial statement delivery requirements, compliance with U.S. federal and state disclosure and licensing requirements, the establishment of maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, qualified mortgages, secured transactions, payment processing, escrow, loss mitigation, collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures, and other trade practices and privacy regulations providing for the use and safeguarding of non-public personal financial information of borrowers.
Our service providers, including the Servicer and outside foreclosure counsel retained to process foreclosures, must also comply with many of these legal requirements.39TABLE OF CONTENTSIn particular, the Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry in the United States and includes, among other things (i) the creation of a Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify emerging systemic risks posed by financial firms, activities and practices, and to improve cooperation among U.S. federal agencies, (ii) the creation of the CFPB, authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products and services, including mortgage lending and servicing, and to exercise supervisory authority over participants in mortgage lending and mortgage servicing, (iii) the establishment of strengthened capital and prudential standards for banks and bank holding companies, (iv) enhanced regulation of financial markets, including the derivatives and securitization markets, and (v) amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, or TILA, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, aimed at improving consumer protections with respect to mortgage originations and mortgage servicing, including disclosures, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards, prepayment considerations, appraisals and loss mitigation and other servicing requirements.In addition, although we do not intend to acquire MBS in which the underlying mortgage loans are guaranteed or insured by any GSE or U.S. Governmental agency, actions taken by or proposed to be taken by, among others, FHFA, the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board or other U.S. governmental agencies that are intended to regulate the origination, underwriting guidelines, servicing guidelines, servicing compensation and other aspects of mortgage loans guaranteed by the GSEs or U.S. governmental agencies (known as “Agency RMBS”) can have indirect and sometimes direct effects on our business and business model, results of operations and liquidity.
Accordingly, we believe that the interest apportionment regulation will not apply to residential mortgage loans that we acquire for less than their face amount.Nevertheless, if the IRS were to assert successfully that our residential mortgage loans are secured by property other than real estate, then, depending upon the value of the real property securing our residential mortgage loans and their face amount and the sources of our gross income generally, we might not be able to satisfy the 75% gross income test applicable to REITs. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Gross Income Tests.” If we did not meet this test, we could potentially either lose our REIT status or be required to pay a tax penalty to the IRS.Failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each calendar year at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (including certain items of non-cash income), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain.
If we are compelled to liquidate our assets to repay obligations to our lenders or for other reasons, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, thereby jeopardizing our ability to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.Our qualification as a REIT and exemption from U.S. federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets that we acquire, and the inaccuracy of any such opinions, advice or statements may adversely affect our ability to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT and result in significant corporate-level tax.When purchasing securities, we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities, or statements made in related offering documents, for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the value of such securities, and also to what extent those securities constitute qualified real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests and produce income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test.
You should carefully consider these risks before you make an investment decision with respect to our common stock, along with the following factors that could cause actual results to vary from our forward-looking statements:•the factors referenced in this prospectus, including those set forth under the sections captioned “Risk Factors,” “Business” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”;​•our ability to implement our business strategy;​•difficulties in identifying re-performing and non-performing loans and properties to acquire;​•the impact of changes to the supply of, value of and the returns on re-performing and non-performing loans;​•our ability to convert non-performing loans into performing loans, or to modify or otherwise resolve such loans;​•our ability to convert non-performing loans to properties that can generate attractive returns either through sale or rental;​•our ability to compete with our competitors;​•our ability to control our costs;​•the impact of changes in interest rates and the market value of the collateral underlying our re-performing and non-performing loan portfolios or of our other real estate assets;​•our ability to obtain financing arrangements on favorable terms, or at all;​•our ability to retain our engagement of our Manager;​•the failure of the Servicer to perform its obligations under the servicing agreement;​•general volatility of the capital markets;​•the impact of adverse real estate, mortgage or housing markets and changes in the general economy;​•changes in our business strategy;​•our failure to qualify or maintain qualification as a REIT;​•our expectations regarding the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act;​•our failure to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act; and​•the impact of adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes.​​60TABLE OF CONTENTS​USE OF PROCEEDSWe will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the selling stockholders.61TABLE OF CONTENTS​PRICE RANGE OF COMMON STOCKOur common stock has been traded on the NYSE under the symbol “AJX” since February 13, 2015.
Changes in our investment strategy and investment policy and targeted asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, counterparty risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could materially and adversely affect us.Policies with Respect to Certain TransactionsOther than (i) the transactions pursuant to which we acquired our initial portfolio from Little Ajax II and from Gregory (see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources”), (ii) transactions in which Gregory is the holder of record because we or our subsidiaries may not hold the necessary license to hold those assets directly, but where we are the beneficial owner of at least 95% of the participation rights in those assets, or (iii) as approved by a majority of the independent members of our board of directors, we will not purchase portfolio assets from, or sell them to, our directors or officers or to our Manager, Aspen or any of their affiliates, or engage in any transaction in which they have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest, including in connection with the securitization of any of our mortgage loan assets (other than our agreements with our Manager, the Servicer and Aspen described in more detail in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions”).Policies with Respect to Certain Other ActivitiesWe intend to raise additional funds through future offerings of equity or debt securities or the retention of cash flow (subject to REIT distribution requirements) or a combination of these methods.
With limited exceptions, the general partner, though our Manager, may execute, deliver and perform agreements and transactions on behalf of our operating partnership without the approval or consent of any limited partner.Governance and Restrictions on Our Manager’s OperationsUnder the operating agreement for our Manager, as long as either Flexpoint REIT Investor and the Wellington Management Institutional Investor owns not less than 4.9% of the outstanding equity of our Manager, our Manager may not (directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or otherwise), and may not cause or permit its subsidiaries to, engage in the following activities without the consent of such investor(s) that own not less than 4.9% of our Manager’s outstanding equity:•Engage in any business activities other than as expressly authorized by the operating agreement;​•Issue or sell any membership interest in our Manager or authorize any options or incentive equity in excess of that approved by the members;​•Make any payment in distribution to, or redemption of the membership interest of, any member other than as expressly provided in the operating agreement of our Manager;​•Create, incur, assume or become responsible for the payment of any indebtedness, including any funded debt, any liability to a subsidiary or affiliate, and any guaranty of indebtedness of another​​118TABLE OF CONTENTSperson (or agree to the amendment of the terms of any of the foregoing) in excess of  $10,000 individually or $50,000 in the aggregate, other than intercompany payments specified in the approved budget and trade payables, in each case that are incurred in the ordinary course and are not material in the aggregate;•Incur, assume or suffer any lien upon or in respect of any of its property or assets to secure any indebtedness;​•Acquire any material assets or properties other than as expressly contemplated by the operating budget;​•Enter into partnerships, joint ventures or material business alliances with any person;​•Form or establish any subsidiary or otherwise acquire an interest in, or contribute capital to, any person;​•(i) Sell or otherwise dispose of any assets of our Manager (including the shares of our common stock owned by our Manager) other than obsolete assets sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business or (ii) sell or agree to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of our Manager, (iii) make any public offering of securities of our Manager, (iv) combine the assets of our Manager with the assets of any other entity or participate with any other entity in any investment, or (v) consolidate or merge with any other entity;​•Terminate its existence, liquidate, or file for or otherwise commence proceedings with respect to bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or similar status;​•Initiate, settle or compromise any material litigation, arbitration, investigation, audit or other proceeding;​•Subject to existing related party lines of credit and other arrangements to be disclosed to the investors, (i) be a party to any transaction or other arrangement with its managers, the owners and principals of Aspen Yo, their family members or any entity owned or controlled by any of them or (ii) agree to any non-deminimis amendment, modification or waiver of any such arrangement that was previously approved by the investors;​•Change its form of organization or make or change any tax election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of tax accounting, waive or extend the statute of limitations in respect of taxes or file any claim for a tax refund, amend any tax return, enter into any closing agreement with respect to taxes, or settle any tax claim or assessment or surrender any right to a claim for a tax refund, offset or other reduction in tax liability;​•Make any loan or advance to any person, other than advances of business expenses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice;​•Adopt or amend any equity incentive or other employee benefit plan or arrangement, including any employment or severance arrangement;​•Make payments, including payments to Aspen Yo or any other affiliate of our Manager, in excess of amounts specified in the approved budget, subject to a de minimis basket;​•Terminate, or modify or waive in any material respect, the management agreement or any other management agreement of our Manager or a subsidiary with us;​•Modify or waive any provision of the operating agreement of our Manager;​•Subcontract or delegate our management other than to a wholly owned subsidiary of our Manager;
