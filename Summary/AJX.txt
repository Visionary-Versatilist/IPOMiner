Our strategy consists of:•focusing our investments primarily in loans secured by single-family residences with opportunistic mortgages or direct investment in smaller commercial properties, such as smaller mixed-use commercial facilities with ground floor retail units and residences above them;​​3TABLE OF CONTENTS•constructing and owning a portfolio of re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans at significant discounts to UPB and underlying property values;​•concentrating our investments in geographic areas, cities and neighborhoods with certain demographic and economic trends and attributes that we believe will lead to HPA above the national average;​•working, through Gregory, to (1) support the continued performance of re-performing loans; (2) convert a portion of our non-performing loans to re-performing status; (3) determine optimal loss mitigation strategy on an asset-by-asset basis for remaining loans; and (4) manage the process and timelines for converting non-performing loans to sale or rental REO, including potentially offering financing to REO purchasers;​•when economically efficient, securitizing our re-performing whole loan portfolios to create long-term, fixed rate, non-recourse financing, while retaining one or more tranches of any subordinated securities we may create; and​•opportunistically mitigating our interest rate and prepayment risk by using a variety of hedging instruments.​Based on the experience of our Manager’s management team, we believe that acquiring re-performing and non-performing mortgage loans will result in a more efficient way to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns and provide us a material cost advantage over other real property acquisition channels, such as foreclosure auctions and REO acquisitions.
Gregory has agreed, provided that either we have on hand an average of  $25 million in capital available for investment over the previous two fiscal quarters or our independent directors determine that we have the ability to raise capital at or above our most recent book value, not to service re-performing or non-performing mortgage loans for either affiliates of our Manager or independent third parties; however, as long as the majority of our independent directors approve, Gregory can service any assets for affiliates or independent third parties, including if we determine not to acquire assets that would otherwise be appropriate for us.Our Exclusion from Regulation as an Investment CompanyWe intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.
See “Risk Factors” beginning on page21of this prospectus, for more detailed discussion of the factors you should consider before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock.•We have a limited operating history and may not be able to operate our business in accordance with the REIT requirements or generate sufficient revenue to make or sustain distributions to our stockholders.​•A significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we acquire are, or may become, non-performing loans, which could increase our risk of loss.​•The supply of re-performing and non-performing loans may decline over time as a result of higher credit standards for new loans and/or general economic improvement, and the prices for re-performing and non-performing loans may increase, which could materially and adversely affect us.​•We may be materially and adversely affected by risks affecting borrowers or the single-family rental properties in which our investments may be concentrated at any given time, as well as from unfavorable changes in the related geographic regions.​•Recent changes in consumer mortgage loan regulations may make it more difficult for borrowers to refinance our purchased mortgage loans.​•A significant change in delinquencies for the loans we will own could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​​17TABLE OF CONTENTS•Market conditions and other factors may affect our ability to securitize assets, which could increase our financing costs and adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions.​•Prepayment rates can change, adversely affecting the performance of our assets and our ability to reinvest the proceeds thereof.​•The real estate assets and real estate-related assets we intend to or may invest in are subject to the risks associated with real property.​•An increase in interest rates may cause a decrease in the amount of certain of our target assets that are available for acquisition, which could adversely affect our ability to acquire target assets that satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends.​•The principal and interest payments on our retained MBS are not guaranteed by any entity and, therefore, are subject to increased risks, including credit risk.​•The Servicer’s operations are heavily regulated at the U.S. federal, state and local levels and its failure to comply with applicable regulations could materially adversely affect our expenses and results of operations, and there is no assurance that we could replace the Servicer with servicers that satisfy our requirements or with whom we could enter into agreements on satisfactory terms.​•The failure of the Servicer to service our assets effectively would materially and adversely affect us.​•We may incur significant costs in restoring our properties, and we may underestimate the costs or amount of time necessary to complete such restorations.​•We may change our investment strategy, investment guidelines and asset allocation without notice or stockholder consent, which may result in riskier investments.
In addition, our charter provides that our board of directors may authorize us not to seek to elect to be taxed as a REIT or to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of our stockholders.​•Our inability to compete effectively in a highly competitive market could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.​•Our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will depend on our operating results, our financial condition and other factors and we may not be able to make regular cash distributions at a fixed rate or at all under certain circumstances.​•We use leverage in executing our business strategy, which may adversely affect the return on our assets and may reduce cash available for distribution to our stockholders and increase losses when economic conditions are unfavorable.​•Hedging against interest rate changes and other risks may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.​•We operate in a highly regulated industry and continually changing U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.​•We have conflicts of interest with our Manager, the Servicer and Aspen, and certain members of our board of directors, as well as our management team, have, or could have in the future, conflicts of interest due to their respective relationships with these entities, and such conflicts could be resolved in a manner adverse to us.​•Our board of directors has approved a very broad investment policy and guidelines for our Manager and will not review or approve each investment decision.
These provisions may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares of common stock.​•Failure to qualify as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, which could adversely affect the value of shares of our common stock and would substantially reduce the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.​•The taxable mortgage pool, or TMP, rules may increase the taxes that we, or certain of our stockholders, may incur and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations.​•Failure to comply with the tax regulations with respect to Thetis TRS and any other TRS that we form would jeopardize our REIT status and may result in the application of a 100% excise tax.​•The Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, may deem the gains from sales of our properties to be subject to a 100% prohibited transaction tax.​Our Principal OfficeOur principal offices are located at 9400 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy, Suite 131, Beaverton, OR 97005.
The results of our operations depend on factors over which we have no control, including the availability of acquisition opportunities, the level and volatility of interest rates, the availability of adequate short and long-term financing, conditions in the mortgage loan and financial markets and general economic conditions.A significant portion of the residential mortgage loans that we acquire are, or may become, non-performing loans, which could increase our risk of loss.We expect to acquire residential mortgage loans where the borrower has failed to make timely payments of principal and/or interest currently or in the past.
