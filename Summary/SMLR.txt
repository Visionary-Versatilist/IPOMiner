According to the SAGE Group, there are approximately 160,000 amputations due to PAD per year and, according to the National Limb Loss Information Center, an estimated 2 million Americans are amputees.Risk factors for developing PAD include:•Age (over 50 years)​•Race (African-American)​•History of smoking​•Diabetes​•High blood pressure​•High blood cholesterol​•Personal history of vascular disease, heart attack, or stroke.​​3TABLE OF CONTENTSWe believe medical personnel who care for those older than 50 years are the target market for FloChec®, along with those insurance plans that have a high number of Medicare Advantage patients.
There is no assurance that we will ever achieve or maintain profitability;​•If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected;​•We currently only have one product, FloChec®, that we market on a stand-alone basis, or incorporate into our multi-test platform, WellChec™; neither FloChec®nor our multi-test platform WellChec™ may achieve broad market acceptance or be commercially successful;​•Physicians may not widely adopt FloChec®unless they determine, based on experience, long-term clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles, that the use of FloChec®provides a safe and effective alternative to other existing ABI devices along with beneficial economic returns; and​•If healthcare providers and insurance plans are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for patient care based on health risk assessments done using our product or multi-test service platform, it is unlikely that our product or risk assessment platform will gain widespread acceptance.​Our Corporate InformationWe were incorporated in the State of Oregon on August 9, 2007, established C-corporation status in 2012, and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation during 2013.
We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.We could remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of  (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period and (iv) December 31, 2019 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act).
Accordingly, as a result of our available cash, our auditor’s report for year ended December 31, 2014 includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.” In the event that we are unable to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities or raise additional funds, such as through the completion of this offering, we may be required to delay, reduce or severely curtail our operations or otherwise impede our on-going business efforts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and long-term prospects.If we do not successfully implement our business strategy, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.Our business strategy was formed based on assumptions about the peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, market that might prove wrong.
Accordingly, there is a risk that our products may not be adopted by many physicians, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.11TABLE OF CONTENTSIf healthcare providers are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement either for procedures performed using our product or patient care incorporating the use of our product, it is unlikely that our product will gain widespread acceptance.Maintaining and growing revenues from our products and service offerings depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs.
If we operate our business without insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us that would have otherwise been covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.We will need to generate significant revenues to become and remain profitable.We intend to increase our operating expenses substantially as we add sales representatives to increase our geographic sales coverage, increase our marketing capabilities, pursue research and new product and service offering development and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.
Service costs relating to our product may be greater than anticipated, rentals may be returned prior to the end of the license term, and we may be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with FloChec®.Failure to successfully introduce improve or update our products on a cost-effective basis, or delays in customer decisions related to the evaluation of our products could cause us to lose market acceptance and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We operate in an intensely competitive and rapidly changing business environment, and there is a substantial risk our products or service offerings could become obsolete or uncompetitive.The market for medical systems, equipment and other devices and services is highly competitive.
Even if we receive necessary regulatory approvals, there is no guarantee that such approved products or any new service offerings will achieve market acceptance and we may never realize the benefits of any investment in this strategy.Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory EnvironmentOur business is subject to many laws and government regulations governing the manufacture and sale of medical devices, including the FDA’s 510(k) clearance process, and laws and regulations governing patient data and information, among others.FloChec®and any future medical devices that we may develop or services that we may offer are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the federal government, including by the FDA.
Any such additional clearance processes with the FDA could delay our ability to market a modified product and may adversely affect our results of operations.Moreover, as we explore other opportunities to generate revenue, which include performing risk assessment testing for physicians or insurance plans on their patient pools, we are subject to additional laws and regulations regarding the provision of such services.
More specifically, if FDA concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that FloChec®or any future medical device we develop is ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could:•require us to notify health professionals and others that our devices present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to public health;​•order us to recall, repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that we manufactured or distributed;​•detain, seize or ban adulterated or misbranded medical devices;​•refuse to provide us with documents necessary to export our product;​•refuse requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or new intended uses;​•withdraw 510(k) clearances that are already granted;​•impose operating restrictions, including requiring a partial or total shutdown of production;​•enjoin or restrain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices; and/or​•assess criminal or civil penalties against our officers, employees or us.​If the FDA concludes that we failed to comply with any regulatory requirement during an inspection, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
