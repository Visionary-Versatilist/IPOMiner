Some of the more significant risks are:•Our history of losses and that we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.•We have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects.•Our ability to accurately forecast customer demand and match production levels to customer orders.•We rely on third parties to manufacture, package, assemble and test the semiconductor components comprising our products.3Table of Contents•The market for our products is characterized by declines in average selling prices, which could negatively affect our revenue and margins.•We began selling our flash memory products in 2012 and have not generated a material amount of revenue from our CBRAM-based products, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current and future prospects.•Our growth depends on the growth and development of the emerging IoT industry, and if the market does not develop as we expect, our business prospects may be harmed.•We rely on our relationships with OEMs and ODMs to enhance our product offerings and market position, and our failure to continue to develop or maintain such relationships in the future would harm our ability to remain

Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus:•the receipt, reduction, delay or cancellation of orders by large customers;•the gain or loss of significant customers and distributors;•the timing and success of our launch of new or enhanced products and those of our competitors;•market acceptance of our products and our customers’ products;•the level of growth or decline in the IoT market;•the timing and extent of research and development and sales and marketing expenditures;15Table of Contents•the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;•changes in our product mix;•our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products;•competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices;•fluctuations in sales by and inventory levels of OEMs and ODMs who incorporate our memory products in their products;•cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our markets;•fluctuations in the manufacturing yields of our third-party contract manufacturers;•events that impact the availability of production capacity at our third-party subcontractors and other interruptions in the supply chain including due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, materials shortages,
