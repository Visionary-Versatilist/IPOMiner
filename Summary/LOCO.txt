Our ability to open new restaurants is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our or our franchisees’ ability to:•identify available and suitable restaurant sites;•compete for restaurant sites;•reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations;•obtain or have available the financing required to acquire and operate a restaurant, including construction and opening costs;•respond to unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with leased premises;•avoid the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities;•hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;•obtain, in a timely manner and for an acceptable cost, required licenses, permits and regulatory approvals and respond effectively to any changes in local, state or federal law and regulations that adversely affect our
At September 24, 2014, we had no other borrowings against our revolving credit facility.Our high level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, such as:•limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy and other purposes;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;•making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our ability to plan for and react to changing conditions;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and•exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.In addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it
Any of these competitive factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our marketing programs may not be successful, and our new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels may not
additional government regulations and new laws mandating increases in minimum wages or mandated benefits such as health insurance could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.
suspension on franchise sales, fines or the requirement that we make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could affect our ability to open new restaurants in the future and thus could materially adversely affect our business and operating
Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:•variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;•changes in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;•the contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;•additions or departures of key management personnel;•any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;•announcements by us or others and developments affecting us;•actions by institutional stockholders;•litigation and governmental investigations;•legislative or regulatory changes;•judicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;•changes in government programs;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•speculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and•general market, political and economic conditions, including local conditions in the markets in which we operate.These broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
