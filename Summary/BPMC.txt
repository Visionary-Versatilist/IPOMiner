needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, including the $15.0 million upfront payment received in March 2015 upon
defending intellectual property-related claims;•the extent to which we acquire or in-license other drug candidates and technologies.•the costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production; and•the costs of establishing or contracting for sales and marketing capabilities if we obtain regulatory clearances to market our drug
stock in this offering, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates.Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial drug revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of
The success of our drug candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:•successful completion of pre-clinical studies;•approval of Investigational New Drug applications, or INDs, for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials;•successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials;•successful development of companion diagnostics for use with our drug candidates;•receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers for clinical supply and
commercial manufacturing;•obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our drug candidates;•launching commercial sales of our drug candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•acceptance of the drug candidates, if and when approved, by patients, the medical community and third party payors;•effectively competing with other therapies;•obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement;•enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims; and•maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of the drug candidates following approval.If
any future clinical trials that we could conduct that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our drug candidates,
receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our drug candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient
enrollment may be affected by other factors including:•the severity of the disease under investigation;•the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question;•the availability of an appropriate genomic screening test;•the perceived risks and benefits of the drug candidate under study;•the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;•the patient referral practices of physicians;•the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and•the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients.19Table of ContentsGenomically defined diseases may have relatively low prevalence and it may be difficult to identify
approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.Undesirable side effects caused by our drug candidates could cause us to interrupt, delay or halt pre-clinical studies or could cause
that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or companion diagnostics or additional pricing pressures.If, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into
commercialize our drug candidates in foreign markets, we would be subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including:•our customers' ability to obtain reimbursement for our drug candidates in foreign markets;•our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties;•the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting and legal requirements;•different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;•import or export licensing requirements;•longer accounts receivable collection times;•longer lead times for shipping;•language barriers for technical training;•reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;•the existence of additional potentially relevant third-party intellectual property rights;•foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and•the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute.Foreign
