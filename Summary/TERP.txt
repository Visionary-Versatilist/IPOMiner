Concurrently with the closing of the Merger and Sponsorship Transaction, Brookfield and the Company entered into the new sponsorship agreements, which include, among other things, for Brookfield to provide strategic and investment management services to the Company, for Brookfield, subject to certain terms and conditions, to provide the Company with a right of first offer on certain operating wind and solar assets that are located in North America and Western Europe and developed by persons sponsored by or under the control of Brookfield and for Brookfield to provide TerraForm Power with a $500 million secured revolving credit facility to fund certain acquisitions or growth capital expenditures.The Company may not realize expected benefits of Brookfield’s management services and the other aspects of the sponsorship arrangements.
Any of these factors could cause our sites to have less wind or solar potential than we expected and may cause us to pay more for wind and solar power plants in connection with acquisitions than we otherwise would have paid had such mistakes not been made, which could cause the return on our investment in these wind and solar power plants to be lower than expected.If our wind and solar energy assessments turn out to be wrong, our business could suffer a number of material adverse consequences, including:•our energy production and sales may be significantly lower than we predict;•our hedging arrangements may be ineffective or more costly;•we may not produce sufficient energy to meet our commitments to sell electricity or RECs and, as a result, we may have to buy electricity or RECs on the open market to cover our obligations or pay damages; and•our wind and solar power plants may not generate sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal and interest as they become due on our outstanding debt, and we may have difficulty obtaining financing for future wind power plants.Our failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance withSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.We are required to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the course of preparing our financial statements, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year.
These control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be10TABLE OF CONTENTSprevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2017.The existence of these or other material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price.We are involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other regulatory proceedings which requiresignificant attention from our management, which involve a greater exposure to legal liability and may resultin significant damage awards and which may relate to the operations of our renewable energy facilities.We have been subject to claims arising out of our acquisition activities with respect to certain payments in connection with the acquisition of First Wind Holdings, LLC by SunEdison, as more fully described inNote 19.Commitments and Contingenciesto our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Furthermore, if the financial condition of these utilities and/or power purchasers deteriorated or our renewable portfolio standard (“RPS”) programs, climate change programs or other regulations to which they are currently subject and that compel them to source renewable energy supplies change, demand for electricity produced by our utility-scale facilities could be negatively impacted.Our hedging activities may not adequately manage our exposure to commodity and financial risk, which couldresult in significant losses or require us to use cash collateral to meet margin requirements, each of whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity,which could impair our ability to execute favorable financial hedges in the future.Certain of our wind power plants are party to financial swaps or other hedging arrangements.
Our failure, or the failure of any of our renewable energy facilities, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.29TABLE OF CONTENTSRisks Inherent in an Investment in TerraForm Power, Inc.We may not be able to pay cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the future.The amount of our cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•our ability to realize the expected benefits from Brookfield’s sponsorship on our business and results of operations;•any adverse consequences arising out of our separation from SunEdison and of the SunEdison Bankruptcy;•the timing of our ability to complete our audited corporate and project-level financial statements;•risks related to our ability to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC on a timely basis and to satisfy the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market;•our ability to integrate acquired assets and realize the anticipated benefits of these acquired assets;•counterparties’ to our offtake agreements willingness and ability to fulfill their obligations under such agreements;•price fluctuations, termination provisions and buyout provisions related to our offtake agreements;•our ability to enter into contracts to sell power on acceptable terms as our offtake agreements expire;•delays or unexpected costs during the completion of construction of certain renewable energy facilities we intend to acquire;•our ability to successfully identify, evaluate and consummate acquisitions;•government regulation, including compliance with regulatory and permit requirements and changes in market rules, rates, tariffs and environmental laws;•operating and financial restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries related to agreements governing our indebtedness and other agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and project-level subsidiaries generally;•our ability to borrow additional funds and access capital markets, as well as our substantial indebtedness and the possibility that we may incur additional indebtedness going forward;•our ability to compete against traditional and renewable energy companies;•hazards customary to the power production industry and power generation operations such as unusual weather conditions, catastrophic weather-related or other damage to facilities, unscheduled generation outages, maintenance or repairs, interconnection problems or other developments, environmental incidents, or electric transmission constraints and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses as a result of such hazards;•our ability to expand into new business segments or new geographies;•seasonal variations in the amount of electricity our wind and solar plants produce, and fluctuations in wind and solar resource conditions; and•our ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs tightly, manage litigation, manage risks related to international operations and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses in relation to our debt and other obligations.As a result of all these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock.
