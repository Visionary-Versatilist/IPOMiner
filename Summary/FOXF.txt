Our innovative product development and speed to market are supported by:•our racing culture, including on-site technical race support of professional athletes, which provides us with unique real-time insights as to the evolving ride dynamic needs of those participating in world-class events;•ongoing research and development through a team of full-time engineers and numerous other technicians and employees who spend at least part of their time testing and using our products and helping develop engineering-based solutions to enhance our product offerings;•feedback from professional athletes, race teams, enthusiasts and other consumers seeking to improve the performance and control of their vehicles through our products;-2-•strategic and collaborative relationships with OEM customers, which furthers our ability to extend technologies and applications across end-markets; and•our integrated manufacturing facilities and performance testing center, which allow us to quickly move from concept to product.Over the last year we have developed multiple new products and generated more than 70% of our sales from products introduced by us during the last three years, such as the:•Podium RC3, which provides external adjustment that allows the shock to easily be tuned for different rider skill, terrain, and racing type without having to be disassembled;•Float X Evol, which allows the rider to tune the spring characteristics of the shock via an air pump without having to remove the shock;•ECS Shock, which has an external cooling system that significantly lowers shock temperatures, allowing powered vehicles to operate at higher speeds for extended periods without sacrificing driver control, particularly in extreme environments; and•Float iCD, which provides riders the ability to adjust modes for different skills, terrains and activity levels on mountain bikes, resulting in increased utilization of the modes and an overall more efficient ride dynamics experience.Strategic brand for OEMs, dealers and distributorsThrough our strategic relationships, we are often sought out by our OEM customers and work closely with them to develop and design new products and product enhancements.
Some of these risks include:•we may not be able to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new products that respond to consumer needs and preferences and achieve market acceptance;-4-•we face intense competition across all product lines and may be unable to effectively compete against our competitors, which would harm our business and operating results;•our suspension products, and the products into which they are incorporated, are discretionary purchases and may be adversely impacted by changes in the economy and economic conditions that impact consumer spending;•if we are unable to maintain our premium brand image, our business may suffer;•our dependence on the demand for high-end mountain bikes and their suspension components to maintain and foster sales;•our dependence upon the expansion of the market for powered vehicles that require high-performance suspension systems to continue our growth in this product category;•a disruption in our operations or manufacturing facilities, including any disruption in connection with the transition of a majority of the manufacturing of our mountain bike products to Taiwan, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations;•we depend on the continuing efforts of our senior management and skilled engineers, and our business may be severely disrupted and adversely impacted if we lose their services; and•we depend on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales.Our historyRobert C.
We do not intend our use or display of other companies’ trade names or trademarks to imply a relationship with, or any endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other companies.Emerging growth company statusWe are an “emerging growth company,” as that term is defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. For as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we have taken, and may continue to take, advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that do not qualify as emerging growth companies, including, without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations relating to executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay,” “say-when-on-pay” and “golden parachute” executive compensation votes.Under the JOBS Act, we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of:•the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more;•the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO in August 2013;•the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or•the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act (i.e., the first day of the fiscal year after we have (i) more than $700 million in outstanding common equity held by our non-affiliates, measured each year on the last day of our second fiscal quarter, and (ii) been public for at least 12 months).The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
