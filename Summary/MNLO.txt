We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.4THE OFFERINGIssuerMenlo Therapeutics Inc.Common stock offered by us6,500,000 shares.Common stock to be outstandingafter the offering21,427,998 shares.Underwriters’ option to purchaseadditional shares975,000 shares.Use of proceedsWe estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately $98.2 million, or approximately $113.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, at the assumed initial public offering price of $16.50 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering: (i) to complete our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of serlopitant for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and for refractory chronic cough; (ii) to significantly advance our planned Phase 3 development of serlopitant for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis; (iii) to supply serlopitant for our clinical trials and for development and validation of our commercial manufacturing process for serlopitant in preparation for our NDA and Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, submissions; (iv) $3.0 million for a milestone payment to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., or Merck, associated with initiating a Phase 3 clinical trial; and (v) the remainder for personnel expenses, other development activities, including potentially commencing Phase 3 clinical trials for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and for refractory chronic cough, working capital, and other general corporate purposes, including the costs of operating as a public company.
In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:▪the time and cost necessary to complete our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and for refractory chronic cough, our planned Phase 3 clinical trials for pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis as well as any additional current and planned clinical trials of serlopitant;▪the number, size and type of any additional clinical trials or studies we may choose to initiate or that we may be required to complete prior to obtaining regulatory approval of serlopitant;▪the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we current expect, and the costs of post‑marketing studies that could be required by regulatory authorities;▪our ability to receive payments under our collaboration with Japan Tobacco Inc. and Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, together referred to as JT Torii, and the timing of receipt of any such payments;▪the timing of the milestone payments we must make to Merck;▪the costs of preparing to manufacture serlopitant on a commercial scale;▪our ability to successfully commercialize serlopitant;▪the manufacturing, selling and marketing costs associated with serlopitant, including the cost and timing of forming and expanding our sales organization and marketing capabilities;▪the amount of sales and other revenues from serlopitant, including the sales price and the availability of adequate third‑party reimbursement;▪the degree and rate of market acceptance of any products launched by us or our partners;▪the cash requirements of any future acquisitions or discovery of product candidates;▪the progress, timing, scope and costs of our non‑clinical studies and clinical trials, including the ability to enroll patients in a timely manner in potential future clinical trials;▪the time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;▪the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;▪our need and ability to hire additional personnel;▪our ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, commercialization or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements; and10▪the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all.
The clinical and commercial success of serlopitant will depend on a number of factors, including the following:▪the timely completion of and results from our three ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and for refractory chronic cough;▪the initiation of and results from our planned Phase 3 clinical trials of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis;▪the initiation of and results from any Phase 3 clinical trials, if conducted, in pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, pruritus associated with psoriasis, or refractory chronic cough;▪whether the FDA disagrees with the number, design, size, conduct, or implementation of our planned and future clinical trials;▪our ability to demonstrate serlopitant’s safety and efficacy to treat pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, with psoriasis or with prurigo nodularis or to treat refractory chronic cough to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;▪the timely completion and results of any additional clinical trials and non‑clinical studies conducted to support the filing for regulatory approvals of serlopitant;▪whether we are required by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials prior to approval to market serlopitant for any indication;▪our ability to execute on our clinical trial plans and monitor the conduct of the studies by the contract research organizations, or CROs, and medical institutions;▪the prevalence, frequency and severity of adverse side effects of serlopitant;▪the timely receipt of necessary marketing approvals from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities to treat pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis or prurigo nodularis, or to treat refractory chronic cough;▪our ability to raise sufficient additional capital to fund development, manufacturing and commercialization activities for serlopitant;▪our ability to successfully commercialize serlopitant, if approved for marketing and sale by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, whether alone or in collaboration with others;11▪the ability of our third‑party manufacturers to manufacture quantities of serlopitant using commercially sufficient processes at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and at a cost appropriate for our commercialization;▪the ability of our third‑party manufacturers to comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP;▪achieving and maintaining compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to serlopitant;▪our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of serlopitant;▪the willingness of physicians and patients to utilize or adopt serlopitant;▪the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;▪our ability to obtain and sustain an adequate level of reimbursement for serlopitant by third‑party payors;▪the effectiveness of our own, our current collaborator’s, or any future strategic collaborators’ marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;▪our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights in and to serlopitant;▪our ability to avoid third‑party patent interference or patent infringement claims;▪a continued acceptable safety profile of serlopitant following approval; and▪emerging safety signals from other drugs generally perceived to be in the same drug class as serlopitant, including NK1-R antagonists.Many of these factors are beyond our control.
We are developing a pediatric plan for review with regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States.In12September 2017, the FDA authorized us to proceed with our Phase 2 clinical trial in refractory chronic cough under a separate IND for this indication.We enrolled the first patients in the trial in October 2017 and we expect data from this trial to be available in late 2018 or early 2019.We may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of our non‑clinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize serlopitant, including:▪regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;▪we may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;▪the number of subjects required for clinical trials of serlopitant may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or participants may drop out of these clinical trials or fail to return for post‑treatment follow‑up at a higher rate than we anticipate;▪serlopitant may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or institutional review boards to suspend or terminate the trials;▪our third‑party contractors and clinical trial sites may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;▪regulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the trial subjects are being exposed to unacceptable risks; and▪the supply or quality of serlopitant or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our drug candidates may be insufficient or inadequate.We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the institutional review boards of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities.
Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations.When entering collaboration arrangements, such as that with JT Torii, we are subject to a number of risks, including:▪collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial or abandon products, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, require a new formulation of products for clinical testing, may decide not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to their acquisition of competitive products or their internal development of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;▪any safety issues or adverse side effects that result from trials conducted by a collaborator will adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for serlopitant or any other product we may develop in the future;▪any failure by a collaborator to demonstrate efficacy of serlopitant, or any potential future product candidate, in its clinical trials could decrease the perceived likelihood of success for our clinical trials;▪disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding clinical development and commercialization matters may lead to delays in the development process or commercializing the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement;▪collaboration arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement, and we may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we so chose to enter into such arrangements;19▪collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party and any such termination or expiration would adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation;▪collaboration agreements may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in delays or the need for a new collaborator or additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of serlopitant or other future product candidates in certain markets;▪collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates;▪terms of any collaborations or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us;▪we could grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;▪we will face, to the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators;▪collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and other third parties often are terminated or allowed to expire by the other party and any such termination or expiration could adversely affect us financially and could harm our business reputation;▪collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;▪collaborators may own or co‑own intellectual property covering products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property;▪disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of any intellectual property developed pursuant to our collaborations;▪collaborators’ sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws resulting in civil or criminal proceedings;▪adverse regulatory determinations or other legal action may interfere with the ability of a collaborator to conduct clinical trials or other development activity;▪one or more collaborator may be subject to regulatory or legal action resulting from the failure to meet healthcare industry compliance requirements in the conduct of clinical trials or the promotion and sale of products; and▪collaboration arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in collaborators’ key management personnel and other personnel that are administering collaboration agreements.Additionally, JT Torii will be conducting clinical trials of serlopitant under our collaboration agreement.If serious adverse events or other undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics of serlopitant, are observed in these trials, it may adversely affect or delay our clinical development of serlopitant, and the occurrence of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business.We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing drugs before or more successfully than we do.The biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is subject to rapid and significant change.
If we chose to commercialize internationally, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks, including:▪different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;▪differing United States and foreign drug import and export rules;24▪different protection for intellectual property rights in foreign countries;▪unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;▪different reimbursement systems, and different competitive drugs indicated to treat pruritus and refractory chronic cough;▪economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;▪compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;▪foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;▪foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;▪workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;▪production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;▪potential liability resulting from development work conducted by these distributors; and▪business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of serlopitant or any future product candidates that we may develop.We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of serlopitant in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we sell commercially any drugs that we may develop.
