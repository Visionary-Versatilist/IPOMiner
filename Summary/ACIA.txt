The loss or temporary loss of ZTE as a result of this or future regulatory activity could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.We may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our larger customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger
Our successful product development depends on a number of factors, including the following:•the accurate prediction of market requirements, changes in technology and evolving standards;•the availability of qualified product designers and technologies needed to solve difficult design challenges in a cost-effective, reliable manner;13Table of Contents•our ability to design products that meet customers’ cost, size, acceptance and specification criteria and performance requirements;•our ability to manufacture new products with acceptable quality and manufacturing yields in a sufficient quantity to meet customer demand and according to customer needs;•our ability to offer new products at competitive prices;•our dependence on suppliers to deliver in a timely manner materials that are critical components of our products;•our dependence on third-party manufacturers to successfully manufacture our products;•the identification of and entry into new markets for our products;•the acceptance of our customers’ products by the market and the lifecycle of such products; and•our ability to deliver products in a timely manner within our customers’ product planning and deployment cycle.A new product development effort may last two years or longer, and requires significant investments in engineering hours, third-party development costs,
new manufacturers or foundries and/or move existing internal or external production lines to new manufacturers or foundries, we could experience supply disruptions during the transition process.Because we rely on contract manufacturers and foundries, we face several significant risks in addition to those discussed above, including:•a lack of guaranteed supply of manufactured wafers and other raw and finished components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraints;14Table of Contents•the limited availability of, or potential delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies;•the location of contract manufacturers and foundries in regions that are subject to earthquakes, typhoons, tsunamis and other natural disasters; and•competition with our contract manufacturers’ or foundries’ other customers when contract manufacturers or foundries allocate capacity or supply during periods of capacity constraint or supply shortages.The manufacture of our products is a complex and technologically demanding process that utilizes many state of the art manufacturing
Such remediation could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.We generate a significant portion of our revenue from international sales and therefore are subject to additional risks associated with our international
financial statements;•certification requirements;•greater difficulty documenting and testing our internal controls;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•potentially adverse tax consequences;•the effects of changes in currency exchange rates;•changes in service provider and government spending patterns;•social, political and economic instability;•higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices that could expose us to liability or damage our reputation; and•natural disasters, health epidemics and acts of war or terrorism.17Table of ContentsInternational customers may also require that we comply with additional testing or customization of our
If our sales cycles lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.If we fail to accurately predict market requirements or market demand for our products, our business, competitive position and operating results will suffer.We operate in a dynamic industry and use significant resources to develop new products for existing and new markets.

In addition, in any future economic downturn or periods of inflationary increase we may be unable to reduce our costs quickly enough to maintain profitability levels.Our business is subject to currency fluctuations that have adversely affected our results of operations in recent quarters and may continue to do so in the
Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;•actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;•announcements of technological innovations, new products, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;•announcements by our customers regarding significant increases or decreases in capital expenditures;•departure of key personnel;•litigation involving us or that may be perceived as having an impact on our business;•changes in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends, including the economic slowdown in China that began in 2015 and the uncertainty arising from the June 2016 referendum vote in the United Kingdom in
