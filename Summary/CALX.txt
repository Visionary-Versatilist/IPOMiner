Telephone Company, or Ericsson, Motorola, Inc., Occam Networks, Inc., Tellabs, Inc. and Zhone Technologies, Inc. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including:Ÿthe successful development of new products;Ÿour ability to anticipate CSP and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards;Ÿour ability to differentiate our products from our competitors’ offerings based on performance, cost-effectiveness or other factors;Ÿour ability to gain customer acceptance of our products; andŸour ability to market and sell our products.The market for broadband access equipment is dominated primarily by large, established vendors.
