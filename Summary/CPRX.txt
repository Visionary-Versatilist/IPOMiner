We believe that we control all current intellectual property for drugs that have a mechanism of action related to inhibition of GABA aminotransferase.We are currently involved in the following product development activities: (i) we are jointly conducting with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the Veterans Administration (VA) a U.S. Phase II(b) clinical trial evaluating CPP-109 for the treatment of cocaine addiction (and, based on current information, we expect to obtain top line results from this trial early in the first quarter of 2013); and (ii) we are conducting a
There can be no assurance that the data from our ongoing Phase II(b) trial will be sufficiently compelling or that even if such data are sufficiently compelling, that the FDA will file an NDA submitted for CPP-109 based on the results of that trial.Our StrategyOur strategy is to become a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in-licensing and development of proprietary drug
$             per share of common stock, subject to adjustment.The warrants will be exercisable during the period commencing on the date of original issuance and ending five years from such date.Use of ProceedsWe intend to use the net proceeds of this offering: (i) to fund the activities necessary to support the submission of an NDA for CPP-109 for FDA approval and to prepare for the commercial launch
additional funding to complete studies or trials other than those described above, including any Phase III clinical trial that we may be required to complete before we are in a position to file an NDA for CPP-109 for cocaine addiction and any
contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;•our tests may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional testing; and•the costs of our pre-clinical and/or clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate.Vigabatrin has known side effects that may hinder our ability to produce safe and commercially viable products.When used long-term as a treatment for epilepsy, a formulation of vigabatrin known as Sabril®has been found to cause the development of peripheral visual field defects, known as VFDs, which increase
We could be required, before obtaining marketing approval for CPP-109 for additional indications, to conduct substantial new research and development activities, which could be more costly and time-consuming than we currently
We may be required to conduct costly, post-marketing follow-up studies if FDA requests additional information.Our receipt of Fast Track status does not mean that our product development efforts will be accelerated.The FDA has granted Fast Track designation to CPP-109 and to CPP-115 for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
or our clinical studies and trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, our ability to commercialize our products will be impaired.Before we can obtain regulatory approval for the sale of any of our product candidates, we may have to conduct, at our own expense, pre-clinical tests in animals in order to support the safety of CPP-109
manufacturing regulations, our ability to develop and commercialize our products could suffer significant interruptions and delays.Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured the product ourselves, including:•reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;•reliance on the continued financial viability of the third parties;•limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of the third parties;13Table of Contents•impact on our reputation in the marketplace if manufacturers of our products, once commercialized, fail to meet the demands of our customers;•the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and•the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or
regulations applicable to our proposed products or the interpretation thereof might change and thereby prevent us from marketing some or all of our products and services for a period of time or indefinitely.Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third PartiesWe are dependent on our relationship and license agreements with Brookhaven and Northwestern University, and we rely upon the patent rights granted to us for vigabatrin and CPP-115 pursuant to the
Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:•developments concerning our clinical studies and trials and our pre-clinical studies;19Table of Contents•announcements of product development successes and failures by us or our competitors;•new products introduced or announced by us or our competitors;•adverse changes in the abilities of our third-party manufacturers to provide drug or product in a timely manner or to meet FDA requirements;•changes in reimbursement levels;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;•actual or anticipated variations in operating results;•expiration or termination of licenses (particularly our licenses from Brookhaven and Northwestern), research contracts or other collaboration
us to seek and obtain approval of NDAs for CPP-109 and CPP-115;•the expense of filing, and potentially prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other individual property rights;•whether others develop and commercialize products competitive to our products;•changes in the laws and regulations affecting our business;•our ability to attract and retain skilled employees; and•changes in general economic conditions and interest rates.Our current plans and objectives are based on assumptions relating to the development of our current product candidates.
