We expect sales from this channel to continue to grow as consumers become more aware of our e-commerce capabilities and we open boutiques in new markets.•Enhance Operating Margins.Our strong expected boutique growth should permit us to take advantage of economies of scale in merchandising and sourcing and to also leverage our existing infrastructure, corporate overhead and other fixed costs.Summary Risk FactorsWe are subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.
Risks relating to our business include, among others:•we may not be able to effectively anticipate, identify and respond quickly to changing fashion trends and customer preferences;•we may not be able to execute our growth strategy if we are unable to identify suitable locations to open new boutiques, obtain favorable lease terms, attract customers to our boutiques, hire and retain personnel and maintain sufficient levels of cash flow to support our expansion;•the company has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the past, which related to accounting for convertible redeemable preferred stock.

As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.Risks Related to Our BusinessOur success depends on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond quickly to new and changing fashion trends, customer preferences and other factors, and our inability to anticipate, identify and respond to these changes and trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our core market, apparel, jewelry, accessories and gifts for women from 18 to 35-years old, is subject to rapidly shifting fashion trends, customer tastes and demands.
Any of our vendors could discontinue supplying us with desired products in sufficient quantities for a variety of reasons.The benefits we currently experience from our vendor relationships could be adversely affected if our vendors:•choose to stop providing merchandise samples to us or otherwise discontinue selling merchandise to us;•raise the prices they charge us;•change pricing terms to require us to pay on delivery or upfront, including as a result of changes in the credit relationships some of our vendors have with their various lending institutions;•reduce our access to styles, brands and merchandise by entering into broad exclusivity arrangements with our competitors or otherwise in the marketplace;•sell similar merchandise to our competitors with similar or better pricing, many of whom already purchase merchandise in significantly greater volume and, in some cases, at lower prices than we do;•lengthen their lead times; or•initiate or expand sales of apparel and accessories to retail customers directly through their own stores, catalogs or on the internet and compete with us directly.20TABLE OF CONTENTSWe historically have established good working relationships with many small- to mid-size vendors that often have more limited resources, production capacities and operating histories.
In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:•fashion trends and changes in consumer preferences;•changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the retail sales environment;•the timing and level of expenses for new boutique openings, relocations and remodels and the relative proportion of our new boutiques to existing boutiques;•the performance and successful integration of any new boutiques that we open;•the success of our e-commerce business and sales levels;•changes in our merchandise mix and vendor base;•changes in key personnel;•entry into new markets;•our levels of comparable boutique sales;•announcements by us or our competitors of new product offerings or significant acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;•actions by competitors or other mall, lifestyle center, street locations and strip center tenants;•weather conditions, particularly during the holiday shopping period;•the level of pre-opening expenses associated with new boutiques;•inventory shrinkage beyond our historical average rates;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retail companies;30TABLE OF CONTENTS•investors’ perceptions of our prospects and the prospects of the retail industry;•fluctuations in quarterly operating results, as well as differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors;•the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;•announcements relating to litigation;•guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;•changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our common stock;•the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our common stock;•investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;•future sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders;•other events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, hurricanes, war, acts of terrorism, other natural disasters or responses to these events; and•changes in accounting principles.These and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
