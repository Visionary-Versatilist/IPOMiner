Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences, including the following:•our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments;•we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms, which could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to meet operational needs;•we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness;•we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties, possibly on unfavorable terms or in violation of certain covenants to which we may be subject;•we may violate financial covenants in our loan documents, which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations; and•our default under any loan with cross default provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness.If any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common
could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock.As of June 30, 2014, leases representing approximately 5.58% of the square footage and approximately 7.50% of the annualized base rent of the

financial expectations, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock.Our future acquisitions and our ability to successfully operate the properties we acquire in such acquisitions may be exposed to the following
existing in the future, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock as a result of the following potential consequences, among others:•decreased demand for retail space, which would cause market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;•reduced values of our properties may limit our ability to dispose of assets at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by our properties and may reduce the availability of unsecured loans; and•our ability to obtain financing on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce our ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities and refinance existing debt,
properties in order to retain and attract tenants, causing our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock to be adversely affected.To the extent adverse economic conditions continue in the real estate market and demand for retail space falls, we expect that, upon expiration

we will be subject to the following risks associated with such development and redevelopment activities:•unsuccessful development or redevelopment opportunities could result in direct expenses to us;•construction or redevelopment costs of a project may exceed original estimates, possibly making the project less profitable than originally estimated, or unprofitable;•time required to complete the construction or redevelopment of a project or to lease up the completed project may be greater than originally anticipated, thereby adversely affecting our cash flow and liquidity;•contractor and subcontractor disputes, strikes, labor disputes or supply disruptions;•failure to achieve expected occupancy and/or rent levels within the projected time frame, if at all;•delays with respect to obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary zoning, occupancy, land use and other governmental permits, and changes in zoning and land use laws;•occupancy rates and rents of a completed project may not be sufficient to make the project profitable;•our ability to dispose of properties developed or redeveloped with the intent to sell could be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain financing given the current state of the credit markets; and•the availability and pricing of financing to fund our development activities on favorable terms or at all.These risks could result in substantial unanticipated delays or expenses and, under certain circumstances, could prevent completion of
properties described in this prospectus and otherwise in the ordinary course of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share trading price of our common stock.We may be subject to on-going litigation, including existing claims relating to the entities that own the properties and operate
