multiple proprietary anti-CSC product candidates, five of which are in clinical development, with additional IND filings anticipated in future years.nAdvance demcizumab (OMP-21M18) to determine its utility as a treatment for solid tumors.We are conducting Phase Ib trials of demcizumab in
Our current efforts on our demcizumab, OMP-59R5, OMP-52M51, vantictumab and OMP-54F28 product candidates could potentially lead to development of future companion diagnostics.nUtilize pharmaceutical collaborations as appropriate to provide funding, create value and leverage partners’ expertise to bring medicines to patients.We believe that our GSK and Bayer collaborations have provided validation of our scientific approach, significant funding to advance our pipeline and access to development and commercial expertise for our partnered assets.
These risks include, among others:nour dependence on the successful development of our programs and our product candidates;nany need to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to side effects or other safety risks, or any need to conduct studies on the long-term effects associated

adverse side effects with our existing and future product candidates, including demcizumab.15Table of ContentsThe pharmacokinetic profile of preclinical studies may not be indicative of results in any clinical trial.
In addition, if we are unable to achieve anticipated research or development milestones, and to obtain the applicable milestone payments, for any product candidate under our collaboration agreements with GSK and Bayer, we are
Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:nthe rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;nthe timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals;nthe continuation and success of our strategic alliances with GSK and Bayer and future collaboration partners, including the exercise or non-exercise of further
the results of such litigation;nour ability to enter into additional collaboration, licensing, government or other arrangements and the terms and timing of such arrangements;nthe potential need to acquire, by acquisition or in-licensing, other products or technologies; andnthe emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market developments.Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies.
through completion of Phase I trials, GSK is entitled to exercise an option to obtain an exclusive license for further development and commercialization of the applicable product candidate on a worldwide basis.Under the agreement with GSK, we are eligible to receive from GSK, (1) with respect to OMP-59R5, aggregate payments of up to $344.5 million, including an
