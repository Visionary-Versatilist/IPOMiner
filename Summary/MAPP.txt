Administration, or the FDA, to perform studies in addition to those we currently anticipate, our expenses will increase beyond expectations and the timing of any potential product approval may be delayed.
fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this prospectus:Ÿour ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates;8Table of ContentsŸthe need to obtain regulatory approval of our two most advanced product candidates, Unit Dose Budesonide, or UDB, for pediatric asthma, and MAP0004 for migraine;Ÿdelays in the commencement, enrollment, and the timing of, clinical testing;Ÿthe success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;Ÿthe success of clinical trials of our UDB and MAP0004 product candidates or future product candidates;Ÿany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;Ÿour ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our products;Ÿpotential side effects of our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;Ÿregulatory difficulties relating to products that have already received regulatory approval;Ÿmarket acceptance of our product candidates;Ÿour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;Ÿcompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;Ÿthe impact of competition in the pediatric asthma market on our ability to commercialize UDB;Ÿthe impact of competition in the migraine market on the commercialization of MAP0004;Ÿguidelines and recommendations of therapies published by various organizations;Ÿthe ability of patients to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for our products;Ÿpotential product liability claims;Ÿpotential liabilities associated with hazardous materials;Ÿour ability to maintain adequate insurance policies;Ÿour dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our products;Ÿour ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;Ÿour ability and third parties’ abilities to protect intellectual property rights;Ÿcosts related to and outcomes of potential intellectual property litigation;Ÿcompliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;Ÿour ability to adequately support future growth;Ÿour ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively; andŸthe level of experience in running a public company of our senior management who are new to their current roles.Due to the various factors mentioned above, and others, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of
Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:Ÿthe scope, rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities;Ÿthe costs and timing of regulatory approval;Ÿthe costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;Ÿthe effect of competing technological and market developments;Ÿthe terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;Ÿthe cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale outsourced manufacturing activities; andŸthe costs of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.Risks Relating to the Development, Regulatory Approval andCommercialization of Our Product CandidatesWe are largely dependent on the success of our
development programs for UDB and MAP0004 may not lead to regulatory approval from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies if we fail to demonstrate that the product candidates are safe and effective in our planned clinical trials, and
longer or additional clinical trials that may result in substantial additional expense and a delay or failure in obtaining approval or approval for a more limited indication than originally sought.Our failure to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of UDB, MAP0004 or any other product candidates would prevent regulatory approval and,
Any delays in the regulatory review or approval of our products in development would delay market launch, increase our cash requirements and result in additional operating losses.The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals, including foreign approvals, often takes many years and can vary substantially based
make following FDA approval;Ÿlimitations inherent in the approved indication for any of our product candidates compared to more commonly understood or addressed conditions;Ÿlower demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products;Ÿprevalence and severity of adverse effects;Ÿineffective marketing and distribution efforts;Ÿlack of availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors;Ÿlack of cost-effectiveness;Ÿtiming of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products;Ÿavailability of alternative therapies at similar costs;Ÿpatients’ potential preferences to take oral medications over inhaled medications; andŸpotential product liability claims.Our ability to effectively promote and sell our product candidates in the marketplace will also depend on pricing and cost effectiveness, including our ability to manufacture a product at a competitive price.
These risks and uncertainties include, among others:Ÿour ability to obtain additional funding to develop our product candidates;Ÿthe need to obtain regulatory approval of our two most advanced product candidates, Unit Dose Budesonide, or UDB, for pediatric asthma and MAP0004 for migraine;Ÿdelays in the commencement, enrollment, and the timing of, clinical testing;Ÿthe success of our clinical trials through all phases of clinical development;Ÿthe success of clinical trials of our UDB and MAP0004 product candidates or future product candidates;Ÿany delays in regulatory review and approval of product candidates in clinical development;Ÿour ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our products;Ÿpotential side effects of our future products that could delay or prevent commercialization or cause an approved drug to be taken off the market;Ÿregulatory difficulties relating to products that have already received regulatory approval;Ÿmarket acceptance of our product candidates;Ÿour ability to establish an effective sales and marketing infrastructure;Ÿcompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;Ÿthe impact of competition in the pediatric asthma market on our ability to commercialize UDB;Ÿthe impact of competition in the migraine market on the commercialization of MAP0004;Ÿguidelines and recommendations of therapies published by various organizations;Ÿthe ability of patients to obtain coverage of or sufficient reimbursement for our products;Ÿpotential product liability claims;Ÿpotential liabilities associated with hazardous materials;Ÿour ability to maintain adequate insurance policies;Ÿour dependency on third-party manufacturers to supply or manufacture our products;Ÿour ability to establish or maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;Ÿour ability and third parties’ abilities to protect intellectual property rights;Ÿcosts related to and outcomes of potential intellectual property litigation;Ÿcompliance with obligations under intellectual property licenses with third parties;Ÿour ability to adequately support future growth;Ÿour ability to attract and retain key personnel to manage our business effectively; and28Table of ContentsŸthe level of experience in running a public company of our senior management who are new to their current roles.Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts.
If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $78.1 million.The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development activities, including clinical trials for our internal development programs primarily related to our most advanced product candidates UDB and
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical development programs, especially UDB and MAP0004, and the amount and timing of revenues, if any, from any future collaborations.Until we use the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.
