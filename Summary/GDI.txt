Some examples of the improvement achieved from 2014 to 2016 include:•growing our Energy and Medical Segment Revenue by mid-single digit growth rates, excluding in each case the impact of the significant downturn in the upstream energy market and currency volatility;•growing Segment Adjusted EBITDA and meaningfully expanding Segment Adjusted EBITDA margins each year across all of our segments, excluding the impact of the significant downturn in the upstream energy market and currency volatility;•strengthening our customer service and connectivity by transitioning our sales team and realigning our product engineering and marketing teams in our Industrials segment into an integrated, global product and customer management structure;•transforming our upstream energy offering from being predominantly a pump manufacturer into a full service solutions provider that offers high quality, locally accessible aftermarket support; and•expanding our Industrials segment aftermarket revenues as a percentage of Industrials Segment Revenue from approximately 33% in 2014 to 35% in 2016.We believe the establishment and continued execution of our operational and strategic growth initiatives have positioned our Company for substantial revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth with continued potential to expand margins.
In APAC, despite recent deceleration, GDP growth remains robust, and we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from future growth in the region, which is estimated by the IMF to be a multiple of anticipated growth in the Americas and EMEA through 2018.Furthermore, key industry trends that we believe will drive continued growth for our Industrials business are: (i) continuing customer desire for innovation and new technologies; (ii) increasing demand for service and monitoring; (iii) growing focus on comprehensive solutions and total life cycle cost; (iv) rising need for adaptability of products to accommodate new applications; and (v) increasing customer expectations for product reliability combined with superior customer service, quick aftermarket support and regular maintenance to reduce downtime.EnergyOur Energy segment is one of the largest suppliers of equipment and associated aftermarket parts, consumables and services for the energy market applications that we serve, spanning upstream (petroleum exploration and production), midstream (transport, storage and wholesale marketing of petroleum products), downstream (refining, marketing and distribution of petroleum products) and petrochemical end-markets.
Further, we believe that overall demand for flow control products and services in the medical space will benefit from attractive secular growth trends, including: (i) aging demographics requiring greater access to medical care; (ii) growth in emerging economies with increased awareness of medical services and greater availability of treatment options; (iii) rising investment in health solutions and safety infrastructures driving demand for medical pump products; (iv) stronger demand for higher healthcare efficiency requiring premium and high performance systems; and (v) increasing demand for durable medical equipment providing significant opportunity for pump products to be incorporated into new applications.Our Business Transformation from Operational Execution and Strategic InvestmentOur top priorities since the KKR Transaction have been creating a performance-driven organization and ensuring superior execution of our operating initiatives in order to transform our business and realize step-change improvements in our commercial and operational capabilities, financial characteristics and performance, pace of innovation and customer service.
As a result of our investments, as well as our estimated leading global frac pump market position based on new unit sales in the last four years, we believe that we are even better positioned to capture market share and grow revenues and Segment Adjusted EBITDA independent of the upstream energy cycle, while positioning ourselves to realize significantly increased sales, profitability and customer responsiveness in the context of the current upstream energy recovery.Highly Attractive Financial ProfileWe participate in markets with attractive near- and long-term growth trends, and our business generates strong Adjusted EBITDA margins.
Across all three of our segments, our comprehensive strategy to drive strong revenue and earnings growth is centered on five primary objectives: (i) enhancing commercial leadership by expanding our sales and service presence, adding product line adjacencies and accelerating our innovation funnel; (ii) driving aftermarket sales penetration of our large installed base; (iii) further improving our competitive position with our customers through salesforce effectiveness programs; (iv) executing our operational excellence initiatives to streamline our cost structure and support margin expansion, including through manufacturing footprint optimization, administrative expense efficiency and strategic sourcing; and (v) pursuing acquisitions focused on bolstering our product offerings and/or geographic or market presence.
A significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.•Potential governmental regulations restricting the use, and increased public attention to and litigation regarding the impacts, of hydraulic fracturing or other processes on which it relies could reduce demand for our products.•We face competition in the markets we serve, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.•Large or rapid increases in the cost of raw materials and component parts, substantial decreases in their availability, or our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials and component parts could materially and adversely affect our operating results.•Our operating results could be adversely affected by a loss or reduction of business with key customers or consolidation or the vertical integration of our customer base.•Our ongoing and expected restructuring plans and other cost savings initiatives may not be as effective as we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the cost savings and increased efficiencies that we expect to result from these actions.
