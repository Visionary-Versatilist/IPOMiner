We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:•initiate or continue clinical studies of our three most advanced product candidates;•continue the research and development of our product candidates;•seek to discover or in-license additional product candidates;•seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies;•establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities to commercialize products for which we may obtain
regulatory approval, including process improvements in order to manufacture Andexanet alfa, formerly PRT4445, at commercial scale; and•enhance operational, financial and information management systems and hire more personnel, including personnel to support development of our product
requirements, the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers;•expenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;•the level of demand for our product candidates, should they receive approval, which may vary significantly;•future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies;•the timing and success or failure of clinical studies for our product candidates or competing product candidates, or any other change in the
Our future financing requirements will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:•the rate of progress and cost of our clinical studies;•the timing of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities;•the costs of commercialization activities if any of our product candidates is approved, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and
particularly Andexanet alfa;•receipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States for our product candidates;•establishing commercial manufacturing arrangements with third parties;•ability to manufacture product at commercially acceptable costs;•launching commercial sales of any product candidate that may be approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;•acceptance of any approved product by the medical community, third-party payors and patients;•effectively competing with other therapies;15Table of Contents•a continued acceptable safety profile of the product following approval; and•obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully
may approve it with restrictions on the label, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.Assuming the success of our APEX study, we anticipate seeking regulatory approval for Betrixaban in the United States for extended duration VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients for up to 35
The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;•the price we charge for our product candidates;•the willingness of physicians to change their current treatment practices;•the willingness of hospitals and hospital systems to include our product candidates as treatment options;20Table of Contents•convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;•the strength of marketing and distribution support; and•the availability of third-party coverage or reimbursement.For example, while there are no approved therapies for VTE prophylaxis in acute medically ill patients approved for use beyond the typical hospitalization period, there are therapies available for
United States, we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:•different regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights;•unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;•economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business
