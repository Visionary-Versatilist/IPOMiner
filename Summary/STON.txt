established necessary cash reserves.15Our indebtedness limits cash flow available for our operations and for distribution to our partners.15Adverse conditions in the financial markets may reduce the principal and earnings of the investments held in merchandise and perpetual care trusts and adversely affect our revenues and cash flow.15Pre-need sales typically generate low or negative cash flow in the periods immediately following sales.16Because fixed costs are inherent in our business, a decrease in our revenues can have a disproportionate effect on our cash flow and profits.16Our failure to attract and retain qualified sales personnel and management could have an adverse effect on us.16We may not be able to identify, complete, fund or successfully integrate additional cemetery acquisitions.17If the trend toward cremation in the United States continues, our revenues may decline.17Regulatory and Legal Risks17If state laws or interpretations of existing state laws change or if new laws are enacted, we may be required to increase trust deposits or to alter the timing of withdrawals from trusts, which may have a negative impact on
our revenues and cash flow.17If state laws or their interpretations change, or new laws are enacted relating to the ownership of cemeteries and funeral homes, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.17We are subject to legal restrictions on our marketing practices that could adversely affect the volume of our sales.18We are subject to environmental and health and safety regulations that may adversely affect our operating results.18Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us18Our general partner and its affiliates have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties, which may permit them to favor their own interests to your detriment.18Following the completion of this offering, affiliates of our general partner will own sufficient common and subordinated units to block any attempt to remove our general partner.19Unitholders have limited voting rights.19Our general partner can transfer its ownership interest in us without unitholder consent under certain circumstances, and the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder
consent.19You will experience immediate and substantial dilution of $6.64 per common unit.20We may issue additional common units without your approval, which would dilute your existing ownership interests.20Cost reimbursements due our general partner may be substantial and will reduce the cash available for distribution to you.20iTable of ContentsIn establishing cash reserves, our general partner may reduce the amount of available cash for distribution to you.20Our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price.21You may be required to repay distributions that you have received from us.21Tax Risks to Common Unitholders21We may have tax liabilities related to periods before our initial public offering and less net operating losses available to reduce taxable income and therefore tax liabilities for future periods.21Changes in the ownership of our units, including the changes occurring as a result of this offering, may result in annual limitations on our use of net operating losses available to reduce taxable income, which could increase
units.24You will likely be subject to state and local taxes in states where you do not live as a result of an investment in units.24USE OF PROCEEDS25CAPITALIZATION26DILUTION27CASH DISTRIBUTION POLICY28Quarterly Distributions of Available Cash28Operating Surplus and Capital Surplus28Distributions of Available Cash from Operating Surplus30Distributions of Available Cash from Capital Surplus30Subordination Period31Adjustment of Minimum Quarterly Distribution and Target Distribution Levels32Distributions of Cash Upon Liquidation33CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION34Pro Forma, As Adjusted Available Cash from Operating Surplus for 2003 and the First Half of 200434Estimated Available Cash from Operating Surplusthrough September 30, 200535SELECTED HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA37iiTable of ContentsMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS43Overview43Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates53Results of Operations55Liquidity and Capital Resources61Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements70Inflation70Seasonality70Recent Accounting Pronouncements70Quantitative and Qualitative Market Risk Disclosure71INDUSTRY OVERVIEW73General73Industry Characteristics73BUSINESS75Our Partnership75Business Strategies75Business Strengths77Operations78Sales Contracts80Trusts80Sales Personnel, Training and Marketing80Properties81Competition83Regulation84Environmental Regulations and Liabilities85Employees86Legal Proceedings86MANAGEMENT87StoneMor GP LLC Will Manage Us87Directors and Executive Officers of StoneMor GP LLC88Reimbursement of Expenses of our General Partner90Executive Compensation90Employment Agreements92Compensation of Directors93Long-Term Incentive Plan94SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT96CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS97Distributions and Payments to our General Partner and its Affiliates97Formation Stage97Operational Stage97Liquidation Stage98Ownership Interests in our General Partner98Election of Directors100Agreements Governing the Transactions100Omnibus Agreement100Relationships and Related Transactions with CFSI LLCand Cornerstone Family Services LLC101iiiTable of ContentsCONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES103Conflicts of Interest103Fiduciary Duties105DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMON UNITS108The Units108Transfer Agent and Registrar108Transfer of Common Units108Limited Voting Rights109DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBORDINATED UNITS110Subordination110Conversion of Subordinated Units110Distributions Upon Liquidation110Limited Voting Rights110THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT111Organization and Duration111Purpose111Power of Attorney111Capital Contributions111Limited Liability112Voting Rights113Issuance of Additional Securities114Amendment of the Partnership Agreement115Merger, Sale or Other Disposition of Assets118Termination and Dissolution118Liquidation and Distribution of Proceeds118Withdrawal or Removal of the General Partner119Transfer of General Partner Interest120Transfer of Incentive Distribution Rights120Transfer of Ownership Interests in the General Partner121Change of Management Provisions121Limited Call Right121Meetings; Voting121Status as Limited Partner or Assignee122Non-Citizen Assignees; Redemption123Indemnification123Reimbursement of Expenses123Books and Reports123Right to Inspect Our Books and Records124Registration Rights124UNITS ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE125MATERIAL TAX CONSEQUENCES127Partnership Status127Limited Partner Status129Tax Consequences of Unit Ownership129Tax Treatment of Operations134Disposition of Common Units135Uniformity of Units137Tax-Exempt Organizations and Other Investors138Administrative Matters138State, Local and Other Tax Considerations141ivTable of ContentsINVESTMENT IN STONEMOR PARTNERS L.P.
