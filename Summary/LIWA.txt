Consequently, fluctuations in copper prices can significantly affect our business and operating results.Our failure to address certain deficiencies and material weaknesses in our internal controls noted by our auditors, may result in improper accounting treatment, possible fraud by employees, litigation or penalties from the government.Our auditors, in planning and performing their audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008, have provided us with a letter describing certain matters involving our internal control and operation they consider to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
With the recent launch of this business, we expect that as the sales of the copper rod increases over time, there will be a decline in our gross margin, unless we are able to add additional processing capacity which we may not be able to do.Risks Associated With Doing Business In ChinaThere are substantial risks associated with doing business in China, as set forth in the following risk factors.Our operations and assets in China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties.Changes in PRC laws and regulations, or their interpretation, or the imposition of confiscatory taxation, restrictions on currency conversion, imports and sources of supply, devaluations of currency or the nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Any violation of these rules could result in fines and other penalties on our operations in China, restrictions or limitations on remitting dividends outside of China, and other forms of sanctions that may cause a material and adverse effect to our business, operations and financial conditions.The new mergers and acquisitions regulations also established additional procedures and requirements that are expected to make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise that owns well-known trademarks or China’s traditional brands.
Additionally, we may choose to expand our business through the capital expenditure plan we have in place to maintain existing machinery and to purchase additional manufacturing equipment for our new production facility.The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our development efforts, sales and marketing activities, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations.
