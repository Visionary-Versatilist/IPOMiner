We plan to accomplish this by:nAdvancing our existing compounds to regulatory approval;nLeveraging our management team’s established experience in the human biopharmaceutical and animal health industries;nUsing a direct sales organization and distributors to commercialize our products in the United States and Europe;nEngaging active partners to build a commercial presence; andnContinuing to expand our product pipeline by in-licensing additional compounds.Recent DevelopmentsConditional License for AT-005Effective as of January 22, 2014, we received a conditional license from the USDA for AT-005 as an aid for the treatment ofT-celllymphoma in dogs.
These risks include, among others:nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses since our inception.nAlthough we have two conditionally approved products, we are substantially dependent on the success of our current product candidates.nIf we are not successful in identifying, licensing, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, our ability to expand our business and achieve
our strategic objectives would be impaired.nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions of Vet Therapeutics and Okapi or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our existing or future product candidates under applicable regulatory requirements.nEven if our current or future product candidates obtain regulatory approval, they may never achieve market acceptance or commercial success.nDevelopment of pet therapeutics involves an expensive and lengthy process with uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future

In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:nthe results of our target animal studies for our current and future product candidates;nthe amount and timing of any milestone payments or royalties we must pay pursuant to our current or future license agreements or collaboration agreements;nthe timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our current or future product candidates;nthe upfront and other payments, and associated costs, related to identifying, acquiring and in-licensing new product candidates;nthe number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;nthe scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing any of our current or future product candidates and conducting target animal studies;nwhether we acquire any other companies, assets, intellectual property or technologies in the future;nour ability to partner with companies with an established commercial presence in Europe to provide our products in that market;nthe cost of commercialization activities, if any of our current or future product candidates are approved for sale, including marketing, sales and distribution

If we are not successful in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our business will be materially harmed and the value of your investment could substantially decline.The development of our biologic product candidates is dependent upon relatively novel technologies and uncertain regulatory pathways.As a result of our acquisition of Vet Therapeutics, we are developing biologics, including animal antibodies, for pets.
manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of pet therapeutics products are subject to extensive regulation by the CVM, the USDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, whose
