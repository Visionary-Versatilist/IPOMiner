To achieve this objective, we intend to:•expand our menu of clinical diagnostic products;•grow our installed base of customers;•increase utilization of tests with our customers;•develop and commercialize our NexGen system; and•expand internationally and explore out-licensing opportunities.Market Opportunity and Limitations of Current TechnologiesThe U.S. market
Some of our most significant risks are:•We have a history of net losses and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.•We may need to raise additional funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on a timely basis, or at all.•We are reliant on the commercial success of our XT-8 System and our FDA-cleared diagnostic tests.•We may fail to successfully expand the menu of diagnostic tests for our XT-8 System, obtain licenses to additional biomarkers on commercially

perform as expected or the reliability of the technology on which our products are based is questioned, our operating results and business will suffer.Our success depends on the market’s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality diagnostic systems and tests.
A product liability claim could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to successfully expand the menu of diagnostic tests for our XT-8 system or effectively predict the types of tests our existing and target customers want.We currently market three FDA-cleared diagnostic tests and have developed one other diagnostic test currently labeled for IUO.
These factors include:•the time and resources required to develop, conduct clinical studies and obtain regulatory clearances for the additional diagnostic tests we develop;•the expenses we incur for research and development required to maintain and improve our technology, including developing our next-generation molecular
results of such litigation.•the expenses we incur in connection with commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;•the expenses we incur in licensing biomarkers from third parties to expand the menu of diagnostics tests we plan to offer;10Table of Contents•our sales strategy and whether the revenues from sales of our test cartridges or XT-8 system will be sufficient to offset our expenses;•the costs to attract and retain personnel with the skills required for effective operations; and•the costs associated with being a public company.Our budgeted expense levels are based in part on our expectations concerning future revenues from sales of our XT-8 system and diagnostic tests.
customers;•the breadth of our menu of available diagnostic tests relative to our competitors;•our success in training reference and hospital-based laboratories in the proper use of our products;•the acceptance in the medical community of our molecular diagnostic technology and products;•the extent and success of our marketing and sales efforts; and•general economic conditions.Manufacturing risks and inefficiencies may adversely affect our ability to produce products; we have a sole source of supply for our XT-8 System.We must manufacture, or engage third parties to manufacture, components of our products in sufficient quantities and on a timely basis,
pace with emerging technologies, our systems and related tests will become uncompetitive and our market share will decline, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be unsuccessful in our long-term goal of expanding sales of our product offerings outside the United States.Assuming we receive the applicable regulatory approvals, we intend to market our diagnostic products outside the United States through
to new risks that, generally, we have not faced in the United States, including:•fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•unexpected changes in foreign regulatory requirements;•longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;•competition from companies located in the countries in which we offer our products, which may be a competitive disadvantage;•difficulties in managing and staffing international operations;•potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems, tax inefficiencies related to our corporate
structure and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;•the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and different legal standards;•increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;•political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general; and•reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.14Table of ContentsThe occurrence of any one of these risks could harm our business, results of operations and
will need to license other technology or patents to commercialize future products, including licenses to additional biomarkers to expand our menu of diagnostic tests.
cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate are the risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and other factors, including:•fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of our competitors;•changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;•variance in our financial performance from the expectations of securities analysts;•changes in the estimates of the future size and growth rate of our markets;•changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;•failure of our products to achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success;•conditions and trends in the markets we serve;•changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;•success of competitive products and services;•changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors;•changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;•announcements of significant new products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;•the timing and outcome of regulatory reviews and approvals of our products;•changes in legislation or regulatory policies, practices or actions;25Table of Contents•the commencement or outcome of litigation involving our company, our general industry or both;•recruitment or departure of key personnel;•changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;•actual or expected sales of our common stock by the holders of our common stock; and•the trading volume of our common stock.In addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Global Market and the market for diagnostics companies in particular may experience a loss of investor confidence.
Factors that may cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the risks described under “Risk Factors,” including:•failure to obtain sufficient funding for the continued development and commercialization of our products;•failure to expand our menu of diagnostic tests, including the failure to obtain licenses to additional biomarkers on commercially reasonable terms;•increases in our projected expenditures on sales and marketing, research and development and administrative activities;•less than anticipated growth in the market for diagnostic testing generally and for the tests we are developing or may develop in the future;•failure of our products to gain market acceptance domestically or internationally;•inability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for any of our products;•changes in the regulatory environment which may adversely impact the commercialization of our new products and result in significant additional capital
in litigation and significant expenditures;•refusal of third-party payors to reimburse our customers for use of diagnostic systems and tests; and•failure to develop our NexGen System with the capabilities we intend to offer.Potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are
offering price of $5.44 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, or approximately $26.4 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full.We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the following purposes:•$10.3 million for research and development, including license or technology acquisitions, menu expansion and development of our NexGen System;•$6.2 million to fund our planned sales and marketing initiatives; and•the balance to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes.We have no commitments with respect to any future acquisitions or licenses.The foregoing expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
