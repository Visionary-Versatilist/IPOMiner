For example:Ÿwe do not expect to achieve profitability in the near term, especially as we expand our direct sales force, conduct our clinical studies and acquire and develop new product offerings,

At present, we do not manufacture our products outside the United States nor do we engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.We rely on our independent distributors to market and sell our products in select markets outside of the United States and Canada.Sales of our products through independent distributors represented 16% of our net sales for the twelve month period ended September 30, 2006.

From 1998 to 2005, we raised $16.4 million of equity capital in a series of financing rounds.Our business opportunities include the following:Ÿthe continued expansion of our sales force in the United States, the European Union and Japan;Ÿthe addition of complementary products through further acquisitions; andŸthe introduction of our products in new markets upon achievement of regulatory approvals in these markets.We are currently pursuing each of these opportunities and believe that the proceeds from this offering will better enable us to do so.These opportunities are balanced by several challenges, such as the penetration of our product offerings in current and new markets, the recruitment and retention of key employees and competition from other products and techniques.
