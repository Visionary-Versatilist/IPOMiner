Further, any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows from future prospects.20TABLE OF CONTENTSWe are dependent on a key ingredient for ContraPest, triptolide, which has limited sources and must be in a very refined condition.If we are unable to develop additional sources of triptolide, which is one of the key ingredients for ContraPest, the long term ability to produce ContraPest at a cost effective price could be in jeopardy; the limited sources could restrict our production if supplies were reduced; another use of the ingredient could cause the price to increase beyond our ability to market at a competitive price; and increased demand for the ingredient could cause the quality of the refined ingredient to be less than needed for our production.A variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business.We plan to seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the U.S. and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:•Differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries;•Unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;•Economic weakness, including inflation or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;•Compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;•Foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;•Foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;•Difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;•Workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;•Potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, or comparable foreign regulations;•Challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;•Production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and•Business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.These and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws with respect to our operations and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal and/or civil liability and harm our business.We are subject to the FCPA, which is the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C.
