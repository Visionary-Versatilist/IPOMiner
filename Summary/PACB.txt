Global Market under the symbol “PACB”.Per shareTotalInitial public offering price$$Underwriting discounts and commissions$$Proceeds to Pacific Biosciences, before expenses$$We have granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 1,875,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments.Investing in our common stock involves risks.
The growth in this market is expected to be driven by increases in the demand for sequencing products from both research institutions and commercial companies, including genome centers, government and academic institutions, genomic service
to receive an upgrade to a commercial release version of the PacBioRS,at which time each customer will be obligated to pay the balance of their order and we will then recognize revenue.As of June 30, 2010, our backlog was approximately $15 million, which includes both orders for limited production
Our research and development efforts are focused on product enhancements to reduce DNA sequencing cost and time as well as expand capabilities.•Leverage platform to develop and launch additional applications.We plan to leverage our SMRT technology platform to
variation;•we may never earn revenue from our orders in backlog;•we have limited experience in selling and marketing our products and, as a result, may be unable to successfully commercialize our SMRT technology;•rapidly changing technology in life sciences could make the products we are developing obsolete and we may not be able to develop and manufacture
