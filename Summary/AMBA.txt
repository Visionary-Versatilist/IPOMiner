During fiscal year 2012 and for the six months ended July 31,11Table of Contents2012, our largest ODM customer accounted for approximately 15% and 16% of our revenue, respectively, primarily serving one large OEM end customer.We believe that our operating results for the foreseeable
reduction in sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new customers could seriously impact our revenue and harm our results of operations.Achieving design wins is subject to lengthy competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant costs.
currently expect, demand for our video and image processing SoCs may not materialize as expected and our business and operating results could suffer.If we fail to develop and introduce new or enhanced solutions on a timely basis, our ability to attract and retain customers could
will achieve revenue from the sales of our solutions into the DSC camera market.If we fail to penetrate these or other new markets we are targeting, our revenue likely will decrease over time and our financial condition could suffer.The average selling prices of video and image
processing solutions in our target markets have historically decreased over time and will likely do so in the future, which could harm our revenue and gross margins.Average selling prices of semiconductor products in the
Our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to anticipate market and technology trends and successfully develop solutions that meet market needs;•our success in identifying and penetrating new markets, applications and customers;•our ability to understand the price points and performance metrics of competing products in the marketplace;•our solutions’ performance and cost-effectiveness relative to that of competing products;•our ability to gain access to leading design tools and product specifications at the same time as our competitors;•our ability to develop and maintain relationships with key OEMs and ODMs;•our products’ effective implementation of video processing standards;•our ability to protect our intellectual property;•our ability to expand international operations in a timely and cost-efficient manner;•our ability to deliver products in volume on a timely basis at competitive prices; and•our ability to recruit design and application engineers with expertise in image video and image processing technologies and sales and marketing
of analysts and investors, which could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.17Table of ContentsFactors that may affect our operating results include:•shifts in consumer preferences and any resultant change in demand for video and image capture devices into which our solutions are incorporated;•changes in the competitive dynamics of our markets, including new entrants or pricing pressures;•variances in order patterns by our customers, particularly any of our significant customers;•our ability to successfully define, design and release new solutions in a timely manner that meet our customers’
share, a decrease in revenue or negatively impact our operating results.Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to compete effectively or defend ourselves from litigation, which could harm our business, financial
