In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including:•the results of our clinical trials for RT001 and RT002;•the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for RT001, RT002 or any future product candidates;•the number and characteristics of any additional product candidates we develop or acquire;•the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing RT001, RT002 or any future product candidates, and conducting preclinical and
acceptance or commercial success would materially adversely affect our results of operations and delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain.

these third parties or consultants do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize RT001, RT002 or any future product candidates.We do not have the ability to independently conduct preclinical studies or clinical trials.
