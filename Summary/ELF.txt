combining our strong relationships with leading retailers with integrated consumer engagement across our e.l.f. stores,e-commerceand social media, we are a true multi-channel brand.Our net sales growth in the United States from 2012 to 2015 was 20 times that of the mass cosmetics category on average.
Below is a summary of some of the principal risks we face:•The cosmetics industry is highly competitive, and if we are unable to compete effectively our results will suffer.•Our new product introductions may not be as successful as we anticipate.•We depend on a limited number of retailers for a large portion of our net sales, and the loss of one or more of these retailers, or business challenges at one or more of these retailers, could adversely affect our
results of operations.•Our success depends, in part, on the quality, performance and safety of our products.•We may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy.•Our growth and profitability are dependent on trends that may change or not continue, and our historical growth may not be indicative of our future growth.•We may be unable to manage our growth effectively, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.•Any damage to our reputation or brand may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.•A disruption in our operations could materially and adversely affect our business.•We are dependent on third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and other vendors.•We may not be able to adequately protect intellectual property and other proprietary rights in our products and may be subject to claims that we infringe or misappropriate the rights of others.5Table of Contents•We have significant operations in China, which exposes us to risks inherent in doing business there.•We are not required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”) for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company.”Our sponsorTPG Growth II Management, LLC (“TPG Growth” or our

If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our new product introductions may not be as successful as we anticipate.The cosmetics industry is driven in part by fashion and beauty trends, which may shift quickly.
Any of these occurrences could delay or impede our ability to achieve our sales objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.As part of our ongoing business strategy we expect we will need to continue to introduce new products in our traditional product categories of eyes, lips, face and
breaches, regulatory investigations or employee misconduct;•any credit risks associated with the financial condition of our retail customers;•the effect of consolidation or weakness in the retail industry or at certain retail customers, including store closures and the resulting uncertainty; and•inventory reduction initiatives and other factors affecting retail customer buying patterns, including any reduction in retail space committed to cosmetics and retailer practices used to control inventory shrinkage.12Table of ContentsOur success depends, in part, on the quality, performance and safety of our products.Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products, whether related to product contamination or product safety or quality failures,
unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors:•we may lose one or more significant retail customers, or sales of our products through these retail customers may decrease;•the ability of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our products and of our distributors to distribute our products could be disrupted;•because all of our products are sourced and manufactured in China, our operations are susceptible to risks inherent in doing business there;•our products may be the subject of regulatory actions, including but not limited to actions by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and the Consumer
damage to, the manufacturing facilities or distribution centers of our third-party manufacturers, suppliers and delivery service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend heavily on ocean container delivery to receive shipments of our products from our third-party manufacturers located in China and contracted third-party delivery
Our indebtedness could have significant consequences, including:•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of funding growth, working capital, capital expenditures, investments or other cash requirements;•reducing our flexibility to adjust to changing business conditions or obtain additional financing;•exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as our borrowings are at variable rates;•making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;•subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business, including our ability to take certain actions with respect to indebtedness, liens, sales of assets, consolidations and
mergers, affiliate transactions, dividends and other distributions and changes of control;•subjecting us to maintenance covenants which require us to maintain specific financial ratios; and•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes.Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality, order patterns from key retail customers and other factors, and we may not have sufficient
increase in tariffs or other trade barriers, could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, increase our costs and reduce the competitiveness of our products in the U.S. market.If our cash from operations is not sufficient to meet our current or future operating needs, expenditures and debt service obligations, our business, financial
will subject us to risks associated with long-termnon-cancelableleases and increased capital requirements that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our growth strategy is dependent in part on our ability to open and operate newbrick-and-mortare.l.f. stores in high-traffic areas in the United States.
International sales and increased international operations may be subject to risks such as:•difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;•burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including more stringent regulations relating to data privacy and security, particularly in the European Union;•adverse tax effects and foreign exchange controls making it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;22Table of Contents•political and economic instability;•terrorist activities and natural disasters;•trade restrictions;•differing employment practices and laws and labor disruptions;•the imposition of government controls;•an inability to use or to obtain adequate intellectual property protection for our key brands and products;•tariffs and customs duties and the classifications of our goods by applicable governmental bodies;•a legal system subject to undue influence or corruption;•a business culture in which illegal sales practices may be prevalent;•logistics and sourcing;•military conflicts; and•acts of terrorism.The occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and
Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.24Table of ContentsGovernment regulations and private party actions relating to the marketing and advertising of our products and
