sufficient breadth and depth of the titles necessary to satisfy increased demand arising from growth in our subscriber base, our subscriber satisfaction may be affected adversely.The increased utilization of our regional distribution centers is intended to decrease the delivery and return times for DVDs. We anticipate that subscribers will exchange
more titles as a result of the reduced time that DVDs spend in transit, and that our shipping and delivery costs and revenue sharing expenses will increase, which would adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increased subscriber
The following factors may affect us from period-to-period and may affect our long-term performance:žour ability to manage our fulfillment processes to handle significant increases in the number of subscribers and subscriber selections;6žour ability to improve or maintain gross margins in our business;žchanges by our competitors to their product and service offerings;žprice competition;žour ability to maintain an adequate breadth and depth of titles;žour ability to manage our inventory levels;žchanges in promotional support offered by studios;žour ability to maintain, upgrade and develop our Web site, our internal computer systems and our fulfillment processes and utilize efficiently our distribution centers;žfluctuations in consumer spending on DVD players, DVDs and related products;žfluctuations in the use of the Internet for the purchase of consumer goods and services such as those offered by us;žtechnical difficulties, system downtime or Internet disruptions;žour ability to attract new and qualified personnel in a timely and effective manner and retain existing personnel;žthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;žour ability to effectively manage the development of new business segments and markets;žour ability to maintain and develop new and existing marketing relationships;žour ability to successfully manage the integration of operations and technology resulting from acquisitions;žgovernmental regulation and taxation policies; andžgeneral economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the Internet, online commerce and the movie industry.In addition to these factors, our operating results may fluctuate based upon seasonal fluctuations in DVD player sales and in the use of the Internet.
Therefore, if the cost of delivering titles were to increase, our marketing expense would be adversely affected.If we are unable to effectively utilize our CineMatch technology, our business may suffer.Based on proprietary algorithms, our CineMatch technology enables us to predict and recommend titles and effectively merchandize our library to our subscribers.
that we will continue to be successful in enticing subscribers to rate enough titles for our database to effectively predict and recommend new or existing titles.If CineMatch does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our subscribers will enjoy, our personal movie recommendation service will be less useful, in which event:žour subscriber satisfaction may decrease, subscribers may perceive our service to be of lower value and our ability to attract and retain subscribers may be affected adversely;žour ability to effectively merchandise and utilize our library will be affected adversely; andžour subscribers may default to choosing titles from among new releases or other titles that cost us more to provide, and our margins may be affected adversely.8If we do not correctly anticipate our short and long-term needs for titles that we acquire pursuant to revenue
Conversely, if we attempt to mitigate this risk and acquire more copies than needed to satisfy our subscriber demand, then our inventory utilization would become less effective and our gross margins would be affected adversely.If our subscribers select titles that are more expensive for us to acquire and deliver on a more frequent basis, our expenses would increase.Certain titles cost us more to acquire or result in greater revenue sharing expenses depending on the source from whom they
industry, including constraints on capital, financial difficulties, regulatory requirements and strikes, work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers,10actors or other essential personnel, could affect adversely the availability of new titles, consumer demand for filmed entertainment and our business.If we are unable to renegotiate our revenue sharing agreements when they expire on terms favorable to us, or if the cost to us of purchasing titles on a wholesale basis
If disposable DVDs become a viable alternative method of content delivery supported by the studios, our business could be adversely affected.If we fail to maintain or adequately replace our outside sources of new subscribers or are unable to continue to market our service in the manner currently conducted, our
operations, the perception of our business and service to subscribers and potential subscribers may become confused in the marketplace and our ability to attract subscribers may be adversely affected.Intellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our Web site, CineMatch technology, title
our subscriber acquisition and retention and operating results may be affected adversely.Risks Related to this OfferingOur officers and directors and their affiliates will exercise significant control over Netflix.After the completion of this offering, our executive officers and directors, their immediate family members and affiliated venture capital funds will beneficially own, in the aggregate,
