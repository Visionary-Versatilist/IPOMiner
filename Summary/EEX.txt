Some of these limitations include:•Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;•Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are not adjusted for all noncash income or expense items that are reflected in our financial statements;•Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect the noncash component of employee compensation;•Adjusted EBITDA and Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;•Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income do not reflect certain one-off cash requirements or one-time cash adjustments resulting from matters we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance;•Adjusted EBITDA and Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; and•other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA, Acquisition Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Free Cash Flow only as supplemental information.ivTABLE OF CONTENTSSUMMARYThis summary highlights information contained in this prospectus and does not contain all of the information that youshould consider in making your investment decision.
During the fourth quarter of 2017 we received an insurance settlement of $6.5 million (recorded as Other Income) to offset substantially all of the lost revenues from the affected shows.1TABLE OF CONTENTSWe have a highly attractive business model with:•strong revenue growth, achieving a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 8% from 2014 through 2017;•attractive organic revenue growth, achieving a CAGR of approximately 3% from 2014 through 2017;•a demonstrated ability to regularly source and integrate accretive acquisitions;•significant revenue visibility, with approximately 87% and 99% of our eventual 2017 revenue from booth space sales (which represents 72% of our total 2017 revenue) sold by the end of the first and second quarters of 2017, respectively;•a demonstrated capacity to achieve regular annual price increases across our portfolio;•diversification by industry sector and customer, with no single customer accounting for even 1% of total revenue; and•a highly fragmented industry structure, which presents significant opportunities to grow through accretive acquisitions, but also limited direct competition at the individual show level.In addition, we convert a high proportion of our revenue into cash due to:•our efficient cost structure, as evidenced by our Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by our revenue for the applicable period) in excess of 45% for each of the last four completed fiscal years;•our asset-light business model, which requires minimal capital expenditures ($3.0 million in 2017, of which less than one quarter related to maintenance capital expenditures);•our ability to collect cash deposits from our customers in advance of our shows, resulting in attractive working capital dynamics; and•our expected low effective tax rate (relative to Adjusted EBITDA), which is primarily attributable to our favorable tax attributes.
Some of the more significant risks are:•At any given point in time, general economic conditions may have an adverse impact on the industry sectors in which our trade shows and conferences operate, and therefore may negatively affect demand for exhibition space and attendance at our trade shows and conferences;•The success of each of our trade shows depends on the reputation of that show’s brand;•We may not be able to secure or retain desirable dates and locations for our trade shows;•Attendance at our shows could decline as a result of disruptions in global or local travel conditions, such as congestion at airports, the risk of or an actual terrorist action, adverse weather or fear of communicable diseases;•We may fail to accurately monitor or respond to changing market trends and adapt our trade show portfolio accordingly;•If we fail to attract leading brands as exhibitors in, or high-quality attendees to, our trade shows, we may lose the benefit of the self-reinforcing “network effect” we enjoy today;•We may face increased competition from existing trade show operators or new competitors;•A significant portion of our revenue is generated by our top five trade shows;•We intend to continue to be highly acquisitive, and our acquisition growth strategy entails risk;•Our exhibitors may choose to use an increasing portion of their marketing and advertising budgets to fund online initiatives or otherwise reduce the amount of money they have available to spend in connection with our trade shows;•We may lose the services of members of our senior management team or of certain of our key full time employees and we may not be able to replace them adequately;•We use third-party agents whom we do not control to sell space at our trade shows, particularly to international exhibitors;•Changes in legislation, regulation and government policy may have a material adverse effect on our business in the future;•Recently enacted changes to the U.S. tax laws may have a material impact on us;•A loss or disruption of the services from one or more of the limited number of outside contractors who specialize in decoration, facility set-up and other services in connection with our trade shows could harm our business;•The industry associations that sponsor and market our trade shows could cease to do so effectively, or could be replaced or supplemented by new industry associations who do not sponsor or market our trade shows;•Our launch of new trade shows or new initiatives with respect to current trade shows may be unsuccessful and consume significant management and financial resources;•We do not own certain of the trade shows that we operate or certain trademarks associated with some of our shows;•The infringement or invalidation of proprietary rights could have an adverse effect on our business;•Our information technology systems, including our ERP business management system, could be disrupted;•We could fail to protect certain employee or customer data;•We face risks associated with event cancellations or other interruptions to our business, which the insurance we maintain may not fully cover;•We may face material litigation;•We may be unable to fully utilize the benefits associated with our favorable tax attributes; and•We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.

These acquired intangible assets are amortized over an extended period ranging from seven to ten years from the date of each acquisition.(i)Represents the impact of revaluing our net deferred tax liabilities from the previously applicable corporate tax rate of 35% to the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate of 21% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017.(j)Reflects application of U.S. federal and state enterprise tax rates of 36.5%, 39.1% and 39.3% in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.20TABLE OF CONTENTS(11)In addition to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP, we present Free Cash Flow because we believe it is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated from our core operations that, after capital expenditures, can be used for the repayment of indebtedness and strategic initiatives, including investing in our business, paying dividends, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.Free Cash Flow is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of liquidity and is not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP.
Notwithstanding the fact that ASD Market Week and NY NOW represent multiple product categories and that all of our shows are highly diversified by customer, a significant decline in the performance or prospects of any one of these significant trade shows could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We intend to continue to be highly acquisitive, and our acquisition growth strategy entails risk.Our acquisition growth strategy entails various risks, including, among others:•the risks inherent in identifying desirable acquisition candidates, including management time spent away from running our core business and external costs associated with identifying such acquisition candidates;•the risk that we turn out to be wrong with respect to selecting and consummating what we had believed to be accretive acquisitions;24TABLE OF CONTENTS•the risk of overpaying for a particular acquisition;•the risks of successfully integrating an acquisition and retaining the key employees and/or customers of acquired businesses;•the risks relating to potential unknown liabilities of acquired businesses;•the cultural, execution, currency, tax and other risks associated with any future international expansion; and•the risks associated with financing an acquisition, which may involve diluting our existing stockholders, reducing our liquidity or incurring additional debt, which in turn could result in increased debt service costs and/or a requirement to comply with certain financial or other covenants.In furtherance of our strategy of growth through acquisitions, we routinely review and conduct investigations of potential acquisitions, some of which may be material.
