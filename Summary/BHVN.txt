Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of our ongoing and planned preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;•the timing and amount of milestone and royalty payments we are required to make under our license agreements;•the extent to which we in-license or acquire other product candidates and technologies;•the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue, and other indications for our current product

The success of our product candidates will depend on several additional factors, including:•completing clinical trials that demonstrate their efficacy and safety;•receiving marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;•completing any post-marketing studies required by applicable regulatory authorities;•establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities;•launching commercial sales, marketing and distribution operations;•the prevalence and severity of adverse events experienced with our product candidates;•acceptance of our product candidates by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;•a continued acceptable safety profile following approval;•obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates;•competing effectively with other therapies, including with respect to the sales and marketing of our product candidates, if approved; and•qualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending our intellectual property rights and claims.Many
