In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Risks Inherent in Our BusinessOur business and financial performance depends on the oil and natural gas industry and particularly on the level of capital spending and exploration and production activity within the United States and in the Permian Basin, and a decline in prices for oil and natural gas may have an adverse effect on our revenue, cash flows, profitability and growth.Demand for most of our services depends substantially on the level of capital expenditures in the Permian Basin by companies in the oil and natural gas industry.
In addition, a worsening of these conditions may result in a material adverse impact on certain of our customers’ liquidity and financial position resulting in further spending reductions, delays in the collection of amounts owing to us and similar impacts.Many factors over which we have no control affect the supply of and demand for, and our customers’ willingness to explore, develop and produce oil and natural gas, and therefore, influence prices for our services, including:•the domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas;•the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas;•the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;•the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;•the supply of and demand for drilling and hydraulic fracturing equipment;•the expected decline rates of current production;•the price and quantity of foreign imports;•political and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries and regions, including the United States, the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;•actions by the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with respect to oil production levels and announcements of potential changes in such levels;•speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;•the level of consumer product demand;11•the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;•contractions in the credit market;•the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar;•available pipeline and other transportation capacity;•the levels of oil and natural gas storage;•weather conditions and other natural disasters;•domestic and foreign tax policy;•domestic and foreign governmental approvals and regulatory requirements and conditions;•the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including military action in the Middle East;•technical advances affecting energy consumption;•the proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;•the price and availability of alternative fuels;•the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing;•merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers; and•overall domestic and global economic conditions.These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty.
In addition, future price increases for this type of equipment, parts and raw materials could negatively impact our ability to purchase new equipment, to update or expand our existing fleet, to timely repair equipment in our existing fleet or meet the current demands of our customers.Reliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.The majority of our revenue is generated from our hydraulic fracturing services.
The Department of Transportation periodically conducts compliance reviews and may revoke registration privileges based on certain safety performance criteria that could result in a suspension of operations.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and future compliance, claims, and liabilities relating to such matters may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.The nature of our operations, including the handling, transporting and disposing of a variety of fluids and substances, including hydraulic fracturing fluids and other regulated substances, air emissions, and wastewater discharges exposes us to some risks of environmental liability, including the release of pollutants from oil and natural gas wells and associated equipment to the environment.
Any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are discovered or developed, whether due to the passage of legislation, increased governmental regulation leading to limitations, or prohibitions on exploration and drilling activity, including hydraulic fracturing, or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment.We may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We operate with most of our customers under master service agreements, or MSAs. We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in the MSAs. Generally, under our MSAs, including those relating to our hydraulic fracturing services, we assume responsibility for, including control and removal of, pollution or contamination which originates above surface and originates from our equipment or services.
