anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:•continue to develop and conduct clinical trials with respect to our product candidates CAT-1004 and CAT-2054, including a planned
Phase 1/2 clinical trial of CAT-1004 for which we plan to initiate patient enrollment in June 2015 and an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of CAT-2054 that we initiated in January 2015;•initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for our other product candidates;•seek to identify and develop additional product candidates;•seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any;•establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure in the future to commercialize various products for which
we may obtain marketing approval, if any;•require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and potentially commercialization;•maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;•hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control and scientific personnel;•add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development

In addition, many of the factors that lead to clinical trial delays may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of any of our product candidates.If we, or any future collaborators, experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients
of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:•the efficacy and safety of the product;•the potential advantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;23Table of Contents•the prevalence and severity of any side effects;•the clinical indications for which the product is approved;•whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy;•limitations or warnings, including distribution or use restrictions, contained in the product's approved labeling;•our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to offer the product for sale at competitive prices;•the product's convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;•the willingness of the target patient population to try, and of physicians to prescribe, the product;•the strength of sales, marketing and distribution support;•the approval of other new products for the same indications;•changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for the product;•the timing of market introduction of our approved products as well as competitive products;•availability and amount of reimbursement from government payors, managed care plans and other third-party payors;•adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and•potential product liability claims.The
