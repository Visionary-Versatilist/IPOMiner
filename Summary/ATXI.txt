We are dependent on the success of IV Tramadol and cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the required studies or that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.Our business success depends ultimately on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize our only product candidate, IV Tramadol, and any significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing IV Tramadol will have a substantial adverse impact on our business and financial condition.If approved, our ability to generate revenues from IV Tramadol will depend on our ability to:•hire, train, deploy and support our sales force;•create market demand for IV Tramadol through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote this product candidate we may later establish;•obtain sufficient quantities of IV Tramadol from our third party manufacturers as required to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter;•establish and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;•obtain and maintain government and private payer reimbursement for our product; and•maintain patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for IV Tramadol.We may not receive regulatory approval for IV Tramadol or future product candidates, or its or their approvals may be delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.IV Tramadol and other future product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.
Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims.For example, some of the adverse events observed in the IV Tramadol clinical trials completed to date include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, sweating, vomiting, dry mouth, somnolence and hypotension.Additionally, if one or more of our current or future product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by this product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may require the addition of serious risk-related labeling statements, specific warnings, precautions, or contraindication;•regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, or require it to be removed from the market;•regulatory authorities may require implementation of burdensome post-market risk mitigation strategies and practices;•we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; or•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining marketing approval and market acceptance of our product candidate or future product candidates or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.Even if IV Tramadol receives regulatory approval, it and any other products we may market will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny.IV Tramadol and any other product candidates we may license or acquire will also be subject to ongoing requirements and review of the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:•restrictions on such products, operations, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;•restrictions on product distribution or use;•requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;•warning letters;•withdrawal of the products from the market;•refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;•recall of products;•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits;•suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;•suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;•product seizure; or•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates.
The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not necessarily limited to:•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;•federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower orqui tamactions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent, making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or the knowing retention of an overpayment from government health care programs; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;•the federal Open Payments program, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to “payments or other transfers of value” made to physicians, which is defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, and certain teaching hospitals and applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members.
In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or corrective advertising, institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or civil or criminal prosecution by the government, any of which could harm our reputation and business.Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of, and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidate are the following:•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products;•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;•new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program;•new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;•a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.President Trump ran for office on a platform that supported the repeal of the ACA and one of his first actions after his inauguration was to sign an Executive Order commanding federal agencies to try to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others.
The degree of market acceptance of IV Tramadol or any other product candidate we may license or acquire will depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:•the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;•the timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;•the clinical indications for which the drug is approved;•acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;•the safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;•the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;•the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third party payors and government authorities;•the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product candidate for clinical practices;•the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;•the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for a companion diagnostic, if any;•the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;•limitations or warnings contained in the product’s FDA-approved labeling;•changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any superiority claims that we could make following FDA approval; and•potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments.If any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is not perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance.
We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any replacement manufacturers.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, restricts the importation of a controlled substance finished drug product when the same substance is commercially available in the United States, which could reduce the number of potential alternative manufacturers for IV Tramadol.21TABLE OF CONTENTSOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials.
We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if:•IV Tramadol or other product candidates are approved for commercial sale, due to the necessity in establishing adequate commercial infrastructure to launch this product candidate without substantial delays, including hiring sales and marketing personnel and contracting with third parties for warehousing, distribution, cash collection and related commercial activities;•we are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies in addition to those currently expected;•there are any delays in completing our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates;29TABLE OF CONTENTS•we execute other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements;•there variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs;•there are any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuits in which we may become involved; and•there are any regulatory developments affecting IV Tramadol or the product candidates of our competitors.Our ability to become profitable depends upon our ability to generate revenue.
Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:•the timing, design and conduct of, and results from, preclinical and clinical trials for our product candidates;•the potential for delays in our efforts to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates, and any costs associated with such delays;•the costs of establishing a commercial organization to sell, market and distribute our product candidates;•the rate of progress and costs of our efforts to prepare for the submission of an NDA for any product candidates that we may in-license or acquire in the future, and the potential that we may need to conduct additional clinical trials to support applications for regulatory approval;•the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our product candidates, including any such costs we may be required to expend if our licensors are unwilling or unable to do so;•the cost and timing of securing sufficient supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturers for clinical trials and in preparation for commercialization;•the effect of competing technological and market developments;•the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish;•if one or more of our product candidates are approved, the potential that we may be required to file a lawsuit to defend our patent rights or regulatory exclusivities from challenges by companies seeking to market generic versions of one or more of our product candidates; and•the success of the commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies.In order to carry out our business plan and implement our strategy, we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional financing from time to time and may choose to raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements, public or private equity or debt financing, bank lines of credit, asset sales, government grants, or other arrangements.
current financial or other information concerning us, as is required by Rule 144 as part of the conditions of its availability.Our stock may be subject to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and may prevent our stockholders from reselling our common stock at a profit.The market prices for securities of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have historically been highly volatile, and the market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies.The market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:•announcements concerning the progress of our efforts to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize IV Tramadol or future product candidates, including any requests we receive from the FDA for additional studies or data that result in delays in obtaining regulatory approval or launching this product candidate, if approved;•market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors or the economy as a whole;•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;•the failure of IV Tramadol or future product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;•announcements of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;•developments concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;•litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products;•actual fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, and concerns by investors that such fluctuations may occur in the future;•deviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments;•additions or departures of key personnel;•health care reform legislation, including measures directed at controlling the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and third party coverage and reimbursement policies;•developments concerning current or future strategic collaborations; and•discussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities.Following completion of our proposed initial public offering, Fortress will continue to control a voting majority of our common stock, whose interests may differ from yours.Pursuant to the terms of the Class A Preferred Stock held by Fortress, Fortress will be entitled to cast, for each share of Class A Preferred Stock held by Fortress, the number of votes that is equal to 1.1 times a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of outstanding common stock and (B) the whole shares of common stock into which the shares of outstanding the Class A Preferred Stock are convertible and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of shares of outstanding Class A Preferred Stock, or the Class A Preferred Stock Ratio.
our net tangible book value after this offering by approximately $5.6 million, or $0.76 per share, and decrease the dilution per share to new investors by approximately $0.46 per share, assuming that the assumed public offering price remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on 3,341,468 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017, after giving effect to our proposed 3 for 1 reverse stock split, representing 3,257,937 shares of our common stock outstanding and 83,531 shares of our common stock issued to Fortress pursuant to the PIK Dividend, and excludes the following:•1,000,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2015 Incentive Plan (there have been no options granted or other securities issued under our 2015 Incentive Plan);•50,000 shares of our common stock convertible upon the completion of our initial public offering related to the sale of convertible notes in December 2016 in the aggregate amount of $200,000; and•125,000 shares underlying a warrant that was issued to National Securities Corporation in October 2015, which number of shares is calculated in accordance with the formula specified therein, by dividing $750,000 with the assumed public offering price of $6.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus.40TABLE OF CONTENTSDILUTIONIf you invest in our common stock in this offering, your ownership interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the offering price per share of our common stock and the as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after the offering.
Similarly, a decrease of one million shares in the number of shares offered by us in the assumed initial public offering would decrease our net tangible book value after this offering by approximately $5.6 million, or $0.76 per share, and decrease the dilution per share to new investors by approximately $0.46 per share, assuming that the assumed public offering price remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.41TABLE OF CONTENTSThe number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on 3,341,468 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017, after giving effect to our proposed 3 for 1 reverse stock split, representing 3,257,937 shares of our common stock outstanding and 83,531 shares of our common stock issued to Fortress pursuant to the PIK Dividend, and excludes the following:•1,000,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2015 Incentive Plan (there have been no options granted or other securities issued under our 2015 Incentive Plan);•50,000 shares of our common stock convertible upon the completion of our initial public offering related to the sale of convertible notes in December 2016 in the aggregate amount of $200,000; and•125,000 shares underlying a warrant that was issued to National Securities Corporation in October 2015, which number of shares is calculated in accordance with the formula specified therein, by dividing $750,000 with the assumed public offering price of $6.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus.42TABLE OF CONTENTSMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISOF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONForward-Looking StatementsStatements in the following discussion and throughout this registration statement that are not historical in nature are “forward-looking statements.” You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “intend,” “believe,” and similar expressions.
In 2016, this annual equity fee was replaced with the Class A Preferred Stock dividend.We expect our research and development activities to increase as we develop our existing product candidate and potentially acquire new product candidates, reflecting increasing costs associated with the following:•employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits, and rent expenses;•license fees and milestone payments related to in-licensed products and technology;•expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities;•the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; and•costs associated with non-clinical activities, and regulatory approvals.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of professional fees for legal and consulting services, personnel-related costs, and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development expenses.For the year ended December 31, 2016, and for the period from February 9, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2015, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
