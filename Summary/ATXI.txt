our net tangible book value after this offering by approximately $5.6 million, or $0.76 per share, and decrease the dilution per share to new investors by approximately $0.46 per share, assuming that the assumed public offering price remains the same, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on 3,341,468 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017, after giving effect to our proposed 3 for 1 reverse stock split, representing 3,257,937 shares of our common stock outstanding and 83,531 shares of our common stock issued to Fortress pursuant to the PIK Dividend, and excludes the following:•1,000,000 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2015 Incentive Plan (there have been no options granted or other securities issued under our 2015 Incentive Plan);•50,000 shares of our common stock convertible upon the completion of our initial public offering related to the sale of convertible notes in December 2016 in the aggregate amount of $200,000; and•125,000 shares underlying a warrant that was issued to National Securities Corporation in October 2015, which number of shares is calculated in accordance with the formula specified therein, by dividing $750,000 with the assumed public offering price of $6.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the price range listed on the cover page of this prospectus.8TABLE OF CONTENTSRISK FACTORSThe following information sets forth risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements we have made in this prospectus and those we may make from time to time.
We are dependent on the success of IV Tramadol and cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete the required studies or that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.Our business success depends ultimately on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize our only product candidate, IV Tramadol, and any significant delays in obtaining approval for and commercializing IV Tramadol will have a substantial adverse impact on our business and financial condition.If approved, our ability to generate revenues from IV Tramadol will depend on our ability to:•hire, train, deploy and support our sales force;•create market demand for IV Tramadol through our own marketing and sales activities, and any other arrangements to promote this product candidate we may later establish;•obtain sufficient quantities of IV Tramadol from our third party manufacturers as required to meet commercial demand at launch and thereafter;•establish and maintain agreements with wholesalers, distributors and group purchasing organizations on commercially reasonable terms;•obtain and maintain government and private payer reimbursement for our product; and•maintain patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for IV Tramadol.We may not receive regulatory approval for IV Tramadol or future product candidates, or its or their approvals may be delayed, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.IV Tramadol and other future product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States.
Drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial and could result in potential product liability claims.For example, some of the adverse events observed in the IV Tramadol clinical trials completed to date include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, sweating, vomiting, dry mouth, somnolence and hypotension.Additionally, if one or more of our current or future product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by this product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:•regulatory authorities may require the addition of serious risk-related labeling statements, specific warnings, precautions, or contraindication;•regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, or require it to be removed from the market;•regulatory authorities may require implementation of burdensome post-market risk mitigation strategies and practices;•we may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; or•our reputation may suffer.Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining marketing approval and market acceptance of our product candidate or future product candidates or could substantially increase our commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale.Even if IV Tramadol receives regulatory approval, it and any other products we may market will remain subject to substantial regulatory scrutiny.IV Tramadol and any other product candidates we may license or acquire will also be subject to ongoing requirements and review of the FDA and other regulatory authorities.
Violations of the FDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to investigations alleging violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws.In addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may yield various results, including:•restrictions on such products, operations, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;•restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product;•restrictions on product distribution or use;•requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;•warning letters;•withdrawal of the products from the market;•refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;•recall of products;•fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits;•suspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals;•suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;•refusal to permit the import or export of our products;•product seizure; or•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates.
In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or corrective advertising, institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or civil or criminal prosecution by the government, any of which could harm our reputation and business.Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of, and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.In the United States, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products.
The ACA is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.Among the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidate are the following:•an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products;•an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;•expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;•new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices;•extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;•expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;•expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act’s pharmaceutical pricing program;•new requirements to report financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;•a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and•a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.President Trump ran for office on a platform that supported the repeal of the ACA and one of his first actions after his inauguration was to sign an Executive Order commanding federal agencies to try to waive or delay requirements of the ACA that impose economic or regulatory burdens on states, families, the health-care industry and others.
The degree of market acceptance of IV Tramadol or any other product candidate we may license or acquire will depend on a number of factors, including, but not necessarily limited to:•the efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;•the timing of market introduction of such product candidate as well as competitive products;•the clinical indications for which the drug is approved;•acceptance by physicians, major operators of cancer clinics and patients of the drug as a safe and effective treatment;•the safety of such product candidate seen in a broader patient group, including its use outside the approved indications;•the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;•the availability of adequate reimbursement and pricing by third party payors and government authorities;•the relative convenience and ease of administration of the product candidate for clinical practices;•the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries, including any contradictions, warnings, drug interactions, or other precautions;•the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for a companion diagnostic, if any;•the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;•the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;•limitations or warnings contained in the product’s FDA-approved labeling;•changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications for our product candidate or future product candidates, which could reduce the marketing impact of any superiority claims that we could make following FDA approval; and•potential advantages over, and availability of, alternative treatments.If any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is not perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance.
We may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any replacement manufacturers.The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or the DEA, restricts the importation of a controlled substance finished drug product when the same substance is commercially available in the United States, which could reduce the number of potential alternative manufacturers for IV Tramadol.21TABLE OF CONTENTSOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates or products may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis.We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials.
