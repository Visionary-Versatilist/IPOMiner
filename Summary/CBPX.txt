number of significant restrictions and covenants that generally limit OpCo’s ability to, among other things:•incur or guarantee additional debt;•create or incur certain liens;•make certain loan advances;•engage in acquisitions, consolidations, mergers, changes of control and sales of certain assets;•pay dividends and make other distributions;•make optional payments and modifications of junior debt instruments;•engage in certain affiliate transactions, sales and leasebacks and pledge transactions;•make certain restricted subsidiary distributions;•engage in certain lines of business or activities; and•modify certain agreements.The credit facility limits our ability to engage in these types of transactions even if we believe that a specific transaction would contribute to our future growth or improve our operating results.
in an active trading market for our common stock, the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.Some of the factors that could negatively affect or result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include:•actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;•changes in market valuations of similar companies;•changes in the residential, commercial or R&R construction markets;•additions or departures of key personnel;•actions by stockholders, including the sale by Lone Star of its shares of our common stock;•speculation in the press or investment community;•general market, economic and political conditions, including an economic slowdown or dislocation in the global credit markets;•changes in interest rates;•our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;•changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;•changes in accounting principles;•changes in tax laws; and•passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or the building industry.These and other factors may lower the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.
All of our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we are expecting, including:•cyclicality in our markets, especially the new residential construction market;•the highly competitive nature of our industry and the substitutability of competitors’ products;•disruptions in our supply of synthetic gypsum due to regulatory changes or coal-fired power plants ceasing or reducing operations or switching to
