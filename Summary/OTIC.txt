potential regulatory approval and commercialization ofOTO-104,the-15-Table of Contentsdevelopment ofOTO-311and other potential candidates for the treatment of inner and middle ear disorders is a key element of our long-term strategy.OTO-311is currently in preclinical development and is therefore currently most subject to the risks associated with preclinical and clinical development, including the risks associated with:•generating sufficient data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;•obtaining regulatory approval to commence clinical trials;•contracting with the necessary parties to conduct a clinical trial;•enrolling sufficient numbers of patients in clinical trials;•the timely manufacture of sufficient quantities of the product candidate for use in clinical trials; and•adverse events in the clinical trials.Even if we successfully advanceOTO-311or any other future product candidate into clinical development, their success will be subject to all of the clinical, regulatory and commercial risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to develop, obtain regulatory approval of, commercialize or generate significant revenue fromOTO-311or any other future product candidate.Risks Related to Our Business and StrategyClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive
Clinical trials can be delayed, suspended or terminated for a variety of reasons, including failure to:•generate sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;•obtain regulatory approval, or feedback on trial design, to commence a trial;•identify, recruit and train suitable clinical investigators;•reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;•obtain and maintain institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each clinical trial site;•identify, recruit and enroll suitable patients to participate in a trial;-16-Table of Contents•have a sufficient number of patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•ensure clinical investigators observe trial protocol or continue to participate in a trial;•address any patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;•address any conflicts with new or existing laws or regulations;•add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;•timely manufacture sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials; or•raise sufficient capital to fund a trial.Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the
FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including:•our inability to satisfactorily demonstrate that the product candidates are safe and effective for the requested indication;•the FDA’s disagreement with our trial protocol or the interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;•the population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assess safety in the full population for which we seek approval;•our inability to demonstrate that clinical or other benefits of our product candidates outweigh any safety or other perceived risks;•the FDA’s determination that additional preclinical or clinical trials are required;•the FDA’s non-approval of the formulation, labeling or the specifications of our product candidates;•the FDA’s failure to accept the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract; or•the potential for approval policies or regulations of the FDA to significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for our product candidates, the FDA may grant
