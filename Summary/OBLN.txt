Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock.We are currently a single product company with limited commercial sales experience, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future
A number of factors that are outside our control may contribute to fluctuations in our financial results, including:Øpatient and physician demand for our Obalon balloon system, including the rate at which physicians recommend our Obalon balloon system to their patients;Øpositive or negative media coverage, or public, patient and/or physician perception, of our Obalon balloon system, the procedures or products of our competitors, or our industry;Øany safety or efficacy concerns that arise through patient experience with our Obalon balloon system;Øunanticipated delays in product development or product launches;Øour ability to maintain our current or obtain further regulatory clearances or approvals;Ødelays in, or failure of, product and component deliveries by our third-party suppliers;Øintroduction of new procedures or products for treating obese or overweight patients that compete with our product;Øadverse changes in the economy that reduce patient demand for elective procedures; andØperformance of our international distributors.It is therefore difficult to predict our future financial
factors that negatively impact our product, or result in decreasing product sales, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Physicians and patients may be slow to adopt and use intragastric balloons, and adverse events or other negative developments involving other companies’
to patients for a variety of reasons, including:Ølong-standing relationships with competitors and distributors that sell other products and their competitive response and negative selling efforts;Ølack of experience with our products and concerns that we are relatively new to the obesity market, or concerns that our competitors offer greater support or have larger amounts of resources than our company;Øperceived liability risk generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;Ølack or perceived lack of sufficient clinical evidence supporting clinical benefits;Øreluctance to change to or use new products;Øperceptions that our products are unproven or experimental; andØtime and skill commitment that may be required to gain familiarity with a new system.We are also aware of
and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues.In addition, factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our Obalon balloon system and any other products that may receive FDA approval include:Øthe inability of our sales and marketing personnel to perform their duties and conduct business in a manner that is compliant with our internal policies and procedures and FDA law and regulations;Øthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to recommend any current and future products;Øthe lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;Øunforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; andØefforts by our competitors to commercialize products at or about the time when our product would be coming to market.Our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our Obalon balloon system will depend to a significant extent on our
treatment with the Obalon balloon system may be influenced by a number of additional factors, such as:Øthe success of any sales and marketing programs, including direct-to-consumer marketing efforts, that we, or any third parties we engage, undertake, and as to which we have limited experience;Øthe extent to which physicians offer the Obalon balloon system to their patients;Øthe extent to which the Obalon balloon system satisfies patient expectations;Øthe cost, safety, comfort, tolerability, ease of use, and effectiveness of the Obalon balloon system as compared to other treatments; andØgeneral consumer confidence, which may be impacted by economic and political conditions.Our financial
We may encounter production delays or shortfalls caused by many factors, including the following:Øthe timing and process needed to assimilate the changes necessary to enable our production processes to accommodate anticipated demand;Øshortages that we may experience in any of the key components or sub-assemblies that we obtain from third-party suppliers;Ødelays that we may experience in completing validation and verification testing for new controlled-environment rooms at our manufacturing facilities;Ødelays that we may experience in seeking FDA review and approval of PMA supplements required for certain changes in manufacturing facilities, methods or quality control procedures;Øour limited experience in complying with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or the QSR, which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements for medical devices and applies to the manufacture of the
business, including:Øinterruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier’s operations;Ødelays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier’s failure to consistently produce quality components that meet our specifications;Øprice fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components;Øinability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;Ødifficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;Øinability of suppliers to comply with applicable provisions of the QSR or other applicable laws or regulations enforced by the FDA and state regulatory authorities;Øinability to ensure the quality of products manufactured by third parties;19Table of ContentsRisk factorsØproduction delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications; andØdelays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers.Although
Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:Øthe costs and expenses of establishing our U.S. sales and marketing infrastructure and our manufacturing operations;Øthe degree of success we experience in commercializing our Obalon balloon system;Øthe revenue generated by sales of our Obalon balloon system and any other products that may be approved in the United States;Øthe costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our products under development;Øthe costs and timing of developing enhancements of our Obalon balloon system and obtaining FDA clearance or approval of such enhancements;Øthe emergence of competing or complementary technological developments;Øthe extent to which our Obalon balloon system is adopted by the physician community and patients;Øthe number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;Øthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;20Table of ContentsRisk factorsØcosts of operating as a public company and compliance with existing and future regulations; andØthe extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.Additional financing may not be available on
as:Øwell-established reputations and name recognition with key opinion leaders and physician networks;Øan established base of long-time customers with strong brand loyalty;Øproducts supported by long-term data;Ølonger operating histories;Øsignificantly larger installed bases of equipment;Øgreater existing market share in the obesity and weight management market;Øbroader product offerings and established distribution channels;22Table of ContentsRisk factorsØgreater ability to cross-sell products;Øadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer higher discounts or incentives; andØmore experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, performing clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances.Competition with these companies could result in significant price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our
our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which in turn could adversely impact our business and results of operations.24Table of ContentsRisk factorsChanges in coverage and reimbursement for obesity treatments and procedures could affect the adoption of our Obalon balloon system and our future revenues.Currently, intragastric balloon products are not reimbursed by third-party payors.
These risks include:Øforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;Øa shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;Øpricing pressure that we may experience internationally;Øcompetitive disadvantage to competitors who have more established business and customer relationships;Øreduced or varied intellectual property rights available in some countries;28Table of ContentsRisk factorsØeconomic instability of certain countries;Øthe imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls, regulations and laws;Øchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;Øscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us; andØlaws and business practices favoring local companies.If we experience any of these events, our business,
Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.Our costs could substantially increase if we experience a significant number of warranty claims.We provide limited product warranties against manufacturing defects of our products.
