expanded market penetration of our HTG Edge platform and related proprietary panels, and future development and approval of diagnostic products, are key elements of our growth strategy that will require us to hire and retain additional sales and
future diagnostic products or the demand and commercialization costs of such products, or manage our anticipated expenses accordingly, our operating results will be harmed.Our future success is dependent upon our ability to expand our customer base and introduce new applications.Our current customer base is primarily composed of biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and molecular labs that perform analyses
new products or changes to existing products to meet developments in NGS instrumentation, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.If the utility of our HTG Edge system, proprietary profiling panels and solutions in development is not supported by studies published in peer-reviewed
for our products will depend in part upon the research and development budgets of these customers, which are impacted by factors beyond our control, such as:•changes in government programs that provide funding to research institutions and companies;20Table of Contents•macroeconomic conditions and the political climate;•changes in the regulatory environment;•differences in budgetary cycles;•market-driven pressures to consolidate operations and reduce costs; and•market acceptance of relatively new technologies, such as ours.We believe that any

A material liability claim or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products could harm our business and operating results.The sale and use of products or services based on our technologies, or activities related to our research and clinical studies, could lead to
regulatory agencies in the future which could increase our costs and delay our commercialization efforts, thereby materially and adversely affecting our life sciences business and results of operations.In the United States, our products are currently labeled and sold for research use only, or RUO, and not for the diagnosis or treatment of
until we are in compliance, which would reduce our revenues, increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.In the event that the FDA requires marketing authorization of our RUO products in the future, there can be no assurance that the FDA will
