sales and marketing capabilities, further commercialization of our T-SPOT.TBtest, and research and development, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for at least the next few years, even though we generate revenue from
The degree of market acceptance of our T-SPOT.TBtest will depend on a number of factors, including:•clinical guidelines relative to the screening for, and diagnosis and monitoring of, TB infection;•the efficacy and potential advantages of our T-SPOT.TBtest over alternative tests;•the willingness of our target customers to accept and adopt our T-SPOT.TBtest;•the ability to offer attractive pricing for our T-SPOT.TBtest;•the strength of marketing and distribution support and the timing of market introduction of competitive products; and•outcomes from clinical studies and other publicity concerning our T-SPOT.TBtest or competing products.Our efforts to educate physicians and other members of the medical community on the benefits of ourT-SPOT.TBtest
new industry standards could render existing products obsolete or result in short product life cycles or our inability to sell our T-SPOT.TBtest without offering a significant discount.If we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct sales representatives and independent distributors, we may not be able to generate anticipated
business would also be harmed if any of our suppliers could not meet our quality and performance specifications and quantity and delivery requirements.Certain of our customers account for a significant portion of our revenue.We sell our T-SPOT.TBtest through a direct sales force in the United States, certain European countries and Japan.
Even if we cover our losses, our business, financial results and reputation could be materially harmed.Billing complexities associated with obtaining payment or reimbursement for our tests may negatively affect our revenue, cash flow and profitability.Although third-party payors account for only 4% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012, we currently rely in part, and may in the future more
investors, our ability to retain the listing of our ordinary shares on The NASDAQ Global Market and general economic and industry conditions affecting the availability and cost of capital.Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring
risks, including:•problems assimilating the purchased technologies, products or business operations;•issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;•unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;•diversion of management’s attention from our core business;•adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•risks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;•potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and•increased legal and accounting compliance costs.We have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment.
connection with any such lawsuits, such amounts could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to substantial limitations.As of December 31, 2012, our available U.S. federal net operating losses, or NOLs, totaled $38.1 million and U.S. state loss carryforwards totaled $32.9 million.
or after this public offering, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs even if we attain profitability.23Table of ContentsRisks related to regulatory and other legal issues.If we fail to comply with extensive regulations of domestic and international regulatory authorities, sales of our T-SPOT.TB test in new markets and the development and commercialization of any new product
or promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under applicable statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.Additionally, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing, and we will be required to report adverse events and malfunctions related to our products.
to additional licensing requirements as we expand our sales and operations into new geographic areas, which could impair our ability to pursue our growth strategy.We may potentially be subject to product liability claims.The testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical diagnostic tests such as our T-SPOT.TBtest entail an inherent risk of product liability claims.
in:•decreased demand for our product and product candidates;•injury to our reputation;•costs of related litigation;•substantial monetary awards to patients and others;•loss of revenue; and•the inability to commercialize our products and product candidates.Any of these outcomes may have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and may increase the volatility of our share price.Our inadvertent or unintentional failure to comply with the complex government regulations concerning privacy of medical records could subject us to fines and
in the financial markets;•regulatory developments affecting our industry;•announcements of studies and reports relating to our products or those of our competitors;•changes in economic performance or market valuations of our competitors;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results;•conditions in the industries in which we operate;•announcements by us or our competitors of new products, acquisitions, strategic relations, joint ventures or capital commitments;•additions to or departures of our key executives and employees;•fluctuations of exchange rates;•release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding ordinary shares; and•sales or perceived sales of additional shares of our ordinary shares.In addition, the equity markets have recently experienced significant volatility, particularly with respect to the securities of life sciences companies.
