We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if, and as, we:•continue investing in our product engine to optimize vector engineering, manufacturing and dosing and delivery techniques;•continue development of our clinical candidate, VY-AADC01;•initiate additional preclinical studies and clinical trials for our other programs;•continue our process research and development activities, as well as establish our research-grade and commercial manufacturing
capabilities;•identify additional CNS diseases for treatment with our AAV gene therapies;•seek marketing approvals for VY-AADC01 or other product candidates that arise from our programs that successfully complete clinical
successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize, our current and future product candidates.
Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate certain of our product development efforts or other operations.We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development
future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:•the scope, progress, results and costs of developing our product engine, and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials for
Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.Risks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of Our Product CandidatesOur AAV gene therapy product candidates are based on a relatively novel technology, which makes it
market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be harmed.Regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have changed frequently and may
negatively impact our or our collaborators' ability to complete clinical trials and commercialize our current and future product candidates in a timely manner, if at all.Positive results from preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be indicative of
including:•perceived risks and benefits of AAV gene therapy-based approaches for the treatment of CNS diseases;•size of the patient population and process for identifying patients;•design of the trial protocol;•eligibility and exclusion criteria;•patients with preexisting antibodies to the vector that preclude their participation in the trial;•perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;•availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;•severity of the disease under investigation;•availability of genetic testing for potential patients;•proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;•ability to obtain and maintain patient consent;•risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion of the trial;•our inability to locate appropriately trained physicians to conduct such clinical trials, which may be particularly difficult for the
events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:•delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory authorities on trial design;•delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites;18Table of Contents•delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;•imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory authorities as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical
third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions;•delays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;•clinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a trial;•selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;•occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;•occurrence of serious adverse events in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; or•changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols.Any
may:•be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates, if at all;•obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;•obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;•be subject to changes in the way the product is administered;•be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;•have regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form

fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or ultimately commercialize any product candidate from the Optioned Programs in the applicable territories, or if Genzyme terminates our collaboration,
relationship with any future collaborations may pose several risks, including the following:•collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;•collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;•the clinical trials conducted as part of these collaborations may not be successful;•collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect
the product or loss in supply could delay our clinical trials and, if our product candidates are approved, result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our business, financial condition,
If we are unable to successfully manage the challenges of international expansion and operations, our business and operating results could be harmed.Risks Related to Our Intellectual PropertyOur rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates are subject to, in part, the terms
