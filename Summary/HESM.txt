reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read “Selected Historical and Pro Forma Combined Financial and Operating Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measure.”(3)Represents 100% of the total assets of Gathering Opco, HTGP Opco, Logistics Opco and Mentor Holdings as of December 31, 2016.(4)Each of our commercial agreements with Hess is dated effective January 1, 2014 and has a remaining initial term of approximately seven years.
We intend to use the net proceeds as follows:•approximately $218.1 million will be distributed to our Sponsors, in whole or in part as reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures;18Table of Contents•approximately $10.0 million will be retained for general partnership purposes, including to fund expansion capital expenditures and our working capital needs; and•$3.8 million will be used to pay revolving credit facility origination fees.If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units from us, we expect to receive additional net proceeds of approximately $35.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of Hess, the most significant of which include the following:•the effects of changing commodity prices and production margins;•Hess’s ability to successfully increase its Bakken production;•the inherent uncertainties of future production rates and the possibility that actual Bakken production may be lower than estimated;•the effects of domestic and worldwide political and economic developments could materially reduce Hess’s profitability and cash flows;•the substantial period of time required to complete large capital projects, during which market conditions could deteriorate significantly, negatively impacting project returns;•significant losses resulting from the hazards and risks of operations may not be fully covered by insurance, and could adversely affect Hess’s operations and financial results;•disruptions due to catastrophic events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect Hess’s operations and financial condition;•increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact Hess’s results of operations;•any decision by Hess to change its production plan, temporarily or permanently curtail or shut down its operationsor suspend or terminate its obligations under our commercial agreements in certain circumstances;•a deterioration in Hess’s credit profile could increase Hess’s costs of borrowing money and limit Hess’s access to the capital markets and commercial credit;29Table of Contents•state and federal environmental, economic, health and safety, energy and other policies and regulations, and any changes in those policies and regulations; and•environmental incidents and violations and related remediation costs, fines and other liabilities.Please read “Business—Our Commercial Agreements with Hess” for a detailed description of each of these commercial agreements.We may not generate sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders.In order to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.30 per unit per quarter, or $1.20 per unit on an annualized basis,
upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we handle on our assets;•the fees with respect to volumes that we handle on our assets;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies in our geographic markets; and•outages at our facilities caused by mechanical failure, maintenance, construction and other similar activities.In addition, the actual amount of distributable cash flow we generate will also depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control,
including:•the amount of our operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to Hess, which are not subject to any caps or other limits, in respect of those expenses;•the level of capital expenditures we make;•the cost of acquisitions, if any;•fluctuations in our working capital needs;•our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt instruments;•our debt service requirements and other liabilities;•the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner;•changes in commodity prices; and•other business risks affecting our cash levels.For a description of additional restrictions and
material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our unitholders.Our commercial agreements with Hess include provisions that permit Hess to suspend or terminate its obligations under the applicable agreement if certain
pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.Our exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.Following the closing of this offering, we expect that we will initially generate substantially all of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to unitholders.Rail car derailments in Canada and the United States have led to increased regulatory scrutiny over the safety of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail.
