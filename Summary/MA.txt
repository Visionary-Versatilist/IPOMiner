may be subject in the future, we may be forced to pay damages and/or change our business practices or pricing structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability.There are currently actions against MasterCard International in a number of state
our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.We generate revenue from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services and from assessments on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands.
to increase transaction volumes, we seek to enter into business agreements with customers through which we offer incentives, pricing discounts and other support to issue and promote our cards.
A significant loss of revenue or transaction volumes from these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss
of business for MasterCard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.Over the last several years, the banking industry has undergone rapid consolidation, and we expect this trend to continue in the
costs of accepting card-based forms of payment, which may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceedings and may increase the costs of our incentive programs, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability.We rely on merchants and their relationships with our customers to expand the
damage to our brands, which could reduce the use and acceptance of our cards or increase our compliance costs, and thereby have a material adverse impact on our business.If we are not able to keep pace with the rapid technological developments in our industry to provide customers, merchants and cardholders with new
